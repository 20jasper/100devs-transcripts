00:04
hope you're all doing well i hope you all had a good day
what's going on everybody get in here get in here
know how we like to do get on in here alrighty so a couple big things today
all right a couple big things today today will be a short stream uh we're
not gonna be on stream for that long because tonight
we're networking baby that's right we're networking so george stream
we're gonna get everybody on the same page we're gonna get people feeling okay
about the idea of maybe networking for the first time some for some of you this
might be your first networking event and so we're gonna try it
we're gonna we're gonna hope that the platform we use doesn't burn to the
ground because we've done it to a few other platforms before
but we're gonna come together tonight we're gonna talk about networking we're

00:05
going to talk about your introduction the the very beginning of
of the class right like sorry the very beginning of networking like starting
from the begin from the basics told you all i'm going to help you every step of
the way we're going to cover the basics tonight we're literally talking about
your introduction i think that's where the biggest source of fear
that little creep of anxiety comes in is literally just how do you start
conversations right so we're going to start that tonight together
uh the tweet for tonight if you haven't checked in yet you can always do
actually check in or just if you're on twitter you'll you'll see my tweet i said
no new friends i didn't want to use any hashtags i didn't want to use anything
that might bring new folks in because they don't know what we're about right
and so i wanted it just to be us going into the networking session so no
new friends for tonight we'll get new friends on thursday but for tonight just

00:06
us good old 100 devs right as always i always like to start off
class with uh with our questions you know let's start off with the question
and so tonight's first question is would you rather
infinite weightless pockets like pockets that are on your pants
or an infinite weightless closet so why do i have to throw weightless in there
because if if you have a bunch of stuff in your pockets you might like start to
not be able to move right and if you put too much stuff in your closet like it
might crash into the ground um so infinite pockets or infinite closet
a lot of people stay in pockets so this is one of those ones where the more
i think about it the more i i kind of like if you had infinite pockets

00:07
how easy is it to search through your pockets
or maybe like you don't go overboard maybe just like carry like all this
stuff that would go in the backpack you can throw in your pockets i don't know
right it's a little it gets a little odd right
infinite closet maybe it's a walk-in closet and i could always be able to get
to my stuff i don't this is a hard one i feel like i'm i i'm a one bagger i
like to travel with just one backpack so for me infinite pockets would be uh the
dream come true i'm going infinite pockets i was close to i was close to
closet i was very close to closet but the last second i'm switching the pockets
usually we got either or either or how heavy are the pockets they're
weightless that's the caveat they're weightless
all right folks thank you for always amusing me uh with your answers to these
silly questions at the beginning i i really do like seeing people's answers
to these questions it's a good way to kind of see how people think um
but i was like start off with some questions so regular questions for

00:08
tonight uh questions about things you might have coming up i'm happy to answer
a few questions as we let folks get in here for tonight
remo is giving me trouble don't worry we'll get there later on
what do you think of the stream deck i just watched linus's videos on it i was
actually watching this right before stream um i'm i'm amped
i really i really like the idea of a stream deck i think it's gonna it's
gonna be a game changer i think this would be okay i think it's gonna be way
bigger than people are planning i think it's gonna be big
we broke remo already maybe i think as people are kind of like signing up it
might be a little extra pressure but we separated it to like six different rooms
we'll see how it goes can we do the 15 minutes of pain
together we're going to do that on thursday together yeah on thursday we're

00:09
going to go over that stuff together um i so people ask like um
i'll actually explain this in a few seconds but
people said study groups yes today is your last day to sign up for the study
communities uh google forms went down over the weekend
google forms went down trash dev hey thank you for the raid hope you're doing
well hope your stream went well thanks for bringing the crew over
how was your stream thank you for bringing everybody by
trash death we gotta bring it back soon as soon as we see you live one of
these days we're gonna come right back hope you're doing well
yeah so the so for for folks that are coming from trash dev we we are
doing a 30-week software engineering bootcamp uh to normally we do classes
every tuesday and thursday uh tonight is our networking night and so it's it's

00:10
it's gonna be a short stream and then we're jumping on a different platform to
do a networking event just to get folks comfortable with the idea of networking
right as folks progress through our boot camp
aka starting next week they have to have
three network connections and two coffee chats and so we start practicing that
tonight uh trash i hope your stream went well thanks for bringing everybody bye
cool uh so we were talking about this idea of
oh the study communities so google forms went down over the weekend um and so
when it went down we got like a lot of messages so you have until to end the
day today basically until let's say after normal class time tonight and then
we're kind of locking down the form if you need the form it's on follow along
materials channel i'll bring it up on the slides as well in a few seconds

00:11
but then we're going to start adding folks and we're gonna specifically add the
um location groups first um because some folks might wanna do their own type of
networking right uh that they might be able to join us live right now because
they're in a different part of the world and so we're going to fill out those
first you're going to start seeing folks get added to those soon
we tried everything underneath the sun to mass add roles it's just i don't
think it's possible in discord so myself and the valiant mods have
stepped up we're going to add people manually to roles which is going to take
us a long time but we're going to slowly
do it over this week so you should start seeing people get added to study
communities as early as tomorrow and then it's just
going to be rolling as we have time we're going to keep adding folks so
hopefully by this time next week we have everyone in their study communities and
it's going well yeah there's a lot of bots we tried none
of them just did it well or did it consistently and so

00:12
rip let's just let's just get it done yeah always hey shout out to the mods
they do way more than y'all ever will know uh they're in the muck
they're they're the front line when it comes to um
making sure this community stays the community that we all love right so
always a big shout out to the mods let's get into it
so tonight we're going to talk about how to network we're going to cover one of
the biggest things which is the introduction and then we're going to try
doing a networking night we're going to talk all about it how to do it how to be
involved in it and we're going to talk a little bit about the homework because
we're getting an extension so we've extended the homework deadline until
next tuesday and i'm going to talk about that in a second
all right you haven't checked in uh just for intended sake it's not for growing

00:13
the community today it's just so i know that you're here uh liking and retweet
the tweet uh some folks don't know drake lyrics
or a lot of other people's lyrics but no
new friends is just a joke we're talking about no new friends tonight we didn't
want it to reach other folks they have no idea what 100 devs is because we're
doing networking we don't want random people just joining us they have no idea
what the heck's going on so tonight was no new friends
thursday we'll get the we'll get the friends coming back
this is the the last time i will mention the study communities if you have not
filled out the form to join the study community of your choice today is the
last day we won't be adding any more folks to
study communities until maybe a little bit further into program as we have the
ketchup crew and things like that but for now today's your last day to get in
you can fill out this form right here it's also in the following materials
channel on discord um if you're if you're following along ever like if

00:14
you're not following along live like you're on youtube
shout out youtube crew um first thing i always say is make sure you're on our
discord leonewell.com discord it's linked in the video description below
you can do exclamation point discord here in chat to always get to that
discord quickly everything i ever share in the slides is always almost always in
the following materials channel anyway so last day to join the study communities
we got a lot of great groups a lot of kind of like affinity groups and then also
good location-based groups that you can all join and we just hope that these
study communities just create a little bit smaller of a community for you to
belong to to work with each other uh you
all have your own private voice channels a bunch of fun stuff
yeah if you already did the second form you're good there's this is not like a
third form it's just it's the second form yeah
yeah i feel like these groups are gonna help me feel more connected that's

00:15
that's the goal that's what i hope for that's what i hope for
alrighty submitting work there's no work due tonight uh so don't
worry about submitting anything this this evening or morning or wherever
you're coming from uh so no work to do tonight
and the homework that was originally scheduled for thursday we're gonna push
until tuesday okay we're gonna push until tuesday so
all your layouts right all your layouts are due tuesday i know you had to read
uh the flexbox work i know you had to do flexbox froggy i'm just not asking for
proof that you did it you don't have to turn in anything tonight to prove that
you did flexbox froggy i'm just assuming
that you did flexbox froggy uh so we can touch on it later yeah but
work that was supposed to do thursday do next tuesday it gives us a whole
another weekend to get through it thursday's class we're gonna get in
review and go through some of the layouts together right so if you're if
you're if you're at that point now thursdays we're going to talk a lot

00:16
about this a lot of you are about to enter the trough of sorrow
most of you are not yet in the trough of sorrow you're you're going you're going
down the hill but you haven't hit the bottom yet
so on thursday we're going to talk about what it means to hit the bottom
and then we're going to spend a lot of time breaking down the layouts together
so you're not starting uh by yourself we're going to do a little bit of
pomodoro live like a live pomodoro work session so you can get some some work in
ask tons of questions um and we're pushing the work until tuesday
and this is a a big thing about what i think makes
100 devs different and one of the things that i think is really important to me
as an educator and that's that i don't have a rigid structure that i have to
stick to right if i feel like the community needs a
little bit more time on something guess what we're going to take a little bit
more time on it if there are things that i think people are really freaking out

00:17
about guess what we're going to spend time on it one of the things that kept
coming up was leon i don't know how to start networking i don't know how to
like introduce myself great we're going to do that tonight you're going to do it
with friends you're going to do it with the community that's here to support you
so if you're worried about networking tonight you're going to do it in the
confines of 100 devs not to worry about anybody else we all are beginners here
we all know that this may be our first time networking so we're going to create
a a safer space for you to test this stuff out right for you to flounder a
little bit and then to get it right by the end of the night right so we're
taking tuesday all night tonight just to network with each other to get those
jitters out to make sure we feel comfortable so that next week we can
maybe start trying to do it for realsies right and then thursday we're gonna
spend time going over the layouts it seems like a lot of folks need a little
bit more time they need a little bit more
a little bit more room to to to kind of grasp what's going on and to see it live
a little one more time and so we're gonna make sure we have that time to do it
and then we have the weekend and so you'll have

00:18
the weekend to get through it and yeah and the beautiful thing is that if
you're like leon i already got it i'm feeling good well guess what you got a
bunch of push work that you could be doing um
between now and tuesday so you have the ability to go deeper if you want to make
them write write your bad code first and then write your bad write your bad code
and then write your baddie code right like make sure that you can be pushing
yourself in this time and so i feel like there's a there's room for everyone
right now and we're gonna make that room for everyone always right networking
i need at the time of demanding eight to five job well hey i'm glad you got the
time you need all right was independence day assigned because
they networked with aliens no that's good though i'm using that that's
mine now that's that's that's when everybody asks me why are you assigning

00:19
it um that's what i'm gonna say never been with a baddie oh that song is
just stuck in my head cool already networking
we're going to take some time tonight to get the gears to turn in
right to get the gear as a turning we're going to practice our
introductions we're going to practice the awkward i'm plopped into a virtual
networking what do i do right don't switch on yourself that's why
independence day was decided exactly um we're gonna get the gears turned in
i i i don't want you unless you feel comfortable to start this week with the
networking i want you to push networking to next week let's practice tonight
and let's say the folks that you meet tonight count for this week
right so if tonight you meet somebody that that that you like that that counts

00:20
as your three and then if there's somebody that you feel like is a good
fit maybe a coffee chat right and so tonight we're gonna we're gonna say this
week counts for a hundred devs right next week we're gonna start trying to do
it for realsies and it won't be three and two next week it'll be one and one
right the d will be one and one next week and then we'll do two and two the
next week and then we'll do three into the next week so we're going to keep
ramping up and we're going to keep ramping up so
don't feel like you have to like this week hit hit five right that that's not
what we're doing right that's not what we're doing we're easing into it this
week 100 devs counts next week we're trying
to do one and one week after that two and two then three and two right so
we're trying we're gonna we're gonna keep it up right and
the the networking right with 100 devs is supposed to be this might be our
first time so i need everyone to give each other grace tonight i need everyone
to realize that some folks might be really

00:21
nervous around this idea and that's why we're doing the spaces tonight
remember our goal when we're networking is to turn strangers into friends
right that's that's the only goal the only thing you're shooting for
right the only thing you're shooting for
when you're trying to do this networking and realize
that it's not always gonna work out that's okay it's okay
if your networking doesn't work out right it's okay that you don't click
with every single person right it's okay that it takes you a
while to find your people right the beautiful thing about being
virtual is that it's easier to kind of move around
right it's easier to move around right it's easier to to kind of pop in and out
of spaces because before you you had to be a little a little like
a little eager right if you go to a conference and you're by yourself at a

00:22
conference you gotta there has to be something in you that like pushes you to
like walk up to a group of people and talk to them it's harder but with this
virtual networking it's a little bit easier to kind of get the ball rolling
and so tonight that's what we're going to do so tonight your only goal is to
turn maybe a stranger into an acquaintance maybe you meet them you
figure out what their discord is you see them kind of around right you're trying
to turn these people that we see in the 100 devs community from strangers into
acquaintances and this will not be our only networking session right we're
going to use other platforms we're going to do other things that i think are
really cool right that are really cool to like meet each other and hang out and
interact with each other so tonight don't put all that pressure
on you for this to be perfect tonight's about practicing your introduction it's
about maybe making a few acquaintances right a few people that maybe when you
see their their their their discord name fly by on one of the channels you'd be

00:23
like ah i remember that person right now i feel a lot of people
when they first start this idea of networking i'm going to give you a a way to
introduce yourself that i think works in a lot of certain and a
lot of scenarios but doesn't work in every scenario it's gonna be the one
that we practiced tonight but a lot about networking is sometimes
kind of like reading the room right sometimes you'll be in a more
professional setting and sometimes you'll be in a more laid-back setting
right and so if you're in a real professional setting you might be a
little bit more formal in how you do your introduction and if you're in a
laid-back setting it might be a little bit different and so a lot of times
you gotta read the room what type of event are you at are people
in like suits and ties like are people passing out business cards or are they

00:24
eating pizza and drinking beer right and if you're a person where
that's hard like reading the room is hard trust me it gets better
right it does get better as you do it more but you can also pair up with a buddy
right sometimes folks like to network in pairs so that way you
can both kind of read the room together and so that's something that you might
want to keep in mind especially as we get into the smaller study communities
it doesn't have to be just you on your own type of endeavor
there are many ways to kind of use each other to help read the room to figure
things out but what i'm going to do is i'm going to share you the way that i
introduce myself the most and we're going to talk about it because
i think for most people it feels a little weird at first here it is i say hi
all right and literally stay off by saying hi
and then i start off by saying my name is all right so i say hi

00:25
my name is sugar slim shady no okay sorry say my name is and then i say leon
i say hi my name is leon i'm a software engineer
i help people build full stack web applications i'm trying to learn how to
network better and uh it's really nice to meet you all right
i mean let me say that let me say this again now you don't you don't say leon
you say your name right so don't don't say leon say your name this is an
example but you're gonna say your name right so you're gonna have to practice
it with your name in there just in case in case you didn't get that okay
you're not leon you well maybe you are lee i don't know but you have to put
your name in there okay so i know it sounds silly
but this is something that i think some people might struggle with and so i
really wanted to be clear with it so i say hey my name is leon i'm a software
engineer i help people build full stack web applications i'm trying to learn how
to network better uh nice to meet you all and the reason why i say it this way

00:26
is because i'm trying to break down like five different things trying to make
sure people know my name i'm trying to make sure people know
my title or like what what i do right so i make sure they know my title
then i make sure they know what i do and then why you are here right if
you're at a meet up i always try to tie my greeting into like what the meetup is
about somebody put a meetup idea in chat for
me put up put a meetup idea and and chat for me knitting larping bowling
dominoes all right so we're going to go with
we're going to go with bowling dominoes and knitting
hey my name is leon i'm a software engineer helpful people build
build full stack web applications i'm really interested in learning how to knit
uh i have a lot of my clients that are into knitting and so i'm just trying to

00:27
learn how to knit better uh nice to meet you all now in that scenario
what sounded weird what what sounded weird like what did what what what felt a
little a little icky at first the title felt icky there right like if
i'm at a knitting meet-up right i'm at a knitting meet-up and i
walk off to people hey my name's leon i'm a software engineer i help people
build full stack web applications i'm here to learn how to knit like that's a
little that's a little weird right but if you're at any type of tech event
right if you're at any type of tech event it wouldn't feel exactly supposed to
disconnect it wouldn't feel disconnected right so sometimes you have to read the
room and think about like what room am i in who am i um
who am i introducing myself to right but

00:28
if you're at a tech event this this type of of of introduction is fine
right if you're at a knitting event or a bowling event
right this exactly this context doesn't really matter right
but when you're in tech you want you want to be able to meet other engineers
you want to meet other folks that might be doing full stack web development
right and so that's important information they give out there
and at first this type of pattern really does feel icky like for some reason
people don't feel super comfortable saying that they're a software engineer
and they help people build full stack web applications right but you have to
like embrace right you have to embrace your inner bob vance
anybody know what i mean by that you have to embrace your inner bob vance

00:29
yeah exactly uh so bob vance is a character from the office the tv show
the office and no matter whoever bob and no matter who
he ever meets throughout the show he always introduces in the same way i'm
bob vance vance refrigeration i'm bob vance vance refrigeration hi there i'm
bob vance vance refrigeration right you always know that he's bob vance of
vance refrigeration and it sounds silly but if you if you needed something to do
with refrigeration you would know to go to bob vance from vance refrigeration
right like instantly you know and so it can seem a little
out of place when you're just introducing yourself to somebody in the
office but if you're at a tech event it actually makes a lot of sense because
it's going to help you identify folks a little bit quicker and it makes you
sound professional af it really does make you sound professional right and so
hey i'm leon i'm a software engineer how
people build full stack web applications um i'm here at this event i'm trying to

00:30
learn how to network better uh it's really nice to meet you all right
and like that's that's how i would introduce myself to a group of people
that's how i would introduce myself to maybe like two or three people that are
that are eating pizza right it it it's a
little bit more formal it's a little bit more professional
it might feel a little icky at first but it gets easier the more you do it
right and it really does help people know who you are what you do
and as long as you kind of tie back into like why you're here
then it's fine okay now sometimes if it's a really chill event
i'll i'll drop off the the the what i do and i'm gonna even drop off my title if
it's really like an informal event but if i'm at a conference i'm at something
that's not recurring i'm going full full intro right full intro what if you're

00:31
currently a student doesn't matter this doesn't matter what you currently do
this has nothing to do with like right this works for every single person
that's listening right now uh i don't i don't care what your job is
if you're a student uh this this is this this works for you
and you got to start practicing it now right
and then the beautiful thing is the more you practice this the easier it gets
doesn't matter if you're unemployed this works for everyone right
the easier you do this the more you do this the easier it gets and you're gonna
find what works for you right networking is about what works for you
do i carry business cards no more i used to
i don't anymore um just because i found something that's comfortable for me and
business cards really aren't comfortable for me anymore
i think if if i get to the point where i'm giving you a business card i'd
rather just give you my email um or my twitter or something like that
yeah but i have a lot of friends that feel differently i have a lot of friends

00:32
that love business cars and they still carry them they still give them out it's
about finding what's comfortable for you but i want you all to try this tonight
right i want you to try this tonight should we go to conventions in a suit
and tie not engineering conventions no i think you might be very overdressed
but it depends you can always ask business casual at least right if you if
you're feeling kind of one way but a lot of tech conferences you're going to see
people in shorts and t-shirts all day long yeah
people will think you're a recruiter exactly so
although that i want you to practice this tonight
i want you to maybe find something tonight that feels good for you too
right i want you to want to find something that feels good for you too right
practice the formal one because i feel like a lot of people maybe haven't had
that experience where they're more formal in networking so i want you to
practice that tonight i want you to do this a couple of rounds we're practicing
the more formal one and then maybe as the night goes on you're getting a bit

00:33
more relaxed try and maybe shorten this or add to it and find what works for you
and what makes you feel comfortable as you're introducing yourself
but when you do the more formal one it can feel ickier at first but trust me it
works it's how a lot of more senior engineers are going to introduce
themselves like engineering managers uh vps things like that so get used to that
kind of language right and um it'll get easier at times
do you wear pants or shorts during online meetups uh
i mean that that's that's a that's a that's a binary choice there i i mean
there are other options other options there and for a million channel points you
could see the other options as well exactly only a million channel points
and the other options unlock themselves for you um there's like a secondary
that's too far because there's like another camera that

00:34
only the only advanced people get so yeah all right
remember even the folks that you meet tonight follow up right practice your
follow-up uh practice your email practice that
saying hey it was nice to meet you um practice the
the providing value right for even the people tonight like if you find that
there's somebody that you that you connect with uh practice your follow-up too
right uh and if there's somebody that you
think might be an interesting follow-up and you want to practice a coffee chat
ask them to uh to a coffee chat as well right and so the idea here is tonight we
just want to get some practice in we want to start with practicing our formal
introduction we want to practice uh kind
of just getting to know each other being in an environment where we get to meet
other folks from 100 devs and then practice your follow-up with a few folks
as well right we're going to take tonight easy it's going to be for us to

00:35
kind of maybe for the first time in a while like talk to other human beings
specifically in a digital space right but it shouldn't cause you too much stress
um we're all here doing this for the very first time
for a lot of us for the first time this this is a space where it's only 100 devs
folks there's nobody else that's going to be here it's just folks from 100 devs
and so i need everyone right now to agree to a few things
one of those things is to use the sheet right if you meet folks that are that
you're that are interesting right use the sheet
i need everyone to commit right now to only showing up tonight to this
networking space if you are gonna give room for folks
that don't feel comfortable doing this if you are already some elite networker
that feels like they're light years ahead don't show up tonight
right go do something else right i want i want folks that are new to this to

00:36
know that this space is for them i want folks that have anxiety or i don't feel
comfortable networking to know that this space is centering them above anybody
else so if you come to this event and you're you're all firing on all
cylinders and you're not giving people space and time to
to practice and to maybe try introducing themselves a couple times in a row the
space is not this is not for you okay this is for everyone that needs some
time to practice that wants to meet some
other folks from from 100 devs and we're going to do it in an environment that
supports them please don't be an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tonight
i am fast and loose with the band hammer i i will i will ban you as quick as i
possibly can if you do certain things tonight if tonight
you don't give space for beginners you don't respect that folks might be brand
new to networking bam if you're a creep ban nobody wants to date you bam right

00:37
like if be a normal rational human being give people grace right
give people room to experiment to figure out what works
for them and doesn't work for them right don't be a creep
if i even get a like a like a like a like a like a like somebody farted three
rooms over and i can just like the very very faint smell ban right
uh people are gonna snitch on you and i'm gonna ban you and i'm gonna feel
really good about it because for some reason when the cameras
come on and the mics come on people lose their minds and they can't be decent
human beings so tonight be a decent human being or it's a ban you have no
place in this community nobody is interested in you becoming their best friend
nobody's interested in you dating them no one's interesting in anything
romantic endeavor tonight don't be that person if you are that

00:38
person let me know right now so i can i can ban you right
don't meet someone and then for the next two weeks be every single tweet they do
like follow them around that's harassment we're going to ban you
like i shouldn't have to say this but but i have to say it right
so please tonight's about people practicing about people networking
if you can't be a decent human being if you can't realize that people are here
to network not because they like you but
because they want to practice networking
leave you have no part in this community and
differences i will find you and then i will ban you exactly um tonight
you don't have to use a webcam but it is preferable
uh you do need at least a mic right so if you don't have a mic or a webcam
tonight's not the night we'll have other nights where you can do
text-based networking right you can do text-based networking tonight

00:39
it's mics and cams it will work on your phone too it's a
little bit a little bit harder to make it work
but it is it is mics and cams tonight if you don't have a camera that's okay at
least just try the mic if you don't have access to a micro
camera that's okay we'll have text-based
networking another night later on um but for now
uh anything where you can talk into it a headset microphone anything like that
works most laptops have it built in all right
and we're gonna practice uh when you meet people practice using this sheet
pretend that this is a real networking event where you're where you are
where you are introducing yourself to strangers with the idea of becoming
acquaintances or friends right you're practicing your introductions you're
practicing your follow-ups and you're practicing using the sheet
right so that's what tonight's for uh the first couple of rounds that we're
going to do on remo so we're gonna be using a platform called remo right

00:40
the sheet for folks that don't remember just in case is where you track your
networking if you're new here we track our networking in the sheet you can
click the link in the slides you can do exclamation point sheet here in chat
it's that google sheet that you see in chat right now we're using remo
and remo has been good to us in the past but we're about to have thousands of
people on the platform we might try this and everything goes to hell right
we might try it and everything goes to hell
uh and in that case like if everything goes to hell
right and remo just doesn't work uh remember uh you now have extra time to be a
baddie and write bad code right so we're gonna we're gonna hope that remo works
right uh we're gonna give it our the good old 100 devs try
uh we're broken up into six different um into six different

00:41
versions of remo but if for some reason it crashes it's not working i'll put an
announcement on discord saying hey we gave the whole the old 100 devs try and
then you're to take the extra time tonight to be a baddie and write bad code
okay so that that's what happens if for some
reason remo doesn't work that's what you're going to do
all right remo is a very interesting platform the way it works
right the way it works is that there are tables
it's kind of like club penguin for adults there are tables
and when you click at the table it puts you into a
video chat space with everyone at that table
right so when you click on a table like you can see you can see that i'm like in
this table in table one if you were to join my table everyone at
that table can turn on their cams and mics and everyone can see each other in
that table okay there are let's see hundreds of people in each of

00:42
the rooms so far it actually spread out pretty evenly um thank you for like
not just all trying to get into the first one because it the actual there's
that actually there's um there's one that's actually bigger than
the first one which is pretty cool to see uh so the the idea here is that
your tables are limited to six you can sit down on the table
you can see people's uh cams and mics you have to turn on your camera mic when
you're at the table uh it is a it is a buggy platform
give yourself some time to try and figure it out
um if you you sometimes have to like turn on your camera mic their buttons
turn on your camera mic it might be a little weird while you're
trying to figure it out but you'll figure it out um just kind of play
around with it until you do but the idea is that you'll be at a table with five
other people and then you'll be able to turn on your cams and mics
when you do that you're going to practice your introductions uh you
should do two rounds of introductions right hi my name is leon i'm a software

00:43
engineer right i help people build full stack web applications
i'm here because i'm trying to learn how network better uh nice to meet you all
right and so you're gonna try practicing that
and everyone at the table is gonna try practicing that twice
right by practicing that twice after everyone gets their two practice
rounds in i've given some kind of simple like fun starter questions on discord
right some fun practice questions on just like fun to get the conversation going
questions on discord start with those questions get everyone answering talking
make some friends get to know each other right and then
after about 20 minutes or so you're gonna see me pop on i'm gonna go live
and i'm gonna shuffle you all and so you're all gonna be shuffled onto a new
table and then you're gonna do it again and then i'm gonna move to another group
i'm gonna shuffle the tables again and we're just gonna keep this table
shuffling for a while all right so um we'll we'll take a break

00:44
at the top of each hour right we'll take a break at the top of
each hour just like we do normally during class how to make sure we're
staying healthy hydrated things like that and then we're just going to get
that practice in so your first round might be really weird might be really
awkward that's okay you're going to get a bunch of these rounds in we're going
to keep shuffling tables and you're going to get better at it and better at
it and better at it it's going to get easier and easier and easier right
and so this is tonight the practice okay now if for some reason no raid tonight
so we're gonna jump right into the platforms uh for some reason it all goes
to hell remo hates us uh it all burns down to
the ground uh i'll send out a message hey it didn't work out tonight uh extra
time to be a baddie and write bad code work on your work on your um

00:45
work on your layouts and on thursday we'll have more time to do more layouts
together also remember your homework is to work on those layouts layouts that we
covered in class right the layouts that were extra in that homework right are we
all saying we're software developers yes because we're all here to be software
engineers right we're all software engineers we all build full stack web
applications you could probably practice exactly my
script and i think that'd be a good idea but if you're shooting for something
else or something else that feels better to you go for it but i think that's a
pretty good place to start cool questions before we before we start the
the networking tonight we got questions you can codes good
is mayonnaise an instrument if you know what you're doing
i might throw up is that okay absolutely go throw up first and then come join us

00:46
i can't interact the sheet because you have to make a copy of it um you can't
interact with you have to make a copy of it come back for a rate i need shadow
points yeah no rate tonight because we're going to jump right into the um to
the the events uh and the events will go until class
time is over so we're gonna go the full three hours
will airpods work for mike they should yeah they're gonna give linkedin tips
eventually yeah yeah there's too many people on that
main sheet if you haven't downloaded it before give it some time wait until
folks are in remo and then try coming back to the sheet again
it's not broken it's just too many of you all trying to download it
but it's the same one that we've we've covered like four or five times in class
now so i don't want to make sure i just make
sure you know it's like not a different one yeah khan yeah you could

00:47
do i have to network for three hours yes yeah i think i might have to begin each
of the events so you probably can't jump right in uh you might be like in the
lobby waiting in the event because we haven't started yet
well i'd be networking too absolutely we have the hourly break in between
networking yes we'll do the break at the top of the hour
are we coming back here after class no we'll end on remo
can't wait to make folks i'm so excited me too yeah
should we be introducing ourselves as software engineers or our current jobs

00:48
as a software engineer we join late you can if you're here now join us
i drink for tea for coffee chat absolutely yup two rounds of intros through the
icebreakers and then if you have more time whatever you want to talk about
it's up to you if your table doesn't want to do the iceberg because that's okay
we do this again yeah we're going to do this again we're going to use a bunch of
different platforms so this one doesn't work we'll buy another one too oh
yeah there's some quirks to remo there's some quirks remo so if it like i
said if it doesn't work for you this evening that's okay
um go ahead and and work on your layouts yeah uh people are saying linux doesn't
is not supported yeah it might not support linux you might try your phone

00:49
though if you have a phone we joined mike only yep
yeah i already said we're gonna do a break like we always normally do cool
all right folks we are going to i'm going to end the stream
uh try and go to your uh location the one you signed up for on remo and
uh all the links to the different remote slots are as always in the following
materials channel right cool all right i'm gonna end the stream uh no
raid we're gonna jump right into remo and try getting this working uh good
luck godspeed remember manage your frustration this platform is finicky try
and figure it out if you can't figure it out for some reason you can't get in or
something like that um go ahead and work on your layouts for the rest of the

00:50
evening but i hope to see a bunch of you on remo uh let's have some fun remember
six different ones so i have to jump to six different ones to let folks in so go
wait until in the lobby for me to get started and we're gonna start very soon
