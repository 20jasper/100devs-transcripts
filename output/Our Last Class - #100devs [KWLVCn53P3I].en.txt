00:00
hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hey [Music]
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah good morning good afternoon
good evening no matter where you're coming from let's go
I hope you are doing well we don't get got we don't get got indeed we go get
let's go last class I'm so excited that you all are here

00:01
we got some some some things to reminisce some things to celebrate some
thank yous to be had but uh let's just let's just take it in for a moment as a
community has taken chat let's take in the the the the twitchness I hope
you all are doing well first try Melody Dev hey thank you for the gifted
subs and congrats huge huge thank you all so much for being here
don't cry don't cry yet it's so good to see you all uh it's so
good this get to spend uh another morning afternoon or evening with you
and uh we got some fun stuff to get into so things are going to talk about some
things that we're going to celebrate it ain't the end though it ain't the end

00:02
this community is just getting started uh until tonight we celebrate that just
a little bit oh there are some folks that sneaked in
today I I like I I saw even in the celebrations channel uh I was counting
up the jobs I was counting up the jobs and I do uh what [Music] [Laughter]
D5 d8 DC a thank you pretty good this house uh I was counting up the jobs and um
I don't keep track of them during the cohort
and different a thank you for being here I don't keep track of doing the core I

00:03
think that's too much for me to focus on each one coming in uh so
I like that Focus to shift like once graduation once today's done I shift my
focus it comes all about Focus getting the job uh I I try to lean into the
stand-ups I try to lean into [Music] um that that Focus so I I don't pay
attention to it during the cover I think that's the wrong Focus because truly if
you got in the job already that's great but you're ahead of the curve you should
be like applying now not applying but like networking your way in now Micah
hey thank you if you get the subs uh and so I was going through it and uh
I really thought it'd be like 50. and I was like all right we'll get we
have like 50 in the bang it's kind of where it was the previous cohort maybe
maybe maybe 75 I see them come through and I just texted my life I was like

00:04
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on like it's just
it's not stopping I'm screenshotting I'm
screen chatting I'm screen chatting like it's it's literally not stopping uh it
was way more than I ever imagined at this stage of program because we're just
getting stuck started yes Tonight is the last class but this community is just
getting started with the hunt uh until blew my mind we're gonna talk about that
in a bit though get in here uh we always like to start off as you
know with the questions and stuff like that we're gonna get to there in a
second uh as you know I always put lyrics on every slide
uh the slides the slides aren't the aren't the ones on the nightbot uh
because I don't want people to be able to like peek ahead but um
I always put lyrics on every single slide deck I've ever made I put the
lyrics on there and uh this lyric means a lot to me and I think it means a lot
for our community and so this is 21 Savage's reply

00:05
to folks calling them out from being from the UK and I and I love this
uh he said I'll risk it off from a name I was coming hard before I came I ain't
know nothing about no Visa I was in the park with the gang mom's been feeling
bad I try to tell her she's not to blame no social security couldn't get a
license but I still didn't complain I went and got it we are not the same
we're not the same folks everyone that's here right now is not the same we came
we got it because we go get and I don't know how to say it any better than that
but we came and we got we didn't get got we came and we got
we are not the same each person that showed up that's given up their nights

00:06
their weekends their their their their free time to uh to to pursue a dream to
pursue a better life from themselves to pursue
a better life for their family to pursue a better life
and actually went about it cause so many folks Reach Out Leon How
Can I code how can I learn how to do this how can I do this
so many folks think they want it they'll even say they want it but they're not
ready to carry the boats and the logs and each person
that continue to show up class after class week after week month after month
putting in the work you're not the same you're built different
you have something in you that other folks don't have

00:07
you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] software engineer but more than that you got heart
it takes a lot to continue to show up so I don't care where you're at in the
process I don't care how deep in the hunt you are I don't care if you're on
class one or class 69 you're not the same
you decide if there's something that you wanted
and you put in the work to get it done unlike thousands and thousands of other
people that say they want it but they kind of want it
they're not willing to put in the work so I want you to carry that with you
through tonight through the rest of our time together as
we kind of wrap up the things we need to
wrap up with this cohort but for forever
there's people that say they're about it
and then there are people that are about it you're about it
and no matter what comes your way no matter how hard the Hunt is I want

00:08
you to know that I believe in you this community believes in you and
you'll get where you want to go match your frustration be consistent
and take care of yourself you're not the same cool
all right so tonight I got a lot of thank yous I need to throw out there
a lot of things I want to say we're going to talk about what's next
and then we're gonna we're gonna hang out we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
we're gonna do some stuff together this evening so as always I like to give
folks a few seconds to get in here you got questions I got some answers

uh will we get a questionnaire for the stats at some point yeah uh wall and I

00:10
are gonna be working on a couple different surveys that we'll be sending
out post program uh one will be just like feedback like
hey what things you want to see change what things uh went well what didn't go
well like really trying to figure out how we could
improve things and then the other one it'll just be like hey tell me all the
good stuff that happened um tell me about your clients tell me
about your jobs tell me about your open source projects like a lot of the stuff
that just happened throughout the cohort we like to keep track of it
um just so we can share it with the community and and and do something cool
with it and hopefully Inspire folks that are still in the catch-up crew uh to
inspire folks that might want to do a possible next cohort um so yeah
Jasper with the strategy thank you not gonna do more you know what you need to
do if you want to see the the real stretching

00:11
oh anahydrate thank you for the hydrate cheers to you let's go cool
some Channel points like they're going out of style

could get free merch because we're all about the free stuff we're gonna talk
about that in a bit uh we'll we'll have merch later on but there's gonna be a
way for you to get free merch so we're going to talk about towards the end uh

merch available then as well as always I

00:12
don't make any money off the merch we we sell it at Cost as cheap as we can make
it cool release the office hours videos nope
no unfortunately not uh there are some perks of going through the program live
and that's one of them are we doing a cohort three uh is that
actually a that's not on me that's on yawn we're gonna talk about that in in
the in the end back in review we'll make it onto to
YouTube we're still behind on YouTube now that we're we're done with class and
I have more time um we'll be able to upload everything cool

00:13
all right everybody thank you for the questions let's get into it hey
you said this you and this community motivate me every day I feel the exact
same way all right folks important stuff this Friday T spill
I will be at six o'clock in our classroom in our classroom no on Discord
old slide uh six o'clock on Discord t-spill uh if you have me coming to
these tea spills you're missing out uh really just phenomenal information
uh phenomenal just like gems being dropped like real boots on the ground
experience of what it's like to really get a job so definitely check out these
t-spills uh there's just stuff that I can't that we
can't say outside of them and so to really ask real questions about what

00:14
it's really like to get a job the real nitty-gritty the things that work that
didn't work uh that's Friday and we're gonna keep them going
t-spills are going to keep going um into the holidays and we have a lot
of books that got jobs so I think we can kind of keep this going uh for for a
while because I really think it's important I think it's where we share a
lot of the important bits on how to get a job and when it's like the real
experience is really like mm-hmm uh we're still going to keeping up our
Sunday office hours so uh not this Sunday I'm taking I'm taking the weekend
off folks not this uh what you're saying connection
network error two uh that's not on my end it seems like it's on on they're

00:15
running ads or something that's weird let's see no I'm alive
yeah I think I think they tried to run as for some reason
I didn't see any spikes of mine so yeah it must have been them trying to run ads
or something cool switch was taking a break too
exactly uh so Sunday I'm taking this Sunday off but we'll be back next week
uh we're also doing daily stand-up uh so every single day uh we have stand up
and hmm yeah I think that's on twitch's side wasn't wasn't bothered on mobile

00:16
yeah what is up with people getting jobs today what
why share on Discord please have you got a job today please put it in the
celebrations Channel Leon Hunter does thank you got a job today
I would show that I quit I could about eight weeks ago getting back into class
like what that's wild [Music] um that's wild six figures a congratulations
which doesn't want you to uh to to graduate
Mara redeemed a spicy rant Mar what's your spicy rant
uh pedagogy the oppressed positive version how you use it to improve

00:17
people's lives interesting okay so so a positive spicy rant
I'll figure out how can I make it spicy but positive all right education is
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's start there so if you didn't see it they redeemed a
spicy rant uh the way that I teach was heavily impacted by a book called
pedagogy the oppressed uh the core tenant is this idea that the oppressed
are just as equally able to lead their education as the oppressors and
it fundamentally changed how a lot of folks teach and for me uh
it has probably been the biggest impact on my pedagogy uh so no testing no

00:18
quizzes uh nothing where I am the Arbiter of your except of your success
right uh even things like me giving you solutions to problems
is a problem because why am I here to say that your stuff is better than my
stuff or my stuff is the correct way of doing something and so you'll notice
that a lot of stuff has always been binary does it look like the salon
website does it look like the brownies recipe does it you
decide whether or not you have achieved the goals and the objectives yes I am
here to shine a light uh but I am not here to dictate what success looks like
for you also why I don't have a curriculum because having a curriculum
is oppressive it means that I am the one in control of what we do and how we do
it and that's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I rather see how folks are going and if

00:19
we need to take three weeks to cover a topic we take three weeks to cover a
topic if I planned out two weeks to cover something and it takes us a class
well then it's my job to figure out how the next class should be the thing that
we should be moving on to and so this idea that there are a lot of things in our
educational model that are pretty just damn bad there's also
this idea of banking models of Education there's a lot of things that just come
up that we've just been ingrained into how education should be and the thing I
love most about a hundred devs is we're proving that we can throw it all out and
have amazing results right you don't need to pay tens of thousands of dollars
you don't need to have an in classroom experience you can do it

00:20
online from the comfort of your own home or library or wherever you watch these
classes you don't need you don't need a lot of stuff
that the traditional system says that we need and
that's been the grand experiment with 100 devs because I didn't know if it
would work and as you're hearing the T spills there's some OG's and then there
are some triple ogs and um we we did it in increments right we we
had this first like five week course where I was like can I teach online
and then we did a a a smaller like cohort and we got jobs and then we did a
bigger cohort and we got jobs and we have a lot of stuff to build
the current way 100 devs Works still lets folks fall through the cracks there

00:21
are still things that we need to improve and fix to make sure
that everyone has a fair shot at getting a job that could fundamentally change
their lives and we're going to talk about that I I have
some ideas about ways I think we can do it uh I have some ideas about what I
think the next version of 100 Dev should look like but I want to work with y'all
like there is no next cohort without the community coming together to build with
that next cohort looks like and that's what I'm most excited about once we've
gotten past graduation and once folks have gotten jobs and they have the
energy and time to pull folks along with
them what could that really look like at scale and I think
we have an opportunity to do something really really special

00:22
there are so many folks that reach out that are built different just like we are
that just need a fair shot at working hard a fair shot at an educational
opportunity that doesn't cost money that they'll never their family will never
see in their lifetimes a fair shot at realizing that not everyone has the
privilege of sitting through this much Educational Opportunity without making
money and so I think we're gonna talk about that at the end of today I think
there's a lot of things that we are in a unique position to change fundamentally
about education how people learn how people support themselves while they're
learning and can ultimately change their lives and so that's that's the goal
and we're living it we're absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] living it

00:23
the the number the amount and this rant will come to an end the amount of hate
you have to endure to do good on the internet right now is absurd
the number of comments that I get the emails the messages the replies about
how what we're doing is wrong or or or they just don't like the way that we
teach or they don't like the things that I say like the haters
they can all go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] themselves we got hundreds of jobs
we got hundreds of jobs hundreds go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself stay mad big mad

00:24
we're gonna keep getting jobs and once we get jobs we're bringing
three more folks along with us so you can you can keep shining your your
Golden Gate not realizing that we walked around it a year ago
keep polishing it that's all you're worth [Laughter]
uh so yeah thank you for the rant uh you gotta you gotta spend those Channel
points folks um repetagogy of the oppressed it's a dense
book it's not an easy book maybe read The Cliff Notes I think there's a lot of
stuff that once you like actually think about it you go wait a minute the whole
like the whole education system just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cool
all right let's go back to what we signed up to do hey I got I gotta I

00:25
gotta do you sending the channel points I gotta do it
thank you thank you for the hydration cheers to you posture check thank you
stretch all right thank you alrighty uh once again we're doing daily
stand-up we have 500 plus people in these stand-ups every single day uh we
go through a technical coding question we've been building up
uh yesterday we saw sets and how we can start using sets to solve problems uh
today we just answered questions because I wanted to make sure we had a lot of
time for questions because tomorrow we have t spill but Monday through Thursday
we have stand up Friday we typically have tea spills if we don't have a
t-spill we have stand up but come through uh the thing that makes me super super

00:26
excited is that I know there are 500 plus people still working every single
day towards getting a job because they keep showing up to stand up and I'm sure
there's double that that can't make it that time but uh it's it's a really it's
really motivational and I'm gonna keep doing them if people keep showing up so
definitely show up we do about 20 minutes of reviewing data
structures and algorithms type problem and about 10 minutes of answering
questions from things folks are running into right now
cool uh some some wins we should talk about throughout the cohort
245 plus hour stream live on Twitch this cohort 245. on Twitch
then we also have Discord which I couldn't find any analytics on how to do

00:27
it on Discord but 245 hours streamed of class
and office hours and then we're probably like another 40 plus hours on Discord
because we switched to doing our our power hours and our in our in our
tea spills and all that stuff on discords we're probably like 300 hours
just live together and that's just me that's not stream team
you include stream team we're a thousand hours of content easily uh for folks
that are going through this cohort so I think it's just amazing to sit back and
think if you came to every class that's 245 hours you've you've invested
in your education and your future and your career and nobody could take that
from you you're built different let's go our community this cohort this isn't

00:28
like in total because we still had stuff from last cohort this cohort
300 plus of y'all helped and volunteered with the
Grassroots organization or non-profit 300 plus people
took their coding ability and helped a Grassroots or or a non-profit 300
took their skills and bettered the world with those skills what let's go
thank you 350 plus of y'all contributed to open source or free software projects
350 plus of y'all and these are just the

00:29
people that tell me this stuff because I know there are some of you that are on
this this stream right now that have done this Grassroots stuff that have
done this open source stuff and just didn't fill out the form or posting
celebrations Channel I see you fill it out when the survey comes out
next week fill it out so I know 245 hours I just want you to fill out a form
please or please please just so we know 100 plus of y'all Grassroots
350 plus of y'all open source contribution you are open source contributors
you know how I know that you all are open source contributors because people
be emailing me Leon we have a lot of folks from 100 devs using our service or

00:30
contributing code let's talk because when something when something good gets
found out y'all just Zoop and so I know y'all outside y'all
outside you online I see y'all half a million plus in client work half a million
plus and I would like I I was trying to pull these numbers together it's way
more than half a million I I was still counting at like 600 but
500 just half a million just sounds better but it I know it's over 600 at least
and I know a lot of y'all just don't tell me
and that's the beauty right the beauty
if you live up you don't owe me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if
you don't want to fill out the form
don't fill out the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] form I don't care
that's the beauty of 100 devs you could go you could never say anything you can

00:31
never do anything you could still get the value out of it
you could still get all the benefits in the world and I appreciate you all the
same I appreciate you all the same but this is the books that do let me know
and so I know it's it's above this right and as I was going through
as I was going through and I was pulling together the the job just the job posts
the wild thing is I was just like trying to screenshot all the jobs
is that like for every job there were like three people saying they got a client
and the the amount of money that they were making while they were going
through a program I can't that's that's the whole point

00:32
that's all I want to build education should not just be free it should be paid
not everyone has the privilege of free time to educate themselves and not make
money and so to see that we brought in over a
half a million dollars while you were learning that's that's
that's the point that's it that's all I care about that's the future
time is a luxury that not everyone has and if we can figure out how to make
this work that unlocks it for everyone and so this is the number that I that
the next number is great but this is the number that I'm proud of
the fact that we were able to take the skills that you work so hard on and get
value and give value to clients and those clients gave you real money

00:33
that's huge and then counting so far the jobs from just this cohort
just this cohort we're over 200. like this is what I was doing I was like all
right here are the the ones I pinned from last cohort like over a hundred
jobs last cohort easy I pinned 50 of them in the channel you can only pin 50
in the channels like all right let me let me let me let me get the screenshots
of all the rest and I was thinking I'd be here with like
50 and you'll see the time stamps it was just it was just three four hours I was
just screenshotting jobs you ready so this I think this is funny this is in
the celebrations Channel my reaction when I go through those pin stories
people making 14 an hour and getting written offers for 150 000 I wonder how
life-changing it is for though I love them and then this person got a job

00:34
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom and some of these are like
cohort one mixed in the beginning I just just folks that post in a celebration
Challenge from this year boom boom boom boom boom boom boom [Music]
boom boom hold on hold on [Music] nah where's that where's that hype [Music]

00:35
yes I'm talking about [Music] um 200k what
I need to make one of those tick tocks where it's like uh from the Drake lyric
don't don't tell me you ate an educator if you ain't got 200 jobs like don't
don't say you're a model unless you've been invoked I just need to do this and
then it just needs to like stream through this is the person that posted the

00:36
original meme [Music] I got a stretch this is tiring foreign [Music]

00:37

00:38
doing the tea spill tomorrow folks foreign too much winning thank you let's
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go 10 second warning

00:39
10 second warning five second warning foreign [Music] thank you [Music]

00:40
all right that was a little egregious laughs oh boy oh boy oh my [Laughter]
God thank you for the hydration ayo
and we're just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] getting started
folks we're just getting started most of y'all haven't even started the hunt yet
we're at 200 from this cohort alone and we're we're not even
we're not even like in the hunt for most of y'all like what let's go now

00:41
for the triple triple ogs I've mentioned this once before um
but we were almost not named a hundred devs I always went with the 300
there's some like sus stuff around like history that I didn't want to like name
us the 300 because of but that was my goal
I'm not a person that likes to like put my big goals out there like I understand
that the psychology behind doing it I like to just
I like to set the goals internally and when I hit them I let you all know
and so my Big Goal where I was like I sat down and I was like if if I did this
and we really knocked it out the park what would that look like
I was like 50 jobs I've done that 100 jobs I've done that with RC like if I'm
gonna do this online we're going to open

00:42
it up to as many folks house like 200. I was like yeah 200 somewhere and I was
like nah 300. so 300 was like my pie in the sky like if I put in two years worth
of work like that's when I would be happy about it and uh we hit it
that's not where we're stopping because we're just getting started folks the
fact that 500 of y'all are still showing up to stand up every day I know that
everybody can make that time so there's like a thousand plus of us that are
still gearing up and readying for the hunt there's no reason why we have to be
a hundred devs or the 300 it should be above a thousand right and so if you are
here right now I am going to ask you for one thing
I don't ever like to ask you all for anything in fact you can disregard what
I'm about to say this should be completely free free of money free

00:43
aspect free of expectations free of anything coming my way
but I have I have an ask if you are here help each other get across the finish
line that's it how many of us are there right now I
look before the before the great blackout well now we're at 1700.
we're over 1700 folks that are still carrying the boats and the logs so if
you're one of the 200 this cohort when you're part of the 300 that have already
gotten jobs from 100 devs I want you to turn around and the first
thing I ever told you is bring three more so if you've gone through turn around
bring three more with you I don't care what that looks like whether that's
helping people on Discord helping people that reach out to you on Twitter turn
around and bring three more with you because if the 300 turn around and bring

00:44
three that's everyone here all right the folks that are still showing up to
stand at the folks that are ready to carry the boats and logs that's the deal
right it's all it is just help the you gotta add the 300 to it that's 1200.
we're taking some creative Liberties so and then you got to realize that those
three then turn around and bring more so it's exponential we're talking like
quadratic here like it makes sense quick maths right you bring them along
and we all get there if you're still here don't give up
that's it you heard it from folks in the celebrations Channel you heard it from
folks in the T spill manage your frustration be consistent and take care
of yourself and you will get on this list as well there is nothing

00:45
stopping you from getting a career in Tech other than you giving up
that's all there is we're Community taught through and through
this community will not let you fail if you lean into the community
if you ask questions on Discord you'll get those questions answered if you show
up in voice channels people will help you if you show up to
any of our events people will help you Community taught through and through and
if you've already made it through it's time to turn around and bring more
folks with you we have a chance to do something really special
something that's never been done before something that could change the lives of
folks around the world and we owe it to ourselves to take that

00:46
shot to not give up to push to make things better to push to help more
individuals and to give a little bit more time to those that need it
we're just getting started cool now a lot of folks are saying thank you in
chat that's great I don't like the thank yous because here's the thing
I didn't do the work I I get to make tweets that honestly
make me look pretty good but I didn't put in that labor
I didn't put in that work I Shine the Light yeah I did stream a little bit I did
some stuff but uh you did the work I can't force you to do it

00:47
I can't make you show up I can't make you do the homework do your code Wars do
your Anki you put in the work and so while it's nice to say thank you
I I don't like it you put in the work you are the Arbiter
of your success the good things that are happening to you or will happen to you
would have happened without me because you are built different
you decided to change your life you decide to put in the work you
decided to not give up you decided to do things that thousands and probably
millions of other people won't do the things that they say they want to do
but don't want to do so for that we're doing that for showing up time and
time again I am immensely immensely thankful
because I had a dream I had something that I wanted to build

00:48
but it required you all to to give me a little faith to give me a little belief
and then to put in an immense amount of work to you all put in that work
and you deserve all the good things that are coming your way
so I got some thank yous I gotta say uh before we get into the thank yous
though it's just it's honestly the community first right this community is
amazing this community continues to show up support each other to take care of
each other and in line with that our our Three core tenants our manager
frustration be consistent you're consistently showing up and the third is
take care of yourself and so we are going to take care of ourselves right

00:49
now we're at the top of the hour even though we're having fun we're
celebrating our wins it's still important that we take care of ourselves
we're healthy if you're able please get up move around

hell yeah can't wait scarlet and violet comes out I'm pumped

00:50
reading all the leaks and having a good time everybody welcome back welcome back
so we I said I need to say some thank you first and foremost Community or
Community taught through and through but there's a lot of folks I want to say
thank you to uh while we while we have everyone together tonight uh before we
get into some other fun stuff that we're gonna be doing soon so
first thank you to my wife really big thank you to my wife and my new little one
um to to say Hey you know this thing that I used to spend a lot of time doing
freelancing that makes us a lot of money
I'm not going to do that anymore in fact I'm gonna do this thing that costs us a
lot of money and takes up most of my weeknights and at least half of every
weekend for two years uh so the fact that uh Not only was my

00:51
wife super cool with that but overwhelmingly supportive uh carrying
the burden on a lot of stuff at home to make sure that I could do this um means
a hell of a lot to me so even after we had a little one and the
little one didn't do too well and got better like to to go through that
emotional roller coaster and still be supportive of everything that we're
doing here uh means a hell of a lot to me so first and foremost my wife
and my little one because I I missed out on some stuff because we're here
all right a big thank you uh to our mod team
uh and I'm gonna spend a few seconds here uh because it's it's really
important uh you have no idea what it takes to make this work like you

00:52
really don't and it started in the beginning so
you'll notice I have the current mod team here and some OG mods here so I'm
going to start off by saying some things um
when we first started talking about the original boot camp
the the amount of vitral this community faced the most vile and most disgusting
things you could think of were posted in our twitch chat and it's because my day
job is helping black and brown folks get jobs as software engineers and people
online hated that and they hated that I proudly said that's what I do and that's
what I spent my life work on so when we first started on Twitch
it was an absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show

00:53
I I mean I've been called some things in my days
as a black man you you get you you get desensitized to it a little bit but
being live being black and being proud of it
the stuff that used to come into this chat was ridiculous and Alyssa
was the person that made sure that none of y'all saw it
so Alyssa is not with us these days but in the beginning the reason why we
were able to do what we did was because of them otherwise
this wouldn't have happened we would have left I just would have stopped uh
so Alyssa waded through the muck uh to make this start uh and so
always will have my thanks and then okayla and Jesse and OCC uh

00:54
picked up the mantle uh throughout the first cohort and helped us shape this
community uh in ways that still Ripple today
and then we have our current mod team and I can't tell you
how much these people mean to me that they give up
all hours of their day because being a moderator is not like uh you're on
like I'm live Tuesday Thursdays Sundays but mods are always on and they're
always on Discord they're always in the chat and they're making sure you have a
phenomenal experience every day we delete stuff from Discord
every single day we have some people that

00:55
just don't know how to act we have spam we have stuff that the mods are so quick
to remove to have passionate discussions about whether or not these things are
right for our community do we want these
things to to continue and if you've ever had a good experience at a hundred devs
it's because of the mods blah and I talk once a week
and every good thing that I have come up with has either come from blah or blah
has at least said not a good idea good idea so all the cool stuff that's
happened at 100 devs has been because of them
uh shaping huntober shaping uh how we run class uh shaping how we build out
project team so behind the scenes blah or director of community does just that

00:56
uh and I would have been lost in the sauce without them to have that sounding
board to make sure I'm going in the right direction each week uh that's all blah
uh next the The unsung hero of Discord our Discord would Screech to a halt if
it wasn't for diff Curry like it would just break it would just stop working uh
from helping us build out the threading system that we use in all the help
channels to making sure those help channels actually run like there's so
much stuff that breaks doesn't work or messages
that get lost in the sauce that they're constantly surfacing to make sure that
the community keeps running uh so literally the tools that we use
have come from divker they're constantly
showing new stuff constantly making sure that we're making Discord as best as it

00:57
can be and the front line of going through every single type of request
every single message the the moderation that happens happens because divker
brings it up in our mod channels and then we take action so
thank you divker I really do mean it like this does not work without you uh
Chris one of our our fearless moderators has constantly been a source of
comfort for so many folks that are going through 100 devs for folks that are
going through the roughest of times Chris has sent some beautiful messages
that have made the difference and so many people's lives because we
know that this is a roller coaster we know that there are ups that there

00:58
are downs and they have the biggest skill when it comes to
helping people just be okay Miriam OG as well
through the thick and thin not only responding messages not always not only
just always rolling up their sleeves but also making sure that I'm okay
sending me messages to say like keep doing it or checking in to make sure I'm
okay or that that meeting sounds a little weird how you feeling about it
has always come at the right time and helped me do the things that I want to
do on top of all their moderation Duty so a huge thank you
uh indifferent ghost is the person that keeps me sane
uh because nobody has ever done this before

00:59
uh nobody has done what we're doing live and at scale and tried to pull as many
folks as we can forward and everything I tell you this but every single class I
don't know if I'm doing it right and that imposter syndrome gets in like the
the lead up the class is always nerve-wracking to me and indifferent is
always the person that has grounded me that has experience teaching boot camps
has been like no we're doing the right thing we're helping these people uh and
so they've always helped with the direction of program but also just
letting me know that it's working and that we're actually helping and we're
doing the right thing and so uh without indifferent I would have given up long
time ago uh Kieran an amazing moderator uh that was always

01:00
bringing happiness to the moderation team but also always making sure that
when the rest of us were asleep things were still running smoothly
uh we're a global community and they made it that and
we wouldn't have been able to do a lot of the things that we did uh without them
Yolanda or cat emotion has always stepped up in the most
when we need the most they're there the messages that they've shared the things
that we've asked of them to do for this community they've done our T spills they
they've shown up time and time again and added a level of calmness and
and and kindness to this community that I'm really thankful for
and then we do a lot of I I try to take gambles I don't call them gambles but we

01:01
think of big ideas and we try to see if they'll work and so telescope thieves
really helped us figure out project teams and if we could have teams of
folks working and building on stuff and they really made sure that folks came
together that were able to build the first iteration of project teams and
really help lay their frown like the groundwork for what I think is going to
be coming next and and so a huge thank you to that
that's the moderator team I I hope you all realize that none of this works
without them and I hope that there are some of you here
that want to rise to that challenge too because we're going to need more of
y'all we're gonna need more moderators as we continue to grow
just these few people have brought our community from zero to over 43

01:02
000 people this is it thousand people and this is it
for keeping everything running volunteering their time giving up their
nights their weekends it's mind-blowing thank you to the stream team my goal is
for us to be Community taught that's the thing I care about the most
I do not want to be the only person instructing I do not want to be the only
person shining a path forward I want us to collectively bring folks into the
careers that they want without the stream team we would have
lost a lot of folks a lot of folks that were stuck that needed help that needed
a different way of visualizing seeing things doing things to review homework

01:03
together to to continue to push to provide motivation on the days that we
weren't live our community would have withered very quickly
and the stream team is what helped our community grow and and be more than just
one person to really be a community to really be Community taught
and I didn't know it would be these people but I am thankful every day that
it was my wolf has shown up time and time again for all of y'all the most
difficult topics they try and break down they don't try they do they break down
in ways that make sense with compassion and kindness and pulling you
begrudgingly through homework spending hours
hours what was it 12 hours like just hours through stuff that you would have

01:04
had to have done alone and the fact that so many of you didn't
have to do it alone 14 hours thank you for travesty
is the beginning of community taught so Community taught starts with my wolf
hello it's Rufio has consistently helped us do things that the community needed
I think uh they're back dating the GitHub I think through uh their streams
where they started bringing other folks into the community
hello truffio has time and time again shown up for this community help folks
learn and to keep pushing once again not alone
and fox fox has brought warmth to this community provided a space for folks to

01:05
continue to do things like their code Wars to do things that are honestly just
hard by yourself but to do it together best living up to community taught
and then the OG stream team which first made this possible dab who you heard
during the T spill single-handedly brought dozens of y'all into jobs
OCC paved the way for a lot of folks in this community to continue learning and
to believe in themselves that they could actually learn this stuff too
so to the stream team a huge thank you we're Community taught and these folks
show us every single day what that means then we have a whole host of folks that
have been helpful uh and there's no way I can list everyone I'm just gonna list
the folks that have been tagged up and I'm hoping to tag out more of y'all in
the coming weeks as we kind of get these surveys out and folks say who's been

01:06
helpful so these are folks that have been helpful in the past but it is not a
comprehensive list when we do one of our follow-up classes I'll have more folks
to add here because there are a lot of you that aren't on here that deserve to
be on here and I'm going to add you so folks that continue to show up and help
our community in different ghosts who who I've I've talked about who has had a
huge impact on all of us and our community Rascal 2 who's continue to
show up time and time again for this community from everywhere from YouTube
to Discord to Twitch to the help channels they have been
instrumental in this cohort actually making it leveler ski wallet
folks from the OG ogs that were continually in our in our channels when
there was nobody else answering questions pulling folks along
I'm immensely thankful RAV who you know from our raids that continues to show up
in our Discord day in and day out Nick has given

01:07
Untold hours of their time to help folks even early on we were getting into
things like react and of course uh the fairy job mother Stephanie who uh has
been doing an immense amount of one-on-ones that has been coming to our to our
to our Monday sessions it'll continue to come to our Monday sessions that have
given us the templates and the things that we need to to get our jobs I am
immensely immensely thankful to you all and for the folks that are not on this
list you will be but for the folks that give up their time for the folks that go
into the help channels and answer a question I am immensely thankful
people always ask me what can I do to support you what can I do to help 100
devs and my answer is always I don't want your money
I want you to go into the help channels and help somebody and you know what
a lot of folks don't a lot of folks will cap a lot of folks

01:08
will say Haley and I love 100 devs I want to I want to help I want to help
but what they're really saying is I want clout
okay put put me on put me on stream uh share my book
go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself if you want to help get in the help channels
and actually help that's it that's the best way you can
help I don't want your money I want your time not everybody wants to give it
so for the folks that do literally the folks that do that is the thankless
unsung Heroes of 100 deaths I'll say it better
they're exactly there are people that want the vanity as saying they help
others and then there are people that just get in the trenches and help

01:09
that's it there's no way I could think of it and I want a small army of folks
that want to get in the trenches and they want to help and for the folks that
are on this list they're one of those people so thank you
if you've ever answered a question on Discord thank you if you're saying Leon
I'm inspired I want to help I want to do good go go answer questions on Discord
most questions always have answers but they could always have more
if you ever see a question that doesn't have an answer please that's what I want
we also have alumni mentors that have shown up to help our study communities
that started that continue to be an extra set of eyes on on Discord and
continue to help shape this community not just

01:10
getting the job or or completing program and disappearing but coming back and uh
continuing to pull more people along uh one of my
one of the happiest moments I had this year was honestly just looking at a voice
Channel and seeing so many of these people a year plus later
just hanging out talking that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] community
right there's there's no other proof to it than that
to literally see people on this on this list that got theirs a year plus ago
that did what they wanted to do finish program and then literally a year later

01:11
are just on voice channels just because just hanging out just talking
that's Community that's Community taught and so I'm thankful for all these folks
that signed up to help others that pull other people along thank you
uh thank you to the project team that helped us figure out some stuff and how
we might have groups within 100 devs that build stuff that we can all use uh
thank you Reddit um realistically most people are here
because they came from Reddit and um while I I I have my concerns with
certain portions of it I love me some Reddit and I think we would be a way
smaller Community um without without it so for everybody
that came from Reddit what up of course thank you 21 Savage
uh without 21 Savage uh all of our apps wouldn't work because they all run on
2121 and uh thank you for inspiring a lot of our projects and the things that

01:12
we built uh thank you for your latest collaborations with Drake uh you
continue to be a source of inspiration for our whole community
and then thank you to every single person that showed up
and I say this specifically because there are a lot of y'all because I got
the receipts like I got I got the analytics folks I
know that there are a large portion of you that have come to every single class
and have never said a damn thing that I've never typed on Discord have
never typed in this chat have never gone to Remo um I'm glad you're here
full stop I don't care if you're just a lurker that's okay we need lurkers too
but um thank you for showing up when I talk about all this folks I talk
about the community I'm still talking about you
because you're built different you continue to show up you continue to help

01:13
folks find us continue to bump us to the top
and uh I hope if you're one of those folks that have never typed
and you have the ability to help you decide to
put an emoji in chat if you want or just say anything now it doesn't be no maybe
it'll be on Discord maybe it'll be in our events later on but um I'm thankful
that you're here and I hope that you continue to stay part of the community
even if you've just been lurking so graduation if you have been here since the
beginning you have put in the work uh if you have continue to show up

and then we gotta play a little bit of party music five second warning thank you
[Music] put in the work showed up it should be immensely proud

01:15

struggling with media queries to to building the salon website and adding

01:16
some stuff to your Baseline portfolio to learning the big foreign JavaScript
learning what the heck functions are variables are Loops conditionals and
learning a programming language from scratch
to taking that knowledge and starting to build real stuff
real stuff that should be on your portfolio to this day to getting into
apis and getting data back from NASA could you can you just think about this
for a second billions of years of evolution led to
humans humans then built out computers those computers then
helped you learn how to code and somebody else along that timeline built
a a big old camera that took a photo of something deep in the galaxy and you

01:17
wrote code that took that photo and showed it up on a screen what is this
like what is that to to then taking that JavaScript and
understanding that the things that we thought were JavaScript like the Dom not
JavaScript set interval set timeout not JavaScript to learning about node in the
back end to using that skills to build out
back-end applications to to learning how
to handle our views with ejs to learning
how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works and and adding documents
and then learning MVC and building out bigger and bigger applications building
full stack web applications together learning how to learn with Dr Barbara
Oakley to getting clients contributing to open

01:18
source to to learning data structures and algorithms a touch of react to
coming to stand up to giving your nights and weekends to learn folks
you're special other individuals won't do those things they'll say they want it
but they don't want to do the work all the all the nightmares all those long
nights all that hard reading those hard videos the stuff that didn't make sense
Leon why'd you say it like that I need to go get me some Mine Wolf to explain
it better you stuck through it stuck through it you managed your frustration
you did it you met the first thing I told you to do is manage your frustration

01:19
stayed consistent you got your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done
and I hope you took care of yourself along the way because you're still here
that's how I know you did it because the folks that didn't last listen to that
last piece they're not here anymore taking care of yourself is is an equal
part of this process and as you go into the hunt
as you go into what I think is the most difficult part of this process I hope
you don't forget those three things manage your frustration be consistent
and take care of yourself those three things got you to this point
they got you to graduating and they're gonna carry you through the hunt

01:20
ERS hat did everyone see Brendan's hat is amazing
if you haven't followed them on Twitter you're missing out
all right congratulations everybody really well deserved
all right uh so what's next well uh we're gonna have a virtual party uh it's
about finding the right platform for it so probably uh right before the holidays
or maybe right after uh we're gonna have a virtual party where we can hopefully
hang out with each other um commiserate spend some some
well-earned time together just hanging out and partying we're gonna do a little
bit of that tonight but I want a slightly better platform that might be
open to more folks and then uh blah has been trying to plan for a very long time
uh a West Coast Meetup so we're gonna make it happen uh we're gonna do a West
Coast Meetup and then we're gonna talk about 100 maintainers because I would
love to see a bunch of other local meetups
um happen where folks come together and we're gonna help try and facilitate that

01:21
so folks that have been uh going through this experience might be able to see
some of you in like real life so that's something we're going to start
trying to facilitate just to to say hello to see each other so that's coming
you deserve to to celebrate your your victories uh together so we'll do a
virtual party and then we're gonna also try and help facilitate some meetups
um to to to so folks can can celebrate together
so that leads us into what's next and there's a couple big things I want to
talk about about what's next and the first thing is that hunts Tober or
huntsgiving continues uh so every single day we are doing stand-up or a t-spill
that's going to go throughout into the holidays and probably a little bit after
I really want you all to have more experience with data structures and
algorithms and that's just a little bit of daily practice that we can do to to
learn all that also it's a place for you all to ask

01:22
questions that you're running to on the actual hunt you got an offer how do you
negotiate uh you got an interview what should you prepare all this stuff that
keeps coming up uh we want a space for you to be able to get that help and
support literally every single day and so that's going to continue for the
foreseeable future all right hey there you go that's awesome
um we also are still finishing up the first wave so the first wave of all the
uh hunttober stuff is still happening touring is still happening the letters
the verifications and stuff like that are still going out and now that I have
a little bit more time we'll be able to get those things uh hopefully done
within uh the next week so that'll go out very soon and then we'll send out
messages for wave two uh so give me about another week week and a half for
wave one and then we'll figure out wave two and then we'll figure out how to do

01:23
something for um the rest of the community can you please accept people into
LinkedIn group uh they've been accepted make sure you have a lot of folks that
say Hey Leon I have a photo and a description don't actually have a photo
and description pull up your profile on a like separate window like an incognito
window and make sure you have those two things uh if you do you get at it
cool so all those goodness still continues uh wave one finishing up wave
two will be soon and we'll keep going uh we also have a
few more classes that I want to get through uh postgres testing agile
methodology uh I probably won't be the only person doing these we'll probably
have guests that'll be joining me to work through these things there's no
hard date for any of this stuff it's just as I find the right folks from the
community that want to help me work through it that's what we're going to do
um so we're going to get to these and a few other things I think are important

01:24
to just be on the top of your brain and then I need a lot of help like
a lot of help um folks keep asking about a third cohort and
there is no way a third cohort happens without help from the community
and so I've had this idea for a little while called a hundred maintainers and
over the next few weeks we're going to be sharing more basically next week's
surveys will be going out for feedback and stuff like that and then also just
me trying to recruit folks for a hundred
maintainers folks that feel passionately about what we are doing has an impact
and could change literally the trajectory of some folks lives and their careers
I want folks that are committed to that mission committed to

01:25
the idea of what we built here is special and wants to see it grow and
there are so many things that I want to have someone take charge of
from our YouTube from our social media from our website
to our documentation for each class like
there's so many projects that get put on the back burner that if we had someone
that wanted to step up rise up to the challenge and
own and then be supported by the community be supported by myself and
blah and the rest of the moderator team um that's that's the future right the
future is us coming together to build hands down
the best experience possible and so on that form will be a lot of things that I

01:26
think we need but I am open to whatever you think would improve the next cohort
if you are serious about owning it and making it the best it can be so I really
want someone to make sure that our help channels are the best that they can be I
want to make sure that as I am building out the the um
the platform for our jobs right like I want to like we have the job board
that's launching relatively soon I want somebody that wants to own the
relationships with the companies that go on the job board I want somebody that
owns the relationships with the folks that we bring on as guests to our
streams like there's so many things that we could be doing and firing and off
cylinders if folks from this community wanted to do it and so when folks asked

01:27
me when is the next when is the next cohort I don't know if we can figure out
all these things and support not just a thousand people but ten thousand people
a hundred thousand people going through a program like this that gets me excited
right that gets me excited how can we support we went from 300 right to to
thousands how do we go to ten thousands and that is a scope beyond me
right that's a scope Beyond me and so if we're really Community taught
we need to build out those systems that help the entire community
and that's what I think 100 maintainers should be and so maintainers are from
open source communities so uh and open source communities you have a
maintainer somebody that owns that part of the project
and that's what I want for 100 devs I want somebody that wants to own that
part of the project that gets all the Laurels that gets all the wins that uh

01:28
can proudly say hey I handle this at 100 devs
um and that's what we're looking for and so we'll be sharing a forum next
week uh that you can sign up if you'd like to sign up and that will have a place
um to share what you think you would want to handle if it's not on that list and
so that's 100 maintainers we I already had so many folks that have come out and
said they want to do this and so it's going to take us a while things are
going to not be great in the beginning we're going to find ways to build out
consistent documentation to build out consistent process nobody has done this
at scale nobody has done this where they have 40 plus thousand people on a
Discord thousands of plus people in each class and so there will be speed bumps
but I think together we can build something that really works well for the
next cohort of 100 deaths and so that's if you want to that's one

01:29
thing I really want to focus on for the next cohort then my baby
the thing that I have won it since the beginning is the agency
and so the agency site will be going live uh it's not done
so PR's are welcome once the site goes live this weekend uh hand to God it is
going live uh and it will not be good and so PRS are welcome
books that want to add documentation that want to add things that help folks
learn more about 100 devs will be live and that'll be just the start
the long-term goal is for individuals as they are learning to have the ability

01:30
to complete pull requests and get paid if you don't want to do that and you
just want the traditional 100 devs experience that's okay
that's absolutely fine with me um but not everyone has that privilege
and I do not want to continue to build systems that do not work for everyone
it is great that so many of us have the luxury and privilege of time to work on
this stuff unpaid not everyone has that privilege and so
for folks that need a way to fund the time that they're investing as they are
learning that's where the agency comes into play uh I already have
some companies that want to work with us but think about the power right
think about the power of what our community brings to an organization that

01:31
hires our agency right think about it it's not just development
it's beta testers it's QA it's maybe initial customers it's promotion it's
thousands of likes and retweets before they even freaking launch
unique Minds exactly bringing ideas to their to their product right
it's something that no other agency could provide and we have the means to
do it and so my long-term vision is that someone comes to the agency the project
gets broken down into digestible pull requests or sorry digestible issues and
as you complete pull requests you get paid a portion of what funds came into
the agency and if you don't want to do that part that's okay if you do you now

01:32
have a means of getting paid while you go through program and you also have
Real World Experience on your portfolio when you graduate on your resume you can
put the real clients that you've worked for so I pushed you all to do it
independently and now I would love to help you do it not independently but
through the agency and so this will be a hard-fought victory this will be
something that's going to take a long time it's going to be a lot of hard work
it's gonna be something that delays the next cohort until we figure it out but
it's the next thing I'm setting my mind to and it's what I think is the only way
to continue equitably equitably free is not free for everyone and
I think this is one of the solutions now there's a lot of stuff we got to figure
out I'll be hosting kind of like weekly calls on on everything that I think that
I'm putting into this asking for help to build it out everything will be done in
the open completely open books completely open budgets every contract

01:33
everything will be in the open so when somebody comes to the agency that's what
they're signing up for um because that's also a big mystery to
a lot of folks like how do I do actual contracts how do I um
how do I talk to clients how do I build real products well what
if every single person that was building the product was also streaming it right
and so there's there's there's an idea here that I think it's going to take
some time to figure out but I think it could be a huge differentiator for folks
that really need it now the first thing you're saying is
Leon wait a minute setting up an agency incorporating lawyers
contracts figuring out payroll all of this stuff costs a lot of money why not

01:34
be a non-profit well if I started a non-profit
the donations would come from y'all the donations would come from you and
that defeats the whole goddamn point of me not wanting you to have to pay any
money I know the moment that we start a non-profit you were all paying money to
that non-profit that defeats the entire point of
everything I've done over these last two years
it also causes a lot of really hard red tape
that means that a lot of bigger Brands can't just work with us so uh the way
that we fund 100 devs going into the future is through the agency and
everything will be open all the books will be open all the work will be open
and that's the way we make it sustainable not only for us but for
everyone that comes through that needs the means to support themselves as they

01:35
go through program now starting all this costs a lot of money
setting up an agency incorporating uh getting real good lawyers in place to
make sure I'm doing everything and not
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything up getting real bookkeepers all this stuff in place
costs significant money like actual investment to get this done and so
you're saying Leon well how are you going to get this off the ground well
I would like to introduce our first sponsor of many raid Shadow Legends
it's not a meme they're literally sponsoring us
yeah it's not a joke they're they're literally giving us money so that we can
build out the agency uh so next week I will be playing a raid Shadow Legends
oh it's dream and they're gonna pay us enough money that I can hire like

01:36
lawyers and stuff to to build the agency uh but only if you all show up
uh this has been a dream of mine since the beginning this moment right here is
what I did everything for I've always wanted to be able to say
that we were sponsored by raid Shadow Legends uh just for the the meme of it
but it's true it really happened they're they're sponsoring our community
and so next week I'll be playing raid on stream
uh for each person that signs up with our code we get even more money for the
agency and uh for each person that makes it to level 25 it's a
completely free game for each person that makes it the level 25 uh they
actually get free merch so not only did I figure out a way to fund the agency

01:37
but there's also a way for you to get free merch and the merch actually says
don't sign up yet we got you got to use the code or else we don't get any money
all right that I'll release the code next week when we do everything
um but yeah so if you shine up with our our link that directly funds the agency
uh it'll all be open I'll show you how much money is coming in all that stuff
and then the folks that make it to level 25 uh I
believe I'm trying to negotiate more but
it's the first 100. can't make this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up folks the first 100 folks to make it to level 25 uh will get custom merch
that says 100 devs investor on it you can join the boardroom
you can come join the boardroom the people that make it the level 25

01:38
will get a mug or a tote bag that says 100 devs with our logo and then investor
because you invested in starting the agency uh by playing raid Shadow Legends
uh so I this is like this is so fun I love this
so I'm out here grinding y'all I'm out here grinding I'm taking all the
sponsorships we're gonna get this agency off the ground and I'm super happy uh
that raid Shadow Legends is sponsoring us uh so that'll be next week come
through hang out when I share the link if you sign up with the link uh the more
people that sign with the link the more money the agency gets and then uh the
first hundred folks that make it to level 25 each person that makes it level
25 makes us more money for the agency and then the first hundred folks that
reach level 25 get a mug or tote bag that says 100 devs investor on it so I
hope that you join us next week as we lay the groundwork

01:39
for our community and building out the agency
tell me this was all I love this this is like this is the I've always wanted to
do this let's go all right now before we spend some time together this evening
one last push you all are phenomenal software Engineers was it a joke no it
wasn't a joke this is dead serious I am dead serious
because look look it's everything that we want right it's everything we want
raid is completely free to play you can play it not only on your desktop you can
also play it on your mobile phone it runs on freaking toasters
that's perfect I will never like I hellofresh factor all these other

01:40
companies want to work with us because our community is so strong I say no to
those sponsors because it would cost you money to get those things
right like if I took a hello fresh sponsor
that is telling don't stop spamming it because it's not gonna um I don't want
people to sign up now we need to sign up with our link right
if I took a hello fresh sponsorship right and
I made stuff on stream that's asking you all to then go and buy something I will
never take those sponsorships right but raid is completely free
you can play it on a toaster and if you get to level 25

01:41
you get free stuff like what can't beat that all right now
one last push before we spend some time together tonight you are all phenomenal
software engineers you all have done things that other folks cannot do
or won't do you have given up nights weekends Untold number of hours
you have ridden the roller coaster through highs and lows you have trudged

01:42
through the trough of Sorrow you've gotten lost in the muck but you kept moving
forward and so I want you to be immensely proud of the work that you put in
the work that you will continue to do knowledge in our brains
is the only [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing people can't take from us
and whether you've been here for one class or 69 you now have things
that others do not know things that folks cannot take from you
things that will put food on the table things that can unlock a career it'll

01:43
change yours your families and those around you's lives forever
a lot of you are at the end of the trough of Sorrow
you're at that point that I showed you the dip that goes even deeper the dip
where it feels like you can't continue it feels like rejection after rejection
and that stuff can eat at you more than any other part of this process

01:44
and so all I ask is that you don't give up and when you are in that low
and you are close go in The Struggle Bus Channel
tell us what's happening tell us what's going on so that we can live up
to being Community taught that we can help those that are at the breaking point
and help pull them forward and if you have made it through those Wiggles of
false hope and you are completing your hunt
or you're a little earlier and you just haven't gotten there yet when you see
somebody at that point please live out to being Community taught and help folks
through those lows and into the job you are a phenomenal software engineer

01:45
you are built different you have done things that others cannot do or won't do
you deserve the things that are coming your way you deserve to have a wonderful
career you deserve have a wonderful life that can be afforded to you because of
that career I hope you remember all the folks that are in this chat right now
