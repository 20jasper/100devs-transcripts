some reviewing we got to to answer some questions good weekend what's going on
all right you know how we do we like folks to get in here give them a second
they're running home from work to get in
here a couple things that we always like to do at the beginning one we got a
question of the day folks question of the day is would you
rather would you rather paint a wall with your face or with your knees

00:05
whole wall normal we're talking like a normal like a normal bedroom wall
i always love seeing how split it is i always love see how split it is
this one this one's like 50 50. i say like half of people are saying face
about the other half we're saying knees i don't know i feel like
i feel like there is any precision work involved my face might be better i don't
know i think i can i feel like i can do i can do this with my forehead all day
right whereas my knees i don't know i feel like my knees might
after a while you can't you can't hit all the crevices
right i don't know i feel like i feel like my forehead can put it my forehead
can put this on work right i feel like i can uh i can use my core a little bit
more i don't know if i can keep bending my knees like that all day
i'm gonna go with i'm gonna go a face i would rather paint a wall with my face
than my knees oh boy well we're in for a good one
today folks uh a topic that i love dearly which is responsiveness making

00:06
our sites look great across devices we hinted at it on thursday's class and
tonight we're going to go deeper into it we're going to talk about how things
how our sites can be made responsive so they look great across devices how we
can look good on mobile desktop laptop tablet and everything in between we're
going to talk about the big three when it comes to responsiveness fluidity
elasticity and content decisions we're going to get some practice in and then
this and next class is just all about responsiveness building responsive
websites and then on thursday we got a lot of practice to get into
with responsive sites so super excited tonight we're also going to do our first
steps into talking about how to network i love talking about this it's the thing
that's going to help you get a job and so we're going to spend a big chunk of
maybe the first hour tonight talking about how to network how to find people
to network how to do it properly and then on thursday

00:07
on thursday i'm going to give you like actual scripts like i'm going to give
you like the text you can send i'm going to give you the paragraphs you can send
so we're going to talk about it in theory tonight and then on thursday i'm
going to give you like the actual things i would send to people because a lot of
folks sometimes get really nervously i don't want to say i don't know how to
send it i'm going to give it to y'all folks don't have to worry about it i got
you got you we don't get caught we go get all right folks um
let me bring up the slides we always like to start off with questions right
all these thoughtful questions it started to start our days off give us a
second to get in here what questions you got for me folks bangers only exactly
whoo got my lovely got my lovely uh cold brew today
that's what i'm drinking my lovely cold brew i'm doing good i'm doing real good

00:08
did i get a chance to play a new pokemon game yet didn't get a chance in there
people were real set up there was no motivation today
i didn't put a motivational poem or video in there
and people people were people had some words we'll bring them back on thursday
when we start the job search once we get through javascript and we're feeling
comfortable we'll start laying the groundwork for the job search but we
don't really take the job search seriously until we're full stack
software engineers until we're full stack web developers right we we want to
have the front end and the back end to open us up to as much possibility but
actually that's a great question to ask because the groundwork for you getting a
job starts tonight right the groundwork for you getting a
job honestly starts tonight the things that we do to build our
network are the things are going to help you get a job right
so it's a really interesting question like we won't take it seriously until

00:09
much further but actually it kind of starts tonight
are we actually assigned to watch independence day yes that is your
homework your homework is to watch independence day it will have a lot of
strong bearing right strong bearing on our next couple of
classes and so you must watch independence day you have to it's the homework
plenty of places to find independence day to watch online for free
the movie yes exactly it'll make sense trust me you just gotta watch it i
i didn't see who said it but that was the right question the the the movie or
the crap version uh there is only one independence day they did not make a
sequel they did not make another one it does not exist so of course will smith
independence day only independence day there just doesn't exist another version

00:10
so yeah what if we know it by heart already go back and watch it again
the classic they made a sequel exactly exactly you feeling me i see you
do you have any trouble drinking or sleeping after cold brew uh no
i could drink coffee uh 20 minutes before i go to bed and it will have no
bearing on my sleep because i take serious medication to help me fall
asleep i'm bipolar so i take my bipolar medication and that that zonks me i i
could literally i don't know i could do anything and it just
there's just no staying up i just get zonked so yeah there's there
it doesn't matter what i do throughout the day
and i've been keeping really good track of like my quality of sleep um i wear
like that watch i showed the other day so i can see like if i'm waking up or

00:11
not and there's there's nothing that impacts it that medication boop i'm out
yeah i i i actually like i love like i'm on seroquel i love seroquel it's like
literally changed my life it stops me from having manic episodes helps me
sleep i don't have it my life is in shambles so as much as it is a is a hard
hard drug to get used to i really did change my life um but the first couple
times i took it i remember the first time i took it and then we're going to
start with class i promise once one story then we'll get started with class
the very first time i took it i was with my family um
i was with my family to go see thomas the tank engine and there was like a
real train that had a thomas the tank engine on the front and my um my cousins
like were really in the thomas tank engine so like the whole family went and
there's gonna be this big ass train with thomas the tank on the front and it's
like a whole thing to do and i just remember i took it the night before and

00:12
i'm just sitting there like this i'm like sitting like on the i'm like
sitting on the bench just like tongue out like i'm probably drooling on myself i
just was not there i was just out i was out
and i was like i didn't even know i was doing it
uh so yeah that was my first experience of circle but your body gets used to it
after a while and uh yeah it changed my life
i wouldn't be able to do anything that i honestly am able to do
if i wasn't on like a regular bipolar medication so for all the folks out
there that are that are bipolar and they're worried about like the taking
new meds like with your doctor's approval give them a chance i went
through three or four different medications until i found what worked
and then the one that did work felt like death for the first week but after that
it's good it's good all right let's get into it folks tonight we got

00:13
how to network part one right this is part one of like four
classes we'll have where networking comes up right so the first part starts
tonight we're gonna talk high level right what to do how to do it why it's
important none of it's really a requirement until we get into next week
so i don't want you to run out and think you have to start networking this week
that's okay you don't have to we're going to start talking about tonight and
then on thursday i'm going to give you every example that i have what's the
email i send what's the linkedin message i send what are the twitter messages i
send right i don't want you to like guess what that looks like i'm going to
give it all to you right i'm going to review some of our cs fundamentals
including specificity and the box model we're gonna review some of the floating
examples that we actually went over on sunday as well uh we're going to review
those three simple layouts we did two of them on sunday but we're gonna do one
tonight just as some some space repetition we're gonna
talk about the basics of responsiveness like fluidity elasticity content

00:14
decisions and how we can build sites that incorporate those ideas and then
the last thing at the very end we're going to cover a little bit of
flexbox so i want to show you we've been
dealing with floats we're going to float some more tonight your homework even
going into next week will be with floats
but i want to show you the magic that is flexbox
and how it can really just change your life once you kind of get past floats
right and so we're going to talk about flexbox tonight i'm going to show you
one example and why it's so powerful and
then as we get into like next week we'll start using it more alrighty
already got through some questions remember folks uh please check in
you can do exclamation point check in here in chat but that's going to get
spammed out to wazoo it's always on the discord follow along
materials channel and the lyrically on live so you always have
that link before class or if you just already follow me on twitter i'll tweet
it always an hour before class starts so you can always go ahead and check in
i appreciate it helps folks find the community

00:15
and not have to pay so much to learn how to code
the other thing is today is the last day for the study community survey we
released a survey last week asking folks to fill in their preferences for study
communities after tonight myself and the mods are
going to work very very hard to get all those communities live on discord to get
all the voice channels set up all the individual channels set up and so uh
tonight is the last night uh for you to fill out that form if there's a
community that you would like to belong to uh please make sure you fill out that
form so we can build out the community starting today and then we're gonna
start adding folks to them as soon as possible alrighty
i wanted to start off with the big congratulations i've known about it for
a little while uh but they officially just put into the the celebrations

00:16
channel so i'm putting them on blast here a little bit uh huge congrats to occ
uh they go by old coderchick on twitch they are an illustrious member of the
hundred dev stream team they're a mod extraordinaire and they
just announced that they are now employed as a full-time software
engineer and so they put the link into the celebrations channel highly
recommend checking out the celebration challenge while there's all these folks
getting jobs and now it was jennifer's a turn and so super happy for them
congratulations this is huge and the message that they
shared that's on the screen right now i want you to read i'm not going to read
it through because it's here but i think there's a little bit something for
everyone in this message a lot of folks that have concerns um
about things that they think might hold them back in the job search uh jennifer
went through it through them a lot and a lot and all of them and so to see them

00:17
be so successful and to to lock it down and to see their journey has been just
absolutely amazing to watch and so definitely show them some love in the
celebrations channel i put the direct link to their to their message but uh
shout out to you occ congratulations all right submitting homework
there's none due today so uh don't you don't have to stress
some people were panicking where do i submit stuff uh there's nothing that was
due today and so there's nothing to submit uh you'll have stuff that starts
getting somebody on thursday and next week we're gonna have a lot of homework
i have a lot of homework all right next thing um we are
well first let's start off with a huge thank you
uh for all the all the folks that are new uh all the things that get
like all the subs and bits that gets put
as a donation to the nonprofit i work at during the day called resilient coders

00:18
and last year we donated thousands of dollars and i wanted to kind of be very
transparent about this process because we're getting into some territory that's
like very very serious money um when i told you all last class that if
you have amazon prime you actually get a free sub
uh you can spend all of jeff bezos's money uh it's actually just completely
free if you have amazon prime well you all kind of went wild and uh
we're over we're at 2200 subs 2200 subs now twitch gets half of that
but that's that's a lot of money going straight into our
emergency fund at resilient coders to help with mental health support
to help with folks that run into emergencies throughout the cohort and i
i'd like i'm just besides i just want to say thank you from the top of my heart
from the bottom of my heart any part in the heart in between
i really do appreciate everyone for doing it now i want to start releasing a

00:19
transparency report every quarter that shows you like how much came in and that
i actually made those donations uh last year we made the
donations and once he got into real money i was like wait i gotta pause i
gotta make sure that i'm doing it right uh so when my taxes get filed i'll
release that first transparency report with kind of all the money that came in
um what we had to withhold for taxes and then like what what went to rc and then
my goal is to do that quarterly right so every quarter um we'll go ahead and
release that as well and so we just want to make sure that folks
know that like eventually like we'll release all that stuff and like i'll
share it with you all because it's getting real
but i gotta make sure i'm doing it right and i gotta make sure that like i'm not
double paying on taxes or weird stuff like that and so uh once that all gets
filed i'll release the first big one and then the goal should be every quarter
will release like a new updated one so once again huge huge thank you um

00:20
never ever ever ever please i'm gonna get big here for a second never ever
ever feel like that you must sub or that
you have to sub or something that i even want you to do it's honestly not i want
this to be a completely free experience for everyone none of my content will
ever be behind a pay wall nothing i will ever do will
cost you something in any way shape or form in terms of money uh and so don't
ever feel like you have to do that a lot of folks feel like that they want to
support specifically when i start uh support rc and so they do choose to sub
and i appreciate you for doing that folks that use the amazon prime which is
completely free like thank you i appreciate that we're putting it to good
use and so i want to say a huge thank you um i want to say a huge thank you
um it's kind of getting a little overwhelmed right now some people are
throwing them in here thank you for the five gifted subs i couldn't see who did
it um but thank you so much everyone i really really really appreciate it cool

00:21
let's put out there alrighty now we have grown from
a humble 5 000 folks on discord to i believe the last one looked 23 000.
uh 23 000 people are on that discord now and uh i said it before
i'm gonna say it again please before you write anything here on twitch
before you write anything on discord ask yourself one very important thing
is that the most helpful the most supportive the the the the most
pleasant thing you can type in that moment and if the answer is no do not

00:22
type it i have no patients or folks that can't be decent i will not
lose sleep over banning you i just don't care if you can't be a good human being
please leave and if being kind uh if being decent giving people the
benefit of the doubt um understanding that folks come in with things that they
don't know things that they're not going to know perfectly well or that they're
going to need help and they might need help on the same topic 10 different
times leave i don't want you here i don't care that
you're here please just leave and i'm very serious about this right like if
you can't be decent please leave uh if you're if you're if
you're here to find a significant other you're in the wrong place if you're here
to find someone to date you're in the wrong place if you're here to find love
you're probably in the wrong place unless you love your friends a lot right
so please cut it out not necessary does not need to be here

00:23
um this is a place to learn this is the place to get stuff done
and if you can't be nice you will be banned drock you long
thank you so much for the five gifted subs i appreciate you
all right cool so i send my piece and i'm gonna keep saying it again uh
because some people don't get it um and one thing you have to understand
is that everyone might not have your expert taste in let's say memes
right you might you might have the the freshest taste in memes
but your memes might be hurtful to others uh so please
make sure before you share anything whether it's a meme whether it's a gif
whether it is a piece of text that you're holding yourself to would this
make an a comfortable environment for everyone that sees it if it's not a
comfortable environment for every single
person that will see what you're posting please don't post it

00:24
right and if you don't know the gray areas then you should probably just
stick to the help channels right if you if you don't know how to
how to how to regulate in that area that's fine just don't post just stop
this goal is for us to have a safe comfortable learning environment for all
and if you can't commit to that type of environment
get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out please just leave please please please please
return to the z a thank you for the 10 gift itself that's wild
all right i've said my piece now sometimes you're going to maybe
not live up to the the things i've just asked you to live up to
and you will be banned and if you are banned we actually now have an unbanned
process uh in chat here you can do exclamation
point on band that'll give you the link uh but the link is always just the bitly

00:25
slash 100 devs unban okay you can submit an unban request and
myself and the moderators will review them hopefully every week
sometimes we might be busy it might take
us more than a week but the idea is that
it will happen and we will review review why you were banned we'll tell you more
about why you were banned if you request it
and then we can make a final decision as
to whether or not you're welcome back in the community
there are some things that folks get banned for that might be out of their
control right sometimes people like clicked on those nitro links
please do not click on free nitro links they're they're just not they're just
not real no one's giving you free nitro please stop clicking those links
and it's not even just on our server you click on those links right
you click on those links and another server they have your account right and
so then once they have your account they will go ahead and start spamming in
every server that you're on so some folks have gotten banned because of spam

00:26
right we don't want them to not participate in the community we want
them to be able to get unbanned and so here's the unbanned request to do that
all right don't get got exactly so if you were banned and you would like
to appeal your ban this is the link to do it uh myself and the moderators will
review them uh weekly and uh hopefully weekly and get back to you uh you will
always get communicated via email so we won't dm you we won't message you
here on twitch moderators will never reach out to you
on discord or twitch it'll always come through email
it'll be bans at 100devs.org that you'll see the the email come from and we're
only going to communicate with you through email uh please
do not reach out to individual moderators to get unbanned
no individual moderator or even myself will unban you
it always goes to our committee of moderators who will review it and then

00:27
unban you if you reach out to individual moderators you reach out to me
and you ask to be unbanned you're going to get a
very scripted message from all of us and that scripted message will say
please fill out this form right please fill out this form if you continue to
message individual moderators or myself the ban will stand and then we're just
going to block you entirely okay so please
you can't be a decent human being don't join the server don't type anything if
you do get banned here's the process to get unbanned
all right and please understand that myself
individual moderators are not going to unban you it has to go through this form
and we'll go to our committee we'll review it and then we will unban you
this being said we've only had to ban very very few people like
we're talking like a handful right that's the beauty of this community is
that we have amazing people in this community

00:28
that are doing amazing things and it's only been a handful of bands so far um
so i really really appreciate you all creating a space where folks feel
comfortable uh where folks can come to get work done where they can learn and
grow together and that doesn't happen with me it doesn't happen with the mods
it happens with y'all right you are creating that space and so thank you
thank you thank you oh boy now we got all that out the way uh
let's talk about networking folks let's talk about some networking now
here's something that you will have heard from me that i will say
time and time again just applying to jobs will not get you a job i say again
applying to jobs will not get you a job wait a minute what did he say
applying to jobs won't get me a job yes that is correct

00:29
just clicking apply or even filling out a normal application will not get you a
job there are some folks online that you see
some folks that have talked to me leon i've applied to 400 places i haven't
gotten a single interview let alone a job and my response to you is that
you've messed up clicking apply does not get you a job
if you click apply that is worse than printing out your resume
all right if you if you're going to click apply
might as well print out your resume crumble it up and throw it out the window
right might as well throw it uh you might as
well go ahead crumble it up and throw it out the window and here's why
here's why when you throw your resume out the window

00:30
right when you throw your resume out the window there's a chance
that an eagle flies by right there is a chance that an eagle flies by
when that eagle flies by right they pick up the resume that you
threw out the window and they're pissed you're like they're you're a littering
person right they're pissed that eagle's piss eagle picks up
that that that resume and flies to the local police station and the eagle drops
the the resume into that officer's lap right and the officer thanks the trained
eagle right the officer thanks the trained eagle right for bringing this litter
and they open it up and they see that it's your resume
and so they get in their police car they come to your house
right and they they they arrest you for littering

00:31
and while they're arresting you they they see that you have
html up on the screen and they go oh you write code my cousin works at such
and such place and they write code um you know what
we're gonna spare you this time and uh we're not gonna arrest you
anymore but you're gonna you're gonna meet with my cousin that writes code
and uh the the police officer gives you the cousin's phone number because
they've been trying to hire right and so you talk to that cousin and that cousin
uh says hey we saw that you wrote good html my my cousin saw it when they were
arresting you uh we would love to give you an interview right second chances
right you got caught by the the litter carrying eagle we want to give you a
second chance uh and come interview with us and then you interview and then you
get the job that whole story is way more likely to happen than you
getting a job by clicking apply it's a legit story folks

00:32
and it's way way way more believable um way more believable
than uh you clicking apply and getting a job okay
that that that's way way more believable let that sink in for a second i'm gonna
i'm just gonna let it you know let that linger for a second
way way way more believable okay so with that being said the thing
that will get you a job is your network and so
what we're going to ask you to start doing next week is to start your networking
and i think there's a lot of i don't know there's a lot of anxiety
around networking there's a lot of things that people maybe people just
haven't done it before they maybe they haven't built the professional network

00:33
before we're going to talk about all that stuff we're going to make sure that
you feel comfortable networking that you find the things that work for you and
that you can do it at an appropriate pace no matter who you are or kind of um
barring some serious concerns uh you can find something that works for you
right uh folks that have extreme anxiety there's things that might be more that
work might work better for you the folks that um aren't really extroverted there
might be things that work for you and so we're going to talk about a lot of them
tonight and places that you need to start exploring but the one thing i need
you to do is to start exploring right start figuring out what does and doesn't
work for you so that you can do this networking okay now here is
what happens with networking starting next week i need you to
connect with three individuals that are already in tech
okay three new individuals that are already in tech

00:34
and i need you to have two coffee chats with individuals that are already in
tech okay so the idea here is that you're gonna
meet three people that are already in tech they don't necessarily have to be
software engineers although that is the goal but people that are already in tech
project managers designers people that work at companies that would employ
software engineers right you need to find three and connect with
three of them each week then you wanna have two more right two more
all right two more that you sit down and have a longer form conversation with
now why do i ask you to do this so when we look at the boot camp that i
run during the day called resilient coders it's actually more than this we
asked folks to find five people right five people and then
three coffee chats let that sink in the students that do my boot camp during the

00:35
day they have five a week plus three coffee chats now the reason why
this is important and why we have them do five a week and three coffee chats
it's because by the time they're done the 20 week program they have over a
hundred people that have met them that know them and could eventually be a
referral for them right you need to do the same
thing this is where every other boot camp [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
this is where every other tutorial that
has tried to teach you how to code [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
they like to pretend that the coding or the skills is the thing that gets you
jobs it is absolutely not every every coding tutorial every boot camp right
should be 20 weeks of how to build your network
and at the very end they should say go do free code camper the odin project
every single tutorial that's what it should be

00:36
networking for 20 weeks and then go do free code camp or or the odin project
that's what it should be right and so if for some reason the gifted subs aren't
coming through sorry i see folks are doing gifts itself
but i'm just not seeing them come up on my um screen i think they're
uh behind a little bit so i apologize if you give gifts to subs i appreciate to
get the subs i just i just can't see them coming at the second right that's it
right that's what it should be and so what i hope for you is that after tonight
it's a little less scary right it's a little less scary and it's a little bit
more clear how you're actually going to do this
because i see a lot of you some people are saying uh i live in the middle of
nowhere all right i got you uh i i'm introverted i got you i have anxiety i

00:37
got you we're gonna talk about all of this stuff tonight so that you can start
chipping away at those i'm gonna say i don't like to say it but keeping with
those excuses right some folks have some real real things
that will get in the way of the networking but i don't live somewhere uh
i'm introverted i i have like mild anxiety not really like like
nothing real but like a lot of anxiety right if you have anxiety that you can
still overcome because some people don't right but if
you have the privilege of not having cripplings crippling anxiety if you have
the privilege of connecting to the internet uh you have the means to meet
with folks around the world right you have the right now is the best time ever
right the best time ever to network in the history of networking there has
never ever ever ever been a better time than right now

00:38
right i don't care where you're from how you do or what you do it right
this is the best time there has ever been the network everything is remote
everything is remote if you live in the middle of nowhere guess what you can
network with the best of them right and so this this right now
is the best time in the history of time to network
and so we got to use that to our advantage we have to use that to our
advantage right my students back in the day and by back
in the day i mean like a year or two ago when they wanted to network they would
go to a meet-up they would have to leave the classroom they'd have to get on the
subway they would have to go all the way to meet up they would get to that
meet-up there'd be two people there they
would go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then they would get
back walk back to the to the subway get back on the subway go to a different
meetup get there there was five people at that one but they already knew all
them they go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then they get back

00:39
on the subway they go to a different meetup right
you don't have to do that anymore everything's remote right now if you
don't like where you're at close your eyes
if you don't like the meetup that you're
at click x get out go to the next one it will literally never ever be better
to network than it is right now now let me say this again
networking can be a very scary thing for a lot of folks
there are tips strategies tools techniques we're going to talk about
over the next couple of classes that'll hopefully be helpful
when i'm giving this advice i am not talking to the people that
are going to need serious kind of outside help right there
are some of us that don't have the privilege of
being able to do this properly some folks really do have crippling anxiety
that stops them from networking some folks really do

00:40
have things mental health things that might stop them from doing this part of
the process so all the advice i'm giving to you right now is is not targeted
directly at those individuals if that's where you are the thing i have to say to
you and the thing that that has helped most of my students is you have to get a
game plan together with a therapist and a psychologist right this is coming from
someone that that has bipolar disorder that has impacted my life to the point
where i couldn't do networking the only thing that got me out of that hole was
therapy and a great psychiatrist right and so
i want to put that on the table right i want to put that on the table because
i'm going to say a lot of things that i just don't want to have to exclude those
individuals but if that's what you're facing you have to work through it it
really is that important right now will there ever be
somebody that doesn't have to do this networking process yes there are ways if
you clicked apply there are things that can tip the odds in your favor right but

00:41
what i'm talking about is a process that is going to tip the scales
more in your favor than it is just clicking apply so if you know
that you are working with a therapist you're working with a psychiatrist to
get over the things that would stop you from networking that's fine these next
couple things we're going to talk about over the next couple classes they aren't
for you you have to find strategies working with those the mental health
professionals that will enable you to apply and get over that hurdle okay
so to put that preface but if we do have the privilege of not struggling with
those things this is for you okay um i ask that if you do kind of
struggle with these things we have the mental health channel and i will do a
session i think just for folks that are in that camp that'll talk through the
things that i had to do to hopefully help me get over my mental
health hurdles to to be able to start networking
and i think we'll do like a smaller session that's not like public on twitch
to help kind of address some of those concerns but

00:42
barring that issue right this is for you now
the other thing i'll say is that i would say probably the bulk of you think you
can't do this right and barring the things that we just talked about you can
you might not like it right you might not like it
you might kind of hate it at first um but you can do it right you can do it
uh and the cool thing is we're gonna do it together
and when you go to a lot of these meetups in these places uh there's gonna
be a lot of 100 devs folks there i have to be really careful the things
that i share for you to do because what's going to wind up happening is
there's going to be a thousand of us at those things but i have had students
that you would think had every barrier against them that found the strategies
that worked for them to help them the network and what i'm going to say i'm
going to say it from the mountaintops the thing that gets you a job is the

00:43
networking right it is not the learning to code it is not
the getting the best at javascript it's this right here
individuals that do this better will get more jobs than the folks that can code
twice is better twice as good all right a lot of caveats throughout there
but i'm excited to talk about this stuff so starting next week you owe me three
connections and two coffee chats at first the coffee chats and the
connections they can be the same people but as we get further in and we kind of
ease into this right we ease into this right
as we ease into it uh you are going to eventually have three connections and
two coffee chats that are separate but we start next week you're not starting
this week we start next week you're gonna have all week to try this and the
first week's not gonna matter i just want you to try so next week

00:44
you're gonna try right you're gonna try you're gonna get used to it and we're
gonna build it up right you're gonna get better you're gonna get better you're
gonna get better and it's something that is a muscle just like learning the code
is the muscle that we had to get this networking thing is something that we
have to get better at and something you get better at over time
your first couple networking sessions are going to be awkward as hell you're
going to be nervous you're going to be anxious you're not going to know what to
say um but you're going to get better at okay
all right let's talk a bit more about this people really stress out over the
networking but what the heck do i mean by networking the goal of networking
right the goal of networking is to turn a stranger
into a co-worker but the first step in that is turning a stranger into a friend

00:45
right right the goal of networking is to turn a stranger into a friend
and so this is the the steps that it should go through you meet a stranger
they become an acquaintance and then they become a friend
when someone is a friend right which someone is a friend they
will most likely give you a referral and that referral can be used to get an
interview or to get some perks during the interview process and eventually
that friend can become a co-worker now here's the thing
this process can take a short amount of time to take a long amount of time but
that's the goal the goal of networking is to make friends there's nothing more
to it than making friends now the reason why it's important for us
to make friends and to get referrals is because most companies
if you get referred you get some magical things that happen

00:46
when you get referred to a job often you'll skip a first round interview
when you get referred to a job often you might go right to a technical right you
might go right to whatever that first round is you might skip right
now the other thing that's really interesting right now is that a lot of
companies pay referral bonuses so they'll pay engineers i've seen
anywhere from like a couple thousand dollars to 20 plus thousand dollars per
referral so if a company is paying their engineers 20 000 per referral
and you can't get a referral that kind of says a lot and so this idea of
referrals is really dominant right now in tech
these referrals mean a lot internally it
gets your resume to the top of the stack
it gets you an actual interview and once
you have a referral there's like another

00:47
step two is that you can have a champion if someone's your friend and they
actually really want to refer you they're going to make sure that you get
the interview a lot of these jobs will have hundreds
of people that apply and they don't even
ever get don't even get somebody to look right they don't even get someone to
look at their resume right that company gets hundreds of applications and then
the people that they wind up interviewing are the folks that just had
referrals anyway right so the idea here daddy yankee says my referral bonus is
5k exactly right um daddy yankee was uh nick from our
alumni chat on friday right so if if they're paying nick 5k
and you can't get a referral from nick then there's something there's something
going on there right and so we want to build our network to get a bunch of
folks in our corner that will eventually
give us a referral because that referral does so much for you it skips rounds of

00:48
interviews and it gets your application actually seen right so that's why the
referrals are so powerful so when you're doing this networking the
goal is to meet a stranger turn that stranger into an acquaintance
and then ultimately a friend and then when the time is right you can go back
to that friend and say hey i see that you work at chow now can you give me a
referral right now here's where people do it wrong right now nick just said
that they have a referral bonus they said on friday to message them and
what people do is this they go blah i'm going to reach out to nick
yo yo yo i need a referral like they just they just in mass they
just vomit sorry i don't like i said i stopped saying it and they they got they
they they just they just blast nick with messages right they just blasting with
messages there's there's no there's no rhyme or reason to it it's all about them

00:49
right it's all about them right it's all about them right they
don't care about nick they want the referral they want nick to to give them
the referral they just don't care they don't take the time to get to know
them and make them a friend so is nick going to ever refer you the person that
just randomly adds them on twitter the person that just randomly adds them on
linkedin are they ever go are they ever ever going to get the referral from them
no are they eventually going to have hundreds of people reaching out to them yes
so the the thing here that the other thing too i hate the most is linkedin
some of you go on linkedin and they're like every single every single person
that you ever see on linkedin you add right you just add you add them to
linkedin you're just doing this all day yes yes yes oh yes just linkedin
linkedin linkedin linkedin linkedin linkedin linkedin right and then what
you wind up with is yeah you have a thousand people that you're

00:50
connected with on linkedin but none of them know you none of them care about
you and none of them would give you a referral
you're better off purging your entire linkedin and only having people that
you've actually met and interact with if you haven't met and interact with
that person linkedin is is not the move like it's just you're just
you're just you're just clicking and it's never going to get you the referral
because people don't care about you right so you're doing it wrong and so
when people say leon i've applied to 400
places my question to them is always who did you talk to at those 400 places and
the answer is always no one so that means you never got a referral
and your resume never made it to the person that could actually care about it
so stop spamming people right stop spamming them adding them on on linkedin

00:51
when you've never interacted with them they're never going to do anything for
you right they're not going to do anything for you and now you just have a what
could be an amazing tool of the people you know and interact with is now wasted
on connections that aren't real right and so just be careful
with these tools right the whole goal of networking is to make friends if you're
not making friends you're doing the networking piece wrong because the end
of the day we want to have people that we can rely on that know you that can
give you referrals or can connect you with the right people at certain companies
is that the same as twitter yes if you're using twitter for networking and
you're just like mass adding people that you've never
even like liked one of their tweets i don't know that doesn't seem really
helpful to me i think twitter is definitely different
because like you're you want to like it's not it's not just networking right

00:52
it's like it's like connecting and like seeing
other posts and stuff like that but linkedin is very much about like getting
a job so your linkedin should be manicured it should be perfect
right it should be like your real network all right
so now you're like leon you're telling me that i need to make friends right leon
friends make friends how how do you make these friends right well
we're going to talk about how to make friends
uh we're going to talk about how to make friends and we're going to talk about
how do you like talk to people i i know for some folks it can seem
silly but i guarantee you it's not for most folks most folks
aren't comfortable making friends and most folks might not know how to start
these conversations that's okay if that's the camp that you're in i got you

00:53
all right and so the place i always recommend folks to start with this
is how to win friends and english people
if there is one book that has changed my life more than any other book
it is this book here how to win friends and influence people okay now
how to win friends and influence people is a collection of ideas
and stories that will lead you to be able to make friends and have meaningful
interactions with others you can find the book online for free very easily
and there's also lots of summaries of all the key points what i've linked to
here is a summary of all the of all the key points so i recommend reading the
book because there's more to it that you
don't get in the summaries that help the the idea stick
but this is where you start that's the foundation if you say to yourself leon i
don't know how to talk to people i don't know how to make friends

00:54
great i was in the same place this is how you do it it's this book so
start there and then once you start there you have to practice it this is where
most folks this is where most folks stop remember
they were talking about trough of sorrow this is where it's where it comes in
right hey zeus so dejesus is one of the best people i've ever seen on this topic
and they just said that that book helped
me a lot so dejesus has a wonderful blog post that i've linked to you all before
don't seek mentors seek friends right like um
they're they're well versed on this topic and they're telling you right now
this book helped them a lot so start here if you don't know how to make
friends you don't know how to carry conversations start with this book
i'm going to start synthesizing some of the things from that book into our next
couple lectures on um on how to how to win friends and
influence people but how to network so you're gonna simply start seeing me fuse

00:55
some of this in there but this is where you start cool
so now you're like all right leon i have to turn strangers into friends got it
i don't know how to make friends but i'm gonna read this book got it
how do i meet the people that are strangers so i can turn them into friends
got you all right got you one of the best ways
to turn strangers into friends where you don't have to do anything at all you
don't do anything other than show up right
you don't do anything other than show up is to go to meetups or events
and specifically events that reoccur right that happen once a month

00:56
right and so here's what happens if you were to go to a meet-up once a month
by month three you are seeing the same people
right you've seen the same people over and over again right over and over again
and just the idea of having seen that person
three times in a row that person is now an acquaintance
if all you ever did was say hey i'm leon nice to meet you bob and then the next
two times you say hey bob hey bob guess what you're an acquaintance [Music]
right get you some all right you did it that's all you have

00:57
to do introduce yourself to someone and then say hello to them two more times
and they're an acquaintance they will recognize you maybe not the first one at
least the second time they'll recognize you
and one of the things in the how to win friends and influence people is this
this term that you'll actually hear everywhere now it's that the the word
that sounds the sweetest in any language is that person's name right so just by
acknowledging them saying hello with their name three times in a row
they now now you're an acquaintance at least right
you keep showing up those acquaintances it will naturally grow if you just be
are intentional of saying hello what someone's name you can move from from
from from kind of that stranger to acquaintance very quickly now these events
most of them are virtual right now right and so you're saying leon how do i how

00:58
do i get that rapport going if it's virtual well a lot of these virtual
meetups have breakout sessions right where you will kind of like hear like a
little bit of a talk and then they'll put you on a breakout session with other
people right so you can still get that you can still get that rapport building
you can still go from that stranger to acquaintance even if you're going to all
virtual events it will still happen cool the other thing too is that
for most folks being local is a competitive advantage
now if you live in the middle of nowhere or you live in a country that does not
have a tech scene uh this advice is is true but you're going to work a
little bit differently at the at this part right so meetups are wonderful
local meetups are even better okay now the beautiful thing right now this
being the best time ever to network ever is that if it's remote

00:59
there's nothing stopping you from networking in that area what is the closest
city with the most jobs think about that what is the closest city with the most
jobs if you are in the middle of nowhere how close are you to chicago how like
what like where where are you close enough to that has tech jobs guess what
that's where you're gonna network that's it
that is where you're gonna network a lot of these meetups are still remote
so since the remote pick a city and start networking even if you're four
or five hours away even if you're a whole country away pick one city to
focus on right pick one city to focus on and start going to all the virtual
meetups there right like i said this is the best time
ever to start the networking and so you can find um meetups that are remote

01:00
local will always be a competitive advantage if you can can get in good with
a local area and you can meet all the people in that area and you do this
networking every week right by the end right at the at the end of a hundred
at the end of a hundred devs you're gonna have like a hundred people that
you've networked in that area the odds of those hundred people knowing
the person that you are interviewing with is pretty high right
right it's pretty high if you put in this work now when it comes time to
start interviewing that 100 that you spent time on
it 10x's it's really a thousand that you can be connected to and interact with
right it's not just right it's not just the people that you
networked with if you made if you turn them from a stranger into an
acquaintance or friend you now have their friends that you can be connected to

01:01
right and so it it 10 x's at least the more you put into it so being local
is a competitive advantage picking one place to networking can be a competitive
advantage even if you don't live in that area pick somewhere first right even if
you know leon i want to be remote pick a place to start practicing with right
pick a place even if you want to be remote pick a place
right won't this process be overwhelming yes
this is a very overwhelming process at first but here's the thing
you get better at it it gets easier the first couple meetups you go to are going
to probably not go really well if you're not like a naturally like talkative
person right but it does get i promise you i've seen
hundreds of my students go to their first networking events kind of just
stand in the corner and go home but eventually you get better at it you get
a little bit more comfortable with it you practice it and the beautiful thing

01:02
is if you're going remote you could be middle of a conversation
right you could be middle of a conversation hey my name is leon how you doing
i i uh and they'll never see you again they'll just never see you again right
that's the beauty of being remote if it you could be mid-sentence you could be
mid-sense and if you feel uncomfortable click x get out of there who cares this
is the best time ever to try networking right best time ever to try networking
cool so i like to start off with meetups i'm going to cover this topic just one
for a few more seconds then we're going to take a break
i like to start with meetups particularly local meetups and

01:03
meetup.com is an amazing site to find these meetups but every city has their own
has their own job like their own boards that where these events get posted
right and so meetup.com is an amazing place to find meetups but there are so
many other places that you can find them um so in boston
like here's something that we we share with our folks in boston these are all
the places that we could go in boston to find events we got the guide to boston
boston tech and startup events the epicenter community
different universities calendars right like there's uh
tech ladies like she geeks out there are all these places that we can go to to
find events that are just not um they're not just meetup.com and so one
of your first things you have to do is when you pick your like locale
you gotta find all the places that the events get posted to in that locale

01:04
right and one of the things you might do at your first couple meetups is saying
hey like i really like this meetup what other meetups do you go to like what
other ones are like your favorites and then you find even more right so at
first i'm going to look like there's a handful there's a couple but then
eventually you start to find like oh there are all these other ones that
aren't just necessarily on meetup.com the other ones that people can start
inviting you to and so it grows but even if you want to be remote pick a
location start local find local meetups even if
they're like they're probably going to be remote right now right and you start
there that's the first place that i recommend they start finding people that
you can turn from strangers into friends the idea behind the local events or the
recurring events is that it's very easy to go from stranger to acquaintance when
you know you're going to see the same person over and over again all right
let's stop here with the top of the hour we're going to take a break
when we come back from the break we're going to start talking about other
things that aren't necessarily events where you can find people to turn from

01:05
strangers into friends all right folks if you're new around here we like to
take breaks the top of the hour we're here to be we're here to be healthy to
be in this for the long haul the five minutes on the clock here alrighty folks

01:06

01:08

01:09
enjoy the five minutes hydrate get some babies and i'll see you all in five um
leon we made friends while you're gone love it
well they were just like spamming where they're from i love it
should we have business cards for in-person events ah that's up to you

01:10
people still carry them we just ask for people's emails
all right folks about 20 seconds left some people are asking about like a
bunch of different places and apps and stuff like that we're gonna get there
we're gonna talk about a lot of all the other places too so
we'll get there in a second all right folks come on back come on
back hope you had a good break alrighty folks cool

01:11
let's jump back into it welcome back come on back come on back
is it okay if it's any tech event for example if it's event talking about
python yeah i go i go to all of them i go to a bunch of different events
um it's whatever i'm interested in right i think like i've like gave talks at
like certain meetups like the css meetup and stuff like that in boston uh so i
have like the ones i like to go to regularly um
but yeah i think in the beginning more is better because you'll find you'll
find like they're like not every meetup's the same
some really suck like people that show up to them just aren't the best or like
they're too small or they're too big like you're gonna you're gonna find your
recurring ones right and your recurring meetups are different for every person
and you kind of just have to throw yourself into them in the beginning you know
do you have a tip on how you cope when you feel overwhelmed um i think in the
beginning it's just giving yourself like time right
when when i say these events like some people want to run out and do like 100
events don't be selective in the beginning take some

01:12
time get get get into it exactly breathe like find your footing like this is not
something that you're going to get perfect next week this is something that
you're going to do for the entire cohort to get better at this right so don't
think that people come out the gate hot and are really good at networking
they don't it takes a while and it takes a while to be yourself it takes a while
to get comfortable right what if there are no meet-ups in your
country pick a city doesn't it doesn't have to be your country the beautiful
thing about being a remote pick a different city a city that you might
want to work in remotely even yeah find your groove exactly you'll
find your groove and it takes a little while right give yourself we always say
give yourself a little bit of grace right and you'll find your groove and
and it'll it'll get easier time but you can't use it as an excuse not to start
it's the only way that you do get to the
point where you're comfortable where you do get to the point where you can make
friends where you get to the point to where it actually has a meaningful

01:13
impact on your career is if you start yeah
cool all right so we talked about like events particularly like local events
meetup groups events that are recurring these are often the best for my students
just because it really does have that built-in mechanism to go from like
stranger to acquaintance very quickly so that's why i like the recurring events
remember meetup.com is a great place to start but often the cities that you're
targeting will have dozens of other boards or other places
where they share events and you got to seek them out you got to give it a good
old google you're the old 100 devs try and start finding these locations
all right the next big thing is conferences
the reason why i really like conferences is because
they bring together large amounts of people and the people that show up the
conferences want to network like most of the time
people are showing up to conferences because they want to meet other people

01:14
that are interested in the thing that they're interested in right and so the
beautiful thing about going to a conference is i've made so many friends
by going to conferences because we're all there because we care about one
topic and we're all kind of more open to meeting new folks and so for me
conferences have hands down in the number one place that i've made friends
in tech right conferences are hands down the number
one place i've made friends in tech i go to a lot of conferences each year
that's kind of chilled a little bit during the pandemic but conference has
always been the biggest for me and the way that i find conferences are
you just you put in your interest right and then the word conference after in
google right you can literally put javascript conference and you'll see
some stuff that pops up um you could even tie it closer to like where you are
like javascript conference boston and things will come up right and so you try
to find like a bunch of these conferences there are listings online of
like all the biggest conferences as well and so you could find all of them

01:15
under devscon soon maybe i don't know let's see i think let's talk about it
right but these conferences are great uh and
here's here's some some things about conferences um a lot of them are free
a lot of them are not but almost always there is a way to get
into a conference for free i hate recommending things that are not free
and so when i say conferences even the most expensive conferences there's
typically a way in where you don't have to pay any money and it might actually
work out better for you and so what i'll
often do is if there's a conference that costs a lot
send them an email hey i would really like to attend this conference uh i'm a
newer i'm an entry level software engineer
and i'm broke as a joke right i'm broke as a joke
is there any way that i i could get into the conference at a discounted cost or
potentially for free right 95 of the time they're gonna give you a weigh-in

01:16
right like 95 percent of the time they're gonna give you a weigh-in right
um i i see some people saying like sneak in i think i think sneaking in like i
mean do you right but there are often ways to like do it legitimately that'll
get you in the door like 95 of the time and so send them a message hey like i
have no money like is there a way for me to attend this conference and they'll
typically say yes like 95 percent of time they'll say yes the thing that has
helped me the most and i actually have my shirt on today um is volunteering uh
i volunteer every year at two or three conferences like without
skipping a beat like every year pandemic has stopped this obviously but
two to three conferences every single year i volunteer at
when you volunteer you often like have to like do one thing and then you get to
spend the rest of the time at the conference right like um i volunteer at
the free software foundation conference every year um and typically like you can
you can schedule like to to be in charge of like

01:17
one thing that you'll miss like one talk
but then the rest of the time you can do whatever the heck you want uh you get a
free t-shirt right like and you get to meet all the other volunteers so like
it's like it's automatically like a little group of people if you don't know
anyone right if you don't know anyone that you
immediately are now like oh here are like the other folks that are
volunteering and so you immediately have
like this small group of friends already that are at the uh at the conference so
i volunteer at libre planet every year it's my one of my favorite conferences
to go to it's a free software uh conference and free meaning that like
like open source things like that not like free money um
and so the the place that i've made like i have like very like
i would say one of my closest friends are from volunteering at conferences uh
i use when i volunteer at libra plan i love to do the the the gift shop like
where you can come and like buy t-shirts and hats and stuff like that and

01:18
literally one of my best friends right now is someone that i volunteered with
a bunch of times at that gift shop where we would just sit there and shoot the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for hours um just us because people were like in
talks or something like that and so volunteering is a great way to get into
these conferences for free to meet a small group of folks and um and to
to to like get that ball rolling but the beautiful thing about conferences is
that it does bring a bunch of people together that are
interested in one topic and often are really open to meeting new folks
one of the things i always tell folks if
you're going to go to a conference never
ever eat alone also another really great book but don't ever eat alone right
if you are going to go to lunch and you see a group of people hey are
you going to lunch do you mind if i tag along right sometimes they'll have like
discord channels or like an irc channel beforehand and i'll
be i'll just type in there hey i'm going to go get lunch at one o'clock anybody

01:19
want to join me for lunch and somebody will always say yes right we'll always
say yes and so it takes a little bit more effort to like to to reach out hey
slum dog i wonder i hope i want some dog just donated 25 bucks uh thank you for
the donation first of all and if you're the slumdog that i think that's on
twitch congratulations uh on your job yeah congrats thank you for the donation
and congrats on the job is that you and jen thank you for the hydration cool
so don't ever read alone um it's just an easy way to connect with folks
and that like you you share a meal with someone that goes from stranger to
acquaintance very quickly so yes it does take a little bit of a little bit of
your your extroverted juice to like tag onto a group or to put yourself out
there in that way um but there are a lot of ways

01:20
that you can maybe meet up with those groups and good conferences actually
have like channels specifically for like meeting
up to eat with people so conferences great place to meet people volunteer
figure a way to get in for free and um never eat alone it'll be super easy to
meet a lot of folks if you do those things
and like i said your first one kind of sucks you kind of feel awkward you don't
really know what to do right but you can figure it out and the cool
thing is if you're going to conferences now
i bet you there are some other 100 devs folks that are going to conferences
and so we have an event channel that will open up
a little bit more as we get further along in the course
uh rock bottom hey thank you for the five gifted subs um we'll open up that
adventure channel more as we get deeper into the course but i guarantee if
you're going to conferences there will be other 100 devs folks there that you
can say hello to that forms your first little group and then you can bring in

01:21
other folks to your group right and so um when there are big conferences coming
up we'll share them on discord so that you can know to like meet up with folks
that are already there so that way you'll always have like your first
little bit of friends um and then you meet others the biggest bit of advice i
have ever given to folks that feel uncomfortable
networking at meetups or conferences is to don't don't do it alone always have a
buddy right have a buddy and so when my students go to meet-ups or they go to
conferences they bring a buddy don't bring lots of don't don't go in
groups because if you're a big group people are going to feel
like they just won't approach you but if it's just you and somebody else you can
walk up to any other person and you become a group of three and you both
network with that person and so as the big conferences come up we'll
open threads for like buddy groups and stuff like that but yeah cool
the other big thing is community groups and this is where folks that might not

01:22
like going to conferences or meetups can really shine uh by community groups i
often mean like local meetups or text channels so discord slack irc
there is often groups that you can join that might only be completely like text
based and so if you have a hard time meeting folks like face to face and talking
these text-based arenas might be for you and so i i think
de jesus was here earlier they're like the best person i've ever seen at this
right they they they just were on discord all the time in
other discord communities where they they labeled themselves i forget exactly
what it was it was like um still here what was your name again nick it was like
i forget what you called it like impatient developer or something like that

01:23
terrible developer [Laughter] their their name and discord communities
was terrible developer and they just put that out there and
people would like actually help them and they would giggle when they saw their
name right so they got people started to recognize them just because of their
name that they were always posting right and then after a year i got better and
the community promoted you to inconvenient developers so yeah the
community kind of rallied around this idea that somebody labeled themselves
teller world developer uh then they gave them inconvenient
developer right and so these text communities can be just as equally
beneficial as like face-to-face communities you build a rapport with
people they get to know you they see you consistently and so find a community
group that works for you right our discord is a great source of community
because we're all going through it together but if you're networking you're
going to need something else that's not just us right

01:24
and so there are tons of like discords that you can meet in tons of slack
channels tons of other text-based communities and then
even just like local communities that you can join uh in boston we have a
chapter of a civic hacking group it's called what's the the main um code
some code for america yeah code for america and then code for america has
chapters in pretty much every single city right and so
you can join a local chapter of code for america and that's a group of people
that come together just to build and hack on stuff they're technically kind
of like volunteering but it's like a group people that come together to like
build so it's not even just like traditional like networking but there
are places where you can come and write code and get to see the same people week
after week writing code together and those are often the best because not
only do they know you but they also know your coding ability right and so

01:25
look for community groups there are also like interests or affinity groups too
one of the big ones is tequila for folks that are latinx there are so many
communities that if you identify a certain way then you could join those
communities too and you got to start seeking these out now
you got to be seeking out your meet-ups you got to be seeking out your
conferences you got to be seeking out your community groups so you can start
kind of having multiple angles to attack meetups are going to dry up
conferences are going to drop community groups are going to dry up you got to do
all of these things to kind of constantly build that that that way of
reaching out and connecting with people and you're going to find one
that you enjoy more than others and that
might become your group that you go back to where you really make those friends
those deeper connections and it's about putting yourself out there into all
these different angles to find what works for you personally like what like
what clicks in your brain and what gives you the best fruit right cool
community groups and then there are apps

01:26
i don't know where this image comes from but when i search for apps this is the
photo that comes up right uh there are apps and i'm i gotta
be careful what apps we we share uh because we're gonna take them all
down so i i i put big ones here but there are so
many other apps that can help you network as well but these two are like
the bigger ones and so i feel comfortable putting those but maybe not
the smaller ones right and so the apps like lunch club or bumble biz
are ways that you can just like swipe through and meet people
i haven't had too much success with them but some of my students really this is
like their main way of meeting people and so if conferences aren't working out
local meetups aren't working out community groups aren't working out also
try the apps right maybe that's a little bit less pressure for you
maybe it's a little bit easier to meet folks and the other thing i'll put is
like just be careful um some people are on bumble biz not to make like

01:27
colleagues but other things so my general disclaimer don't be creepy and
be careful folks that are creepy on these platforms
but apps can also be another great way for you to meet people
and then the one of the last ones here right one of the last ones here is is to
talk to your friends and family and let them know that you're a software
engineer once you tell friends and family that
you're a software engineer you'll be surprised of like who your friends and
family connect you to right you'll be surprised you never know
like who they know and so once they know they might share it with others
a lot of your freelancing stuff when we get there will come from friends and
family and so the more you let folks know hey this is what i do this is how i
do it and i'm looking to meet other folks uh you'll you'll you'll probably
start to hear other folks too that they're somebody's friend or brother or
cousin or something and then those connections can be really really strong

01:28
right if there's somebody that connects you with somebody else that can be
really strong and this this counts for folks that you
networked in too right so once somebody goes from stranger to friend you could
say hey bob i really enjoyed getting to know you
you seem really connected in the tech space is there anybody else i should
talk to and i had a student before that whenever they had a coffee chat they
they ended every single coffee chat with who should i talk to
right who should i talk to and every week they got their next coffee chat by
asking the one the week before who's the
next person i should talk to and can you connect me right
and so you can do that too right like once you kind of put in that work to get
the um the connection you keep moving juggling biohazard says how do we get
over the feeling of being disingenuous or manipulative
it's only manipulative if you're not actually trying to make friends
if you actually go into this honestly like wanting to make friends and get to

01:29
know people then there's nothing disingenuous about
that like yeah your goal is to like build a network so you can you can like
get more jobs right but like daisy said like be genuine yeah
like actually care about the person you're talking to provide value right
like provide value i think that's one of the things that people get wrong with
networking so much and some of the things we're going to talk about on
thursday um there's too much to cover in just one class right and so on thursday
we're going to talk about like how do you like actually talk to these people
like what are the leon show me the messages that you're sending show me the
conversations that you're having because i i've never done this before i need to
see what you're talking about we're going to do that on thursday right
but be genuine right what do we do with our hands be
genuine care about other people provide somebody value right if you talk to
someone and your goal is to make friends actually listen like if you were if you

01:30
had a coffee chat with me this week right there's like a 99 chance that
it's gonna come up that i did not play the new pokemon game you're like hey
like how are you doing how was your week
how was your weekend like typically when you start off a conversation with
somebody you say hello hey how's your day been how'd your weekend been going i
would have said hey i was too busy i didn't get to play my the new pokemon
game that came out i was really looking forward to it right
if you wanted to provide me value after that call and show me that you were
listening show me that you were um like engaged i would expect an email
saying hey leon i really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me today i
learned like i just had so much fun like engaging with you have you seen this
article about the new pokemon game that's it
you provided the smallest a bit of value just by linking me an article and that
in my brain right makes me think positively about you so there are these
things that you can do in these talks and there are things that we can do

01:31
after the conversations that get people to go from stranger to friends right so
let's talk about that process alrighty you meet someone
right you meet them at an event a conference a local community group right
you meet someone the next day you should send them an email in that email right
in that email you need to provide some sort of value
and that value should indicate to them that you were actually like engaged in
that conversation hey bob it was amazing to meet you

01:32
i really enjoyed our talk about rubix cubes did you see
that the competitive speed cube is now less than 10
on amazon i it blew my mind i had no idea right i had no idea that it could be
that cheap to get into rubik's cubing thank you for for letting me know
like thank you for like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thank you
for bringing up rubik's cubing again i'm
going to order one and get into it right so that just provided a little bit of
value i showed them that they can get a new rubik's cube for under 10
and it shows that i now have an interest in a passion of theirs right it really
is just that simple sam said if i had two hours a day
to commit to furthering my career 30 of those 30 minutes of those would be
networking 100 agree right so you meet them next day you follow up with an
email provide the smallest amount of value it can be linking an article could
be linking something that that tied into a passion right three days later

01:33
add them on linkedin alright three days later add them on linkedin
hey we met at the such-and-such meetup a
week ago or three days ago a couple days ago don't say three days that sounds
weird hey we met up uh we met at the meetup a
couple days ago i really enjoyed talking to you i had a lot of fun i would love
just to stay in touch so i'm adding you here on linkedin hopefully i see you at
the next meetup right now notice i didn't just add them on
linkedin what did i do i didn't just add them on linkedin what did i do
i sent them a message for the love of all that is holy everybody right now
right hands up please right hands up in the air please yes you you're not
putting your hand put your hand up if you're able please okay repeat after me

01:34
i promise you say you say i promise i promise to never
add someone on linkedin ever again without also sending a message
or say one more time for the folks in back i promise
to never add someone on linkedin again without also including a message
all right well we all promised if you ever add me on linkedin
let's just get real here for a second uh if you i don't i don't accept people
on linkedin until they graduate just by the way
um but if you ever add me on linkedin and there's not a message
i'm blocking you and i'm banning you from everything you're gonna be banned
on twitch you're gonna be banned on on discord uh

01:35
your anything that i i'm gonna block you on twitter right
any any way that i can i can never see you again i'm gonna figure out a way to
do it all right you're gonna you're gonna submit your
ban appeal and it's gonna be a all right my camera did not like the
putting the hand up there we go all right we're back cool
we've all agreed we've all signed the sacred oath to never send a linkedin
message uh say send a linkedin ad without a message ever again cool
i'm gonna ban you on vine exactly what if we sent the request a month ago
you're all you're right all right then six days on the sixth day right on the
sixth day you add them on twitter all right so you met someone the next
day you sent them an email that provided some value
on the third day you added them on linkedin with a message reminding them

01:36
where you met them and thanking them again for their time
and then on the sixth day you added them on twitter
what are we doing right here folks what are we doing to these people's brains
right now yeah we're stalking no it's not stalking it's networking okay
we're doing spaced repetition we're doing space repetition on them
remembering who you are right and we're doing it with enough
space in between that it's not weird it's networking right
we provided value we provided appreciation it's not weird as
networking right and we just spaced repetition the brains into remembering
who you are so the next time you go to that meetup you're no longer a stranger
what are you you're no longer a stranger what are you

01:37
you're at least an acquaintance you're at least an acquaintance how good
are you are at this process maybe you're a friend right but you're at least an
acquaintance right you're leasing acquaintance so in
in one meet up you can turn quite a few folks from strangers to acquaintances
just by following this pattern now if you're like leon
i don't know what email to send leon i don't know what linkedin message
to send ah i don't know how to add them on twitter i got you
thursday i got you thursday i'm going to share
exactly what i send in an email i'm going to share exactly what i send in a
linkedin message i'm going to send exactly what i send on twitter i got you
right it's going to be you could don't copy and paste because there's like a
thousand of you copy and pasting it but it'll give you the good idea all right

01:38
memphis thank you for the hydration cheers to you cool now coffee chats
let's say you've done this previous pattern you met them you emailed them you
linkedin them you twittered them right you feel like you're at that
acquaintance stage right the coffee chats always be
different people they should you should try yeah all right
different people each week at least right the idea is to have a coffee chat now
coffee chat used to be like in person like you would go to a
coffee shop you would sit down and you would talk with the person
uh right now not everyone can do that a lot of people are still not meeting up
in person right so when i say coffee chat i mean just talking with someone
one-on-one now some people like to do pub chats right
like where you go to like a you get beer
right some people don't some people like coffee something like that right

01:39
it doesn't matter where you do it or how you do it it's it's the idea of sitting
down and having a deeper conversation with somebody one-on-one now
to get that coffee chat what you would want to do is say send them an email hey
i really appreciate getting to know you i thought a lot about the conversation
we had a week ago i it seems like you're at in your career
where i want to be in the next couple of years like in 10 years from now right
would you be open to giving me 15 20 minutes of your time just to have a
deeper conversation about how you got to where you are right now right
and you send them that email if they don't respond
two weeks later you send a follow-up hey i know times are busy i just wanted to
ping you again to see if you'd be open to meeting for a quick coffee chat
and then if they don't respond to that at the end of the month you send them
you send them one more email if at the end of the month after three months they
don't respond to you then you just drop it right don't keep badgering them you
tried you shot your shot they don't want to meet up that's okay

01:40
you're gonna have a lot of people that you shoot your shot they just don't meet
up they don't have time they don't respond that's okay right but i
guarantee you a lot of people in tech had had coffee chats
when they started out that helped them with their careers and so they want to
have coffee chats with you because they were where you were right in boston
i have n i i've never turned down a coffee chat
i've never turned down a coffee chat and i think i've only gotten like no's like
i don't even i don't even i know it had to have happened at least once
but i i can't remember somebody saying no to a coffee chat right
that's just that's just how ingrained in tech this idea is
right that people know that like engineers work together they they need
code from each other that like they build their careers that way right and so
this idea is that like most people will be happy to have a

01:41
coffee chat with you a lot of people would want to share their experience
with you because that's how they got to where they are now now
the thing you have to realize is that you should be doing this locally right um
because you're you're going to be like there will be a lot of people are going
to be asking for coffee chats soon and so make sure you're trying to do this
like locally first and then other people out um
a lot of people don't a lot of people get confused about the coffee chat like
should i buy them coffee like if you're gonna meet in person here's my trick
if you're gonna meet in person right and you're gonna actually go to like an
actual coffee shop here's my trick go early right go early and buy the smallest
coffee they have right if you have some money buy the smallest coffee they have
right it could be a shot of espresso i don't care what it is tall coffee
whatever it is whatever the cheapest freaking thing on the menu is you get
there early order that and you sit down with it right

01:42
now when the person you're meeting with comes you can say hey i already got
myself a coffee well if you want to grab something feel free to grab something
and then join me right so now there's no there's no need to like buy them a
coffee they don't feel awkward having to buy you a coffee right and if you can't
afford the the small coffee just ask for a cup of water
right most places will be yeah sure here's a cup of water you'll sit down
with the water you wait for them to come in they'll see that the other person
goes to get coffee and then that's it you're good right if you're really cheap
like like if you really want to be like like like save money just keep the cup
next time you show up right next time you show up you sit down and you already
have your cup you can reuse that cup right you can reuse that cup for like
your next five coffee chats that's it you just bring the cup put on

01:43
the table and you just wait all right that's it
i should say frugal not cheap you're very frugal right that's what you do you
just bring the same cup you're good all right [Laughter]
all righty but like i said most of your coffee chats right now
right most of your coffee chats right now are probably going to be remote
they're probably going to be like google
call like google meets or zoom calls and that's okay most people aren't meeting
like in person yet all right now the the last
well i got two big more things and we're going to move on i promise um two two
two more big things that i want to talk about uh that i think are really helpful
when it comes to networking one is using the sheet

01:44
so here is the sheet uh you can do exclamation point sheet in chat um but
the links here in the slides and the sheet uh the sheet has
just a place to keep your networking okay it's a place to keep your networking
and so due to a large number of people currently viewing the spreadsheet access
may become limited or not possible i've never seen that before or not possible
what you're going to do is you're going to make a copy of this sheet right
don't worry about it right now you're probably going to come after class
you're going to make a copy of this sheet okay you make a copy of this sheet
and in it you're gonna keep track of each person that you network with right
you keep track of each person you network with you're gonna add the event
that you met them at the date their name where they work what they do
and most importantly the spark the spark is like the thing that you

01:45
remember about that person right right that's the thing that you remember about
the person that way you never forget like the thing that you talked about
right like they really like pokemon they
really like rubik's cubes they they hate poker i don't know right you put it you
put the spark on there so you never forget you put their email on here
and then you have the uh kind of the three steps right
did you follow up with email if yes mark it off
did you add them on linkedin if yes market remember with a message right
if so mark it off right and did you add them on twitter so mark it off right and
so over time you're going to have this amazing list of people that you've
networked with that when it comes time when it comes time to start kind of
reaching out right to start reaching out to folks to get referrals this is where
you start hey bob we met at such and such event last year

01:46
i remember us talking deeply about rubix cubes i really enjoyed our conversation
i'm currently looking for new roles are there is there anything out there that
you feel like might be a good fit for me here's my the stuff that i like here's
my resume boom right so those people that you forged those
relationships with over the entire boot camp you now have a nice clean list to
go back to with everything that you remember about that person and that's it
it's how you get the jobs right cool there's also this other part of it
called the hit list we're not there yet eventually when we go on the hunt to get
our job this other part of the sheet becomes really important but for now
please keep track of the folks you network with you'll never remember
everything you'll never remember the spark you won't remember where when you
met them you put it all here so you don't ever forget it cool now
you're turning strangers into friends you found the networking places that

01:47
work well for you you're you're setting up your your coffee chats you're using
the sheet you're doing everything you need to do to be networking well
there's one more pro move i'm a pro gamer this is my pro gamer move you ready
alerts alerts folks so you can on google right set up custom alerts so it's just
google.com alerts and when you go here you can create an alert about anything
you can add each person that you met and create a google alert about that
person's name now whenever whenever i don't know what that is whenever
whenever you show i guess that was my all my alerts

01:48
for my name popping up whenever you me go back there whenever you
type in someone's name and something comes up about them you will get an email
and it will say hey leon noel just showed up in this article right
if there is something that they talked about
right they're really into i don't know pokemon you could create an alert for it
now the next time you talk to that person you can bring something up
oh did you just see of this new news about x y or z or
if you want to reach back out to someone right you want to reach back out to
someone right and like you want to reach out to them to get it like you want to
get a referral hey bob i just saw that your company raised uh

01:49
100 million dollars huge congrats i hope some of that money
is going your way i hope that like you're you're hiring like wild and if
you are i'm looking for a new opportunity uh let me know if there if
you if you know of anything that's open that you think it might be a good fit
for hope you're doing really well hope you're enjoying the new pokemon game
have a wonderful rest of your week right it's going to be you're in if you ever
need to follow up with somebody again because you're going to have all these
alerts that you build up over time the other thing too is that you could
like add their companies blogs like an rss feed or their blog to an rss feed um
so the idea is just to like create alerts for anybody
anybody that you put on this networking sheet you create an alert for that's it
so many people get concerned about like genuine interest
here's how you don't worry about that be a good human

01:50
provide more value than you take right and actually care about the
relationship that's it if you do those things you are fine
right these are just ways that you can bring them back to your top of your mind
right and this is how the world works folks
nobody's ever told you this this is how you get jobs it's how you get better
jobs this is how you get the the big jobs right has nothing to do with how
good you are at writing code has to do with folks wanting you on their team
that's it all right we can go home all right buddy have a good rest all right
so on thursday we are going to um do more review of these like ideas of how

01:51
to network but we're also going to give examples like i said of everything
so we're going to keep doing this it's not something that you're going to start
tonight it's not something you're going to start this week so we're going to
start next week after we've had more time to talk about it and we've seen
more examples but before we jump into it i wanted to answer some questions
how do we follow up on coffee chats the same way that you follow up on any other
follow-up i send them an email the day after saying thanking them for their
time and providing some sort of value in that email
pick something that you talked about right
take something you talk about and then put that into the email providing some
sort of value what are some important questions to ask during coffee chats
there are no important questions you're there to make a friend you're there to
get to know someone right and if you read how to win friends and influence

01:52
people one of the things they talk about is people love to talk about themselves
so if you don't know like if you're not great at carrying conversations just get
the person talking about themselves oh where do you work at do you like it
how long have you worked there how did you get into tech did you go to school
for computer science did you learn on your own oh what languages do you use oh
did you use those languages beforehand did you have to teach yourself what are
you excited about with those languages what are you excited about for your job
is there something like you could just have those like basic
questions asking them about themselves and how they got there and that'll carry
you for the entire coffee chat that's it can i use board game events or local
events besides meetups yeah you can just the more tech focused they are the
more likely that network is to be impactful for you um but you might find
like i don't know in new york a lot of people in tech are like into like the
settlers of catan scene you go to like the katan meetups and like it's 95

01:53
people in tech and so like there might be pockets of
things that are like stuff you like to do that might also have like an overlap
of people in tech and so you can find those pockets if you want
how long should a coffee chat generally be 20 to 30ish minutes maybe 15 to 30
minutes i would say our game dev candidates for networking
should we focus on web dev i think the closer you can get the web dev with your
coffee chats the better this will be for you
have you ever done coffee chats with your students of 100 devs i have in the
past eventually when we get further into the cohort i open up
my calendar for folks to book 101 times but we don't do that until we get a
little bit further on and so once we get further in uh open up my calendar and
whoever wants to grab a one-on-one coffee chat happy to do it
what happens when you have 100 people in your network and hundreds of emails

01:54
every day about all the topics they like uh you're not sending these every day
just after you meet the person the first
time and you should only be really doing like five of these a week hmm
who's the author of the book it's dale carnegie
funny thing is that that's not their real name they changed it because
carnegie sounded more business-like and so they knew they would sell more
books if they changed their last name the carnegie what a hack i love it
five is a lot yes it is but you can do it and uh my
students that i teach during the day do more right
you're you're gonna cut you're gonna start off small you're not gonna do all
five in the first week or two you're gonna ease into it and get more

01:55
comfortable with it find the thing that works for you and then um up it
how where do we get access to the spreadsheet uh the link is in the slides
you can just click the link in the slides i think so many people ran to it
that it might be like down the copy but come back after class and copy it
there are three versions of the book which one do you want us to read uh
whatever one you can find for free i don't think stuff has changed too much
there's like a digital version now i haven't read that one but just the
regular old one is fine should they work at different places
yeah the more spread out your connections are the better you're gonna do

01:56
is this doable through zoom yeah of course you can find the book for free yeah
uh is it okay to network with those that are in our current full drive they're
all probably worked with in the past yeah but you want to be adding more like
it's good to reconnect with them for sure you want to be adding new people too
uh i have tried this type of networking being friendly with co-workers in
general has never worked in my favor i'm just not people magnet is it different
in tech it's very different in tech because like one people
typically are i mean let's just say it nerdy and um they like to nerd out over
stuff and so if you can nerd out over stuff with them it gives you like a
common bond instantly like if you're showing up to a javascript meetup you're
a nerd right and so you can both nerd out over javascript and that just
immediately gives you like something to connect over
and it makes it a little bit easier but also you have to read that book

01:57
you have to read the book like it's just if you don't have those skills in your
arsenal this is not going to work for you cool
and when i call people nerds i'm also calling myself the a big nerd too
what if the coffee chat went so great they offer you a job in like a month but
you're not ready what do you say thank you i'll start
and then you learn on the job it's not a coding boot camp folks y'all
got got this is getting a job boot camp so somebody gives you a job you take it
you have succeeded alrighty let's do one more and then we're going
to take our break and then we come back we're going to get get into
responsiveness we're we have a lot of fun with response to this tonight

01:58
would concentrating on companies that you want to work at be helpful yes but
you're going to do that more towards the end of program with the hunt the hunt
becomes like once we're better at networking we get targeted with the
folks we want to network with and we specifically seek out those individuals
so for right now you want to kind of do general networking get comfortable with
it figure out what works for you what doesn't work for you like this whole
part of the whole part of this networking phase is to like figure out
what works for you so that when we get to the phase where
we have to be targeted with our networking we're good at it
what if i'm not nerdy enough that's okay you're gonna find you gotta find the
group that works for you you know all right

01:59
what if the event overlaps with class i mean vods are always available right
after figure out what's the priority for you
how long should a typical coffee chat go
for i think i said like 15 to 30 minutes is like good
can you meet people at hackathons absolutely yeah hackathons are a great
place to meet folks because you're working together on a team
i mentioned the community groups and i think hackathons kind of get lumped into
those community groups there are a lot of cities like groups that come together
to build stuff every week and so i know like code for boston came
every week to build stuff together um they're typically like civic-minded
stuff where they're building tools to help people and so like you're kind of
like doing one part volunteering one part hanging out and building stuff with
people that's really great um also a lot of conferences nowadays have like
quiet networking or like quiet sessions so at like libre planet they always have

02:00
uh two parties that happen at the same time uh one party's like at a pub it's
like rancorous there's lots of like there's like meeting a lot of people
you're drinking like doing all that but they always at the same time
open up a space where people can come and just work together on like different
free software projects right and so it's about finding what works for you right
you'll often find like more quiet spaces where you can like work with others and
so like i said there's there's such a range of places that you can meet people
don't think that you're only gonna be good at one thing try them all
try them all multiple times and then really make that decision you know what
i find conferences are the best for me i'm gonna load up on my conferences i
find these meet-ups are the best thing i'm gonna load up on meetups i find that
like hacking sessions where i get to meet up with other engineers and build
stuff is what works best for me i'm gonna load up on those right and so you
got to you got to you got to figure out what works for you

02:01
are there beginner hackathons oh yeah there's tons of them uh
can 15 year olds get internships and network like adults absolutely the
younger you are the easier this is like the younger you are the more likely
people are to help you and so if you're like if you're like a youngin right
people are gonna be more likely to like take have coffee chats with you and um
so if you're like if you're like a teenager that's listening to this yeah
you're gonna you're going to you're going to probably have a little
bit easier time with this because more people are going to be
wanting to like mentor you i guess you could say yeah
yeah i wouldn't worry about that too much and i don't mean like like adults this
is not for adults i'm talking to people that are not adults does your age
doesn't matter when it comes to networking if you're already an adult

02:02
it just doesn't matter all right folks let's go ahead and
take our top of the hour break if you're new here let's go ahead and
take our five minute break we have to be healthy if you're able please get up
move around stretch let your eyes focus on something that's not the screen
and we'll come back together in five minutes when we come back we're gonna do
a quick review of css we're gonna jump into response in this we're gonna see
how to make our sites responsive we talk
about the three key things when it comes to building responsive websites uh and

02:06
then we'll we'll break for the evening all right folks five minutes on the clock

02:07
you just got a new foot rest i'm trying it out sorry oh i like it
leona are we not supposed to be using divs it's not i messed up on the
homework uh they just don't have the same semantic meaning anymore it's not
that you can't use them it's just that there's probably better uh better better
ones out there there are tags out there i need a new foot rest what did you get
it's the human scale one they're like they're they're
normal one that's not the triangular one
okay it makes me sit a little bit better i think

02:08
should we build rapport with recruiters absolutely
all right folks come on back come on back alrighty
how much of the advanced shea house should be retaining uh not all of it i
mean it's something that you want to have a first pass on right
anything that's important we're going to go over in class all right folks
come on in no human scale not human skin foot rests
i've been watching a lot of rome i would have put that past them recently
oh yeah human scale all right folks let's let's power through

02:09
some of our um review tonight um but i wanted to put a little note
we're gonna start adding more layers to the show here folks we have this
networking thing that's gonna become something we start doing next week
we're gonna start seeing slightly harder material
right and the idea here is we're gonna start turning it up right we're gonna go
slow right one of the things i hate the most are tutorials that throw you in the
deep end and then laugh at you while you're drowning that's not what we like
to do here but we're gonna slowly start to raise
the intensity right let's have to make it come up a little bit folks that want
to push they're going to be some push work that you can do
right some push work that you can do right that won't be required but
something if you want to start pushing you can and the overall amount of stuff
we're doing the speed of which we do it it's going to start slowly turning up
not yet something to keep in mind we're going to
start doing and start have more push work if you want it on thursday i'm
going to give a lot of work that needs to get done and some of it will be
optional but if you want to push you can do it and that push work will help you

02:10
go deeper and deeper on topics okay so when you put that out there some
folks kind of like all right paste this class maybe a little too slow right for
them we're gonna give you some push work if you need that otherwise it might be
just right for other folks it might be a
little a little too fast but just so you know we're going to slowly bring up the
temperature all right golden rule separation concerns is important for what
why is it important organization exactly for us and for
others that we work with want to make sure that
our content is kept in our html our styles kept in our css and our
javascript our behav our behavior is kept in our javascript nice css goes where
in a separate in a separate file exactly unless you're doing html emails which
can have inline uh or if you're working at amazon you have critical path css to
make up a little bit of css in your head but for the rest of us we put it in a

02:11
separate file and we link to it with uh with a link tag in our head
uh this whole thing here is what this right here is a what oh don't have
demo pro one oh no all right have my demo pro turn on
so thing yep exactly is a rule a rule is broken down into a selector
and a declaration block declaration block is broken down into declarations
declarations are broken down into properties and values nice
as a speed run folks if you uh if you're new here we went over this for six
classes so this is just kind of us getting our space repetition in don't
feel like you have to keep up with this pace go back to our other videos
beautiful we know that css has read from top to
bottom stuff that comes below can be overrated by stuff that comes above we

02:12
call that the what the cascade nice beautiful
all right we have ways of selecting elements based on their relationships
here we're seeing a direct parent-child relationship where a child comes
directly inside of a parent we also have parent child
meaning that the child can come any part inside of the parent doesn't matter how
many levels deep it could be a great great great grandchild and still work
difference between a direct child and a regular parent child is that there's no
carrot in between nice we also have siblings this is
the direct sibling meaning that the only
paragraph here that will be read is this paragraph here because it immediately
has a sibling that comes before nice we learned about ids and classes
ids are unique identifiers enables us to target one element and only one element

02:13
once an element has an id it cannot get another id and then id cannot be reused
across other elements beautiful kind of in the same idea they're classes
classes can be reused to target multiple elements i can get multiple elements in
my html the same class and i'll target all those elements at the same time and
each element can have as many classes theoretically as they want alrighty
chat how many points of specificity does this rule have how many points
all right see the guess is coming in all right let's take a look at it we have
two tags one class and one id so 112 points of specificity nice

02:14
how many points specificity does this rule have chat
how many points of specificity another guess all right
see some guesses in there i'm seeing 131 a lot let's take a look at it we have
one tag we have three classes and we have one id so 131 points specificity nice
and this one here how many points of specificity does this rule have the rule
my fingers slipped your finger slipped uh huh all right let's take a look

02:15
we have no tags so zero tags we have one two three classes we have one id
and we have an other for bang important so 1 130 points of specificity
some folks are saying why the plus sign that's a sibling selector you haven't
been here for our last classes definitely catch up with those classes
as we go through all the things that you see here in detail cool box model folks
the box model is made up of what three things
box models made up of what three things ah okay i see a couple people a little
little meet up little a little a little buried here
the three things that make up the box model are the element itself the padding
and the border right so you have the width of the element

02:16
the width of its padding and the width of the border
same thing for the height you have the height of the element the height of its
padding and the height of the border margin pushes the box model around it's
the bully that pushes it around right margin pushes it around cool
now remember padding increases the distance between the element and its
border right so if you want to put space between the element and its border you
increase that with padding and then margin pushes this whole thing around
alrighty we have some starter code for this evening
if you're new and you need the starter code it's always shared on discord
before class starts you can join our discord in the follow
along materials channel you'll find the code for today
and in that code for today we have box model practice
so i'm going to look at this box model practice
there is some some things that you have to do it's both in the html and the css

02:17
i'm gonna put four minutes on the clock and i want you to go as fast as you can
in these four minutes to get as much done as possible and then we're gonna go
over it together four minutes on the timer as fast as you can go
don't worry if you can't finish in four minutes i know that's a little bit of
time but we need to need a push alrighty have at it see you in four minutes
this is box model practice get out of here with these duns

02:18
i haven't even opened it yet uh izzy we did the pokemon card live
we did the drawing live um i just need to get your address
if you whisper me your address here on twitch we'll get it coming your way
don't send it on discord i won't see it but if you whisper it hear me on twitch
i'll see it what happens when the market gets
oversaturated with software engineers will salaries drop drastically no
i mean it's not going to get over saturated and if it did every company is
a tech company now they all need engineers they all need to build stuff
we're at like a 2 million shortage right now

02:19
i've been doing this for 10 years this is the most jobs i've ever seen
it's really hard for people to gain the skills they need to get a job
there's a long trough of sorrow i noticed you were in csgo over the
weekend the server's almost ready uh if you check the slides wink wink i'll
share more towards the end of class about it but yeah
we'll be doing the house selection soon yeah the houses are just going to be
other study communities so as the study communities roll roll out we'll have uh
we'll have the other ones too superman hey thank you for the five gifted subs
superman no home thank you for the good subs

02:20
cs go why not valorent uh because i'm really good at cs csgo
no just goes completely free and can run
on a toaster that's why i like cs go and it's really easy to set up servers
private servers you got your first coffee chat next week congrats it's huge
now push work won't be mandatory just for those that want to have when
they go deeper on stuff oh a lot of folks getting done

02:21
my husband on 1.6 that's that's that's wonderful i love that
csgo can run on a smart fridge i'm pretty sure i could probably run on a
smart fridge lafox gaming done i love it
please go slow no this is this is review for us we're going to go through this
pretty quickly but the cool thing is i share all my solution code on discord as
soon as class is over and you can always re-watch the vod
but this one we're going to go through a little bit faster we can get to our
spots in this before we run out of time all right folks let's take a look at
this together all right please give the h1 some padding on three sides
easy to do we learn that shortcut last class so we can do padding
and we can just do let's do um maybe we can do zero padding on the top

02:22
20 pixels on the right um 10 pixels on the bottom
and i don't know 15 pixels on the left remember padding gets assigned clockwise
so zero on the top 20 on the right 10 on the bottom 15 on the left so that's
giving padding on three sides and margin on just one side so let's do margin
we could do margin left of i'll say 20 let's do let's do something
great just like 100 pixels and then uh we could do zero zero zero if we
wanted to and that would just give so maybe just margin on the top just let's
keep it that way so this would be margin
on the top of 100 pixels there'll be 100 pixels on the top
zero on the right zero on the bottom zero on the left right
and yeah the margin on just one side light purple background and light blue
lettering uh what did you all do for light purple
what did you all do for light purpling lavender yeah i think we did that last
time right lavender and what did y'all do for the

02:23
color of the lettering for light blue plum sky blue light blue
sky blue that's a that's a ball in color all right let's check it out
all right so we inspect it real quick we can see
this is an h1 that has the margin on the top there's no padding and
we can oh sorry no padding on the top but you can see if we look
that rng color at the top when i hover right that's the margin
the green color is the padding and you can see the actual element
and if you ever want to see like the fully computed values we can always um
scroll down and then boom there you go you see all
of our padding taking effect all of our border and all of our margin right in

02:24
the inspector lovely all right let's keep doing the other ones here
please give the h2 significant padding on the top and bottom so we can use that
repeating factor that we talked about last time where we can do let's say like
50 pixels zero and so what that'll do is it'll put 50 on the top
zero on the right uh 50 on the bottom and zero on the left
when it's just two it'll repeat right it'll repeat dark green border order
three pixels solid what did you all use for dark green dark green [Laughter]

02:25
dark greed um but interestingly enough it says on the top and bottom
right a dark green board on top bottom so we can actually do border top if we
wanted to right and then we could also do uh border bottom if we want it we do
have like control over where the borders go cool and then orange background
background orange let's save this go back let's refresh looking good
uh oh didn't work didn't work why didn't it work
there you go we gotta do border bottom cool second try alrighty
i know we're going fast this one but this is just a review

02:26
uh please give the section a thick blue border we're gonna do section
thick blue border let's do 10 we'll see border 10 pixels solid blue height
300 pixels nice and more than 400 pixels of margin on the top
so we just do margin top if we wanted to and we do 401 pixels
there we go make sure we got it beautiful look at all that margin we created
and then please make the spans of a thin yellow borders and equal padding and
margin on all sides so span thin yellow borders let's do border one pixels solid
yellow cool and then equal padding and margin on all sides let's just do padding
10 pixels and then margin 10 pixels and remember when it's just one

02:27
right when it's just one it's going to apply that 10 on all sides
so it's going to do 10 on the top 10 on the right on the bottom 10 on the left
right same thing for margin 10 on the top 10 on the right on the bottom 10 on
the left boom got it first try hey nice well done everybody well done and like i
said we went through this fast but you can always re-watch the vod and i always
share my solutions on discord after class good stuff everybody let's just
check to make sure the spans came through all right spans are looking good let's
inspect one just to make sure beautiful you see that padding on all
sides border on all sides and margin all sides wonderful all right let's move on
all right we reviewed all the layouts on sunday the the the additional layouts
but um i want to do the third one together together again
we're using floats for right now the reason why we introduced floats as i

02:28
kept i mentioned before is you're probably going to see them on
the job they're way harder to learn and so i want you to get practice with them
here the homework that i give you this week and even next week will still
require to use floats i want you to get practice with it here a lot of my
students the first kind of tickets they get or jobs they get are like converting
old code to new code and you gotta kind of know how floats work and they're kind
of tricky they have some quirks and so i want you to learn the quirks here right
so that you um can can can deal with them on the job
remember floats are always trying to do one thing really well
and that's get into the corner right if you float something to the left it's
trying to go up as much as it can to write as much as they can can fighting
to get in that corner if you float something to the right trying to go up
as much as you can to raise much you can fighting to get in that corner
beautiful now uh we saw some simple layouts uh we
did uh layout one and two and three on stream i want to do three together again

02:29
because we're gonna use it when we get to responsiveness and so for this layout
three i'm just gonna use our template okay um so if i look at this
chat what would this be what would that be header about this one footer
nice and how about these three oh four sorry what for
cool yeah they could all just be sections we don't really have content to
tell us what they really are so we kind of take like an educated guess here and
if i wanted to distinguish just this section away from the other ones what
could i do i want to just target that that section
is compared to other ones what could i do

02:30
it could be a class exactly class or an id i like to use classes
over ids just because ids have too much specificity but
yeah we could give it a class or an id all right i'm going to open up my
template here and in the template we're going to do that layout
so template i always have a fresh template that i love to just open up and
start writing in we're going to have our header and then we have four sections
and so i'm going to do my four sections section and section
beautiful and then the last one i'm going to do is just the footer
beautiful and if we look at the image it was the second section that had the um
the bigness there so we're going to call this one this the class of pick one

02:31
there we go got thick one there and all the other ones seem good cool
all righty i think the html looks good let's jump into the css
we could use sudo selectors we could use ids right
we could do all these different things our our css already has the box model
hack for us we got all the good stuff i'm gonna go straight to my layout here
however like the header and footer being separate our header and footer are
exactly the same in this layout and so i'm just going to give them a height and
a width i'm going to do 100 pixels they don't need a width they're by
default 100 and um we're give them a border
and we're getting a border of two pixels solid black just to see it and then the
other thing that we can do here is we want to
um just put our clear by default we know that we're gonna have trouble with the
footer sliding up let's just do clear both

02:32
we took our time on this during office hours so you can definitely go back
through office hours and see a little bit slower but that's the idea here got
our header in our footer let's open this in the browser and see what we got
good our header and footer's showing up let's go ahead and get our sections on
the board here cool let's go ahead and give our section of
let's do height and let's give them a height of 300 pixels and then
we want them to all be a width of what if we look at the image
maybe this could be like 20 20 20 and then thick one could be 40.
right like 20 20 20 and 40. i think that'd be close enough
so our sections are going to all start off with a width of 20 percent
cool and we're going to give them a border
not background origin what's that give them a border

02:33
we'll do two pixel solid black as well uh why don't i have to worry about my
borders when i'm calculating the width right now
i don't have to care about the borders when calculating my width right now
yeah we got the box sizing up top right we have the box sizing so we don't
really have to calculate the border size as well
all right and that'll get all of our sections looking the same and sitting
next to each other beautiful they're not sitting next to each other
yet because we still need float let's go ahead and give them a float left lovely
now they should be sitting next to each other
looks good we still need thick one to be bigger let's go ahead and write a class
for thick one and let's go ahead and give it a width of 40 percent beautiful and
i think that'll be all we wrote cool now the heights could be a little bit

02:34
different to match the uh to match the like the the actual image but that's
pretty close enough that's the spirit of it and so we'll we'll stay here for now
all right let's take a look at the css header and footer section
thick one looks good and i say we achieved our layout if you want this
solution it'll be in the materials after class cool
let's get to the main event tonight folks tonight
we're here to talk about responsiveness or responsive websites the idea of our
layouts looking great across all different kinds of devices right
something really big happened to the internet that changed everything in how
we do it right something huge happened that that revolutionized or changed how

02:35
we approached web development entirely chat sees it it was mobile phones
exactly the mobile phone explosion changed everything we could no longer
get away with fixed screen sizes anymore we had
to make sure our screen our websites look good across all the different
devices that folks might actually be using
when we first started looking at sites back in the day they were fixed i
remember what is this 14 years ago uh i was building one of my first companies
i've talked about i'll talk about the street before it was like a reverse
craigslist where folks that needed stuff could ask for it and people could
respond saying hey i got that thing for you and um
i remember everything being built in something called 960 grid the whole
idea the whole concept was that there was like a photoshop

02:36
template that i could use where it was 960 pixels wide and
it would it just was really cool to be able to like build your site with this
960 grid and so like your site looked really good
like you had like a good template to use
um but it meant that your site was fixed at 960 pixels which was like
that was the jam back in the day because that was like the size of like all the
normal screens and so it just it just worked when mobile came out
that no longer was a practice and it took a long time for a lot of companies
to catch up and realize hey maybe we should catch this train of
being mobile friendly but for a lot of companies it took them
a while they had lots of like intermediary steps some of them would
create like mobile sites specifically had like mdot sites and all these things
and there were companies that just didn't care one of my favorites was ups here
in 2017 if you went to their their website this is what it looked like

02:37
you can use the wayback machine to see it um and this is what it looked like
and uh no matter what you did to it it kind of just stayed that size if you had
a bigger screen you just had all this white space there and that that was just
kind of it and they kind of kept this design all the way this is in 2017 like
you can see it right here is really tiny april 29th of 2017 this was their
website right it was not responsive in any way
shape or form it was fixed it didn't matter if you had a big screen small
screen this is what you got okay now there's a lot of speculation as to
like why they did this for so long ups is a big company
that has a lot of resources they had like intermediary steps that like helped
fix this but like their core site was still always this right
and one of the things i always used to kind of think about was that
they probably just didn't care about mobile
like they just didn't care it's probably not where they made their money they

02:38
make their money from like businesses sending a zillion packages a day
and edith from shipping every day would come to the website
paste hundreds of tracking notifications in here and they were just used to it
they had done it for 10 years they didn't want to change it up and so when
ups finally did kind of like get their stuff together and build
a site that worked it will not work but like wasn't fixed notice notice what
happens here look at this site like look at look at look out set up like
tracking's right here shipping right like when they eventually
did like modernize it kind of just like shifted it to the
right a little bit right like they did they didn't want it they wanted to make
sure that edith was able to come in every day and still do their thing
and and they just had to like move their
eyes just slightly to the right a little bit right
it worked and it probably worked for a really long time they probably could
hang on and now there's something that works that's responsive but not a whole

02:39
lot has changed with it right cool this is in direct contrast to sites that
are like really great and responsive so boston.com is one of the sites i really
like the show for responsiveness as you kind of
change the viewport or the size of the screen things happen right now things
have gotten a little bit smaller columns start to disappear
right as we get smaller and smaller we go from kind of a three column layout to
a singular column layout and so what i love about boston.com is that it really
highlights kind of the three cornerstones of responsiveness what
you're seeing right here are amazing content decisions right it's not just
that the size is getting bigger like things are taking up more
space it's going to a singular column they've made really good decisions about
what is important and what is not important right and so
as we kind of bring the screen back up they give us extras we get a little bit

02:40
bigger they bring us extra right and the really funny thing is
i used to when i used to teach in a classroom i always had like a projector
behind me and so we would bring this site up on a projector and i swear i
don't know if they're still there or not but we brought up a projector which was
like i don't know like a 60 plus inch screen right
there were ads all the way on the outside like you can't see them but they
were all the way out there on the sides and i was like hmm why would you do that
i was like well if you have a big old screen
right you probably have some money so let's let's let's let's throw them some
ads right let's throw some ads right but uh the funny thing here is that
boston.com had to change right they had to change with the mobile explosion
when do people get their news right when do people check the news

02:41
if you're in a metro area when are people checking the news
yeah during their commute you have so many people that are taking the t in
boston's what we call the subway right and they want to get just the the raw
essentials on their commute right and so you need a site that works well on
mobile if your goal is to sell ads if your goal is to get eyeballs on content
so you can sell ads and you don't have a site that works well across mobile
devices you're not getting those eyeballs you're not selling ads you're
not making money so they had a really strong incentive to become mobile
friendly and for their site to be really responsive cool now
when i talk about responsiveness i'm talking about three really important ideas
fluidity elasticity and content decisions or a

02:42
site to be considered responsive i think it really needs to have these three
things so what the heck are these three things fluidity is when everything is a
percentage or can respond natively you have a fluid site so if we look at the
layout we just did this layout is really fluid like it can go from a full screen
right from a full screen to like a mobile size screen and it kind of works
right it kind of it kind of just works right
and so we would call this fluid right as as it's resizing it's working
eventually we're going to make content decisions
and those content decisions are going to be at certain sizes
the way that our sites look good in between the sizes that we choose is
that fluidity the fluidity is what makes it so that it doesn't seem jarring when
we make our content decisions it kind of just works all the way up to that

02:43
decision point right it's still fluid up to that decision point then we make the
decision we're still good so you need that fluidity that fluid underpinning so
that as you make your decisions it doesn't really matter so much right that
fluidity is really helpful the elasticity is that next piece and
elasticity is at its core setting our fonts and text to use a responsive unit of
measure and so the responsive unit of measure that we're going to use is
called an m or a rem okay now this is a somewhat tricky of a topic
but i like to think about some like a very real scenario
let's imagine you are building a website for your company or for a client

02:44
and you build out all the css right i forgot that was it here
you fill out all the css it's 5 000 lines of css right
and your boss you you take the site to your boss you show it to them and
they're like leon i love this it looks great um
i just want all the fonts to be double the size
right they come to you and say i want i want all the fonts to be double the size
well guess what you need to do now you need to go line by line through your
css well hopefully like you're doing like control find right and you need to
not only find all the pixel values that you made for your font size but you also
have to do the math to double them right you have to do the math to double so
you're you're doing control fine through this massive code base
you're finding all the pixel values and you're doubling them if you had used m's

02:45
you would have had to make one change on one line let me show you what i mean
so here we have a section and when you use ms m's get their font size
from the parent element so here's a paragraph and its parent is the section
so on my section i put a font size of 10 pixels okay
on my section i put a font size of 10 pixels so if i made my paragraph 1m
how many pixels is that paragraph now 10 pixels exactly
my paragraph is now 10 pixels because the section has a font size of 10 pixels
on it and the m is a responsive unit of measure it looks to that pixel value and

02:46
that's where it gets its basis okay now if i wanted to change all of my pixels
and every single bit of font that's inside that section i want it to be double
how could i make every single bit of text be double the size
what could i do i have all these things inside my section now paragraphs heading
elements all this type of text and i want all those font sizes to be double
exactly i could come up here i could change this from 10 to 20 pixels and boom
all of my font sizes are now double the size 1m is no longer 10 pixels now 1m is
20 pixels so i don't have to go through 5000 lines of css i made one change
right one change and everything responded that's the beauty of this elasticity

02:47
now the problem with ms is that anyone can come along and
put another containing element and if that containing element has a
font size that's what your m's will be equal to the m's only go
to the closest parent with a font size so if you're working on a big team
and somebody else comes along and puts a parent with a different font size your
m's might not be might not be the size that you expect them to be
so to not have to worry about like other team members or maybe yourself coming
along and putting another parent element with a different font size we have rems
rem stand for root m's and they only only get their font size from

02:48
the html element whatever size you put on the html element
is where they get their styling from right so the cool thing now is whenever
you use rems it'll always look that html element and figure out what to do now
you're saying leon rem sound great if i ever want it to double the size of my
text i could go and change the font size here
and my one ram would now be worth more right rams could be helpful there
but where rems get really really helpful is that it helps us with individuals
that may have some accessibility concerns we right now are using
the i'm right now using i'm gonna say i'm using my browser right now with the
default font size right the default font size for pretty much every browser

02:49
is 16 pixels right so 16 pixels that's too big brain for me i can't do
that math i don't want to be sitting there one ram 16 pixels two rams two
times sixteen i don't too much for me too much for me right so what i do
is the big brain move of setting my font size the 62.5 now
the the quick ones among us would realize that 62.5 of 16 pixels gives us what
gives us 10 pixels right if you do 62.5 percent of 16 it gives us
10. so this is just a fancy way of getting back to the 10 pixels so that

02:50
i can do the math in my head one rem is 10 pixels two rams is 20 pixels three
rems is 30 pixels but there's one other major added benefit
and that's kind of the accessibility thing that i talked about if somebody else
sets their default font size to something bigger well guess what
all of our fonts will respect that font size that they set
right if somebody has a visual impairment where they need all the text
to be way bigger well now instead of telling them screw
you 10 pixels or screw you 25 pixels right in hard coding the pixel value
well now as their base font size increases our font size knows how to respond
because we're using rems all right so if they go in and change

02:51
their base font size to be bigger our site will will grow with it
right it'll grow with it so so far we have fluidity
and we have elasticity as the underpinnings of building a responsive website
but there's one more and don't worry this is a first pass
we're going to do more talk we're going to talk about rems and ms again next
class i know it's a difficult topic this is your first time through it but we're
going to go through it together again on
thursday as well there's one other thing content decisions
right content decisions to have a truly responsive website we
have to make some decisions about what content we show
on mobile do we want to show this sidebar right on mobile do we want them to see
all of this navigational content right on mobile we really don't need

02:52
them to see any of that stuff on mobile there's three things that people in
boston care about news weather and sports that's it
if they're on their phone you better get them their news quick
their weather quick and their sports quick
is it a blizzard outside that the pats win and tell me what's happening in my
neighborhood that's all they care about right and so
on mobile we're going to make decisions that make it work best for our users
right and so at different screen sizes we're going to make these content
decisions what should they be seeing at this size should it be there or should
it not be there right to make these content decisions we use
what what do we use to get rid of the content that we don't want them to see
or to to remove things that we don't care about what do we use

02:53
exactly we use media queries media queries are how we can make these
content decisions what gets removed what gets changed what gets stacked
right all these things to be changed using media queries
what media queries enable us to do is to say at this viewport or at this
screen size do this thing in terms of css rules right
now when it comes time to using media queries to make
content decisions there's really kind of two schools of thought when it comes
time to like make those content decisions the first school of thought
is to just take your design shrink it until it doesn't look good
that's your media query shrink it again until it doesn't look good that's your
media query shrink it again doesn't look good that's your media query right
the other way that become really popular is mobile first

02:54
mobile first this idea of starting with the mobile layout first and then adding
stuff as you have more screen real estate right the idea of mobile first is
that you you start with all the goods like the stuff that people actually care
about and as you get larger you can add other things that might be relevant but
aren't the core of what you need now it's up to you which way you go
mobile first or from large to small and it might depend on how you're like who
or what you're working on if i'm working with a designer
that gives me what mobile should look like what
tablet should look like what what desktop should look like i actually
start from the largest screen and then work my way to the smallest and when it
doesn't look good that's where i write my media query i find that a little bit
easier for me if i'm working by myself without a designer i start mobile first
right just the stuff that cares and i can add stuff if i want as i get bigger
it's kind of a personal decision and what i want you to do is i want you to

02:55
try both ways so when you are working on the content specifically the homework
that's going to get assigned on thursday i want you to try both so you see what
makes sense to you then mobile first makes sense or did starting large and
going small makes sense like play with it and kind of figure out your your
rhyme or reason for doing this okay now we talked about the three big things
fluidity which we kind of already got ourselves already in percentages or it
looks good as we get smaller elasticity will add rems and things like that and
then these content decisions will start making by the power of media queries
okay so let's go back and look at our our layout that we just did okay we're
gonna go a little over today maybe about five ten minutes over today
um let's go ahead and take a look at the layout that we just did okay

02:56
here's the layout what i want to do is i want to write some media queries
that can kind of that can like show this content decisions at play
so the first media query i'm going to do is at media screen and a max width
of 600 pixels so whenever you see screen what that really means is zero
whenever you see whenever you see screen it's basically saying zero
and so between zero pixels and six hundred pixels i wanna make my sections
the background color green cool let's see if this works between 0

02:57
and 600 pixels it should be green let's go back let's refresh
and let's shrink our size here boom once we got below those 600 pixels
everything became green right screen just means zero so between zero
and 600 pixels right we we got this this greenness to start taking effect
but the cool thing is we can actually come back
and start adding other media queries on top of this so i can do another media
query here and i'm going to do at media and don't worry the the the the way that
we actually stack these in the future kind of changes but this is kind of just
for us to see it we can say min with and we can do 601 pixels and a max width

02:58
of let's say 900 pixels beautiful so what i'm saying now is between 601 pixels
and pixels i want this to take effect so let's go ahead and do section
let's do background and let's make it i don't know let's make it loo cool
all right and so the idea here is that between 600 pixels and zero it'll be
green but between 601 and 900 it'll be blue and let's go ahead and
shrink our window [Music] 900 pixels blue and then once we go below 600 green
right above 600 blue above 900 nothing and the cool thing is
if you bring up the inspector and we don't make it as obnoxious

02:59
uh you can actually see the numbers the numbers are going to show up right here
it'll be really small to see on this screen but it does show up right there
and it does show you as you're making it smaller where you're
at so i can see that i'm at 937 and i'm ripping 900 right
and then if i keep going i can see the pixel values going down
600 boom there you go and the cool thing is you can actually
right here see these little tablet and phone icons
we can actually click on these and it'll give you the most common phone sizes
right you can click on like phones ipads and everything's built right into the
inspector so if you wanted to see if it looks good on an ipad or whatever you
could do that from right in here all right so we have a media query from zero to
600 pixels we have one from 600 to 900 um not only can we change colors but we

03:00
can actually like get rid of stuff right we can get rid of stuff so if we
looked we had this idea thick one sorry this class of thick one
let's target that class pick one and let's get rid of it display none
there we go display none so what's going to happen is between 600
and 900 pixels this one's literally going to disappear let's try it
all right we refresh boom boom boom boom boom boom under 900 look it disappeared
right it disappeared and they're all blue so what we could do is we can say all
right at the screen size i want them to disappear
but i wasn't i want them to take up the full width we still got that empty space

03:01
let's go back and um make these with 33.33 percent repeating of course
let's make that happen and then when we come back and we refresh
now they take up all the space right you go above 900 thick boy comes back
thick one comes back above below 900. it's gone and everything takes up the
full window and then below 600 all those rules go
out the way thick one comes back but it's a different color
so we have the ability to have really really tight control
over all of the content decisions that we make
just using media queries and the way that we write our media queries
and the way that we stack them and the decisions that we make we'll get better
at over time right this is kind of just like
an exercise to show you that you have the power that you have the control that

03:02
you can do all this stuff it is at the mercy of the cascade still too like you
have to make sure you still have the right specificity and things like that but
this is just to start showing you that you can play around with these media
queries and do things and so part of your homework that i asked you to do
was to make the um the 15 minutes of pain responsive what i want you to do
is i want you to make this responsive with at least three media queries
right once you make it at least three media queries and maybe try to find
media queries that would make it look good on laptop
maybe tablet and then maybe mobile right laptop
tablet mobile at least three different media queries to make it look good
across those screen sizes and think about what you might do on mobile i
think something you might do on mobile is instead of having these sit next to
each other what could you do them having sit next to each other what

03:03
could you do you could stack them right just like we saw with boston.com
we look at boston.com when they got smaller like you can see
this is like side by side right but as soon as we got to the mobile site
they stacked everything right they stacked everything we have as much
scrolling real estate as we want you can always scroll until kingdom come right
like you can scroll as much as you want so stacking probably makes a lot of
sense on mobile because people are used to scrolling cool
so homework if you started on it that's great i want you to have at least three
media queries and i want you to make some decisions right remember it's not
only just fluidity and elasticity it's the decisions that you make so make some
decisions as you're making your media queries
uh one really important thing that we haven't done yet

03:04
is that we have to add something to our template for all of this to work right
for all this to work we need to add something to our template please make sure
you take this meta viewport and you add it to the head of your template so i'm
going to go to my template i'm going to go to my head
and write with the other meta keywords i'm going to add this boom there you go
i might have actually already put it in there for you
you want to make sure that this is inside of your template this viewport
with device width right device with what this is going to do is there's
something cheeky right there's something cheeky these media queries
these media queries actually don't work on mobile
these media queries really just handle like you making the browser window

03:05
bigger or smaller right bigger or smaller like in the main window
what you need to tell the browser is that hey
figure out the width of this screen no matter what device you're on like figure
out right figure out the width no matter
what device you're on and by having this width equals device with your media
queries will work not only on like desktop laptops it'll also work on um
on mobile phones and tablets so if you're ever like making all your media
queries and then like you check it on your phone and it's not working
make sure you have this viewport okay now there's one other really important
thing here you notice my initial scale is set to one that's the zoom level that
you start off with you always pretty much want to have that at one but there
is this one other thing that you can add here and it's it's another
value called user sorry called user scalable and you can set it to no don't

03:06
ever do this what user scalable no does is it stops
people from pinching and zooming and making your site bigger it stops them
from being able to zoom in on their content all right
some people build these really rich feature full websites it looks great on
the size that they want it to look good on and they set it to notes that people
can't like mess with that experience you're screwing over folks that have
some accessibility concerns when viewing the web about like 10 of users
need to use a very common accessibility feature which is pinch to zoom
i always ask my students just to pay attention on the subway if you pay
attention to the subway you're guaranteed after like a day or two of
paying attention to see someone like holding their phone close and then
pinching and zooming it's the most common accessibility feature that we
need and if you turn that off you're screwing over at least 10 of your users
right so make sure that you never set user scalable to know and add this meta

03:07
viewport to your head of any of your templates so you don't have to worry
about figuring out different types of devices and your media queries will just
work all right one last thing before we break
take me a minute or two to get through it i wanted to show you the magic
of flexbox right i wanted to show you the magic of
flexbox we've been using floats your homework will be asking you to use
floats i need you to practice your floats but we will move on to flexbox
and we'll see a little bit of grid too i just want to show it to you just see
just so you could see it right just so you could see it and see what it does
now the cool thing about flexbox is that it helps us to figure out um layout in
one dimension right rows or columns and there's a lot of like little bits of
vocabulary that you need to learn but once you learn that little bit of

03:08
vocabulary you can throw out kind of needing to know percentages or figuring
out the quick maths you can kind of just use these words and it'll do it for you
so if you wanted all your stuff to be at the left hand side you could use flex
start if you wanted stuff to be centered instead of putting margin on the left
and right or using some sort of auto you just say center and it centers it for
you if you want it to have stuff with space in between instead of doing like
20 20 20 and then figuring out like all right 20 here 20 here for the gap
instead of having to figure out the widths
and the gaps for those whiffs right you would just say space between it would
automatically give you the space between if you want it space evenly around you
can say space around and so this wonderful graphic comes from css tricks
complete guide to flexbox it is my favorite like article
on how to use flexbox and it's now part of your homework you must read this

03:09
article it's a really great introduction the flexbox but i want to show you
the power real quick there's all these cool things that help
us but let me show you something that's really fun so let's look at an example
here i have this lovely flexbox example that's ready to go
let me go ahead and close the template i'm going to open up the flexbox example
all right so here's my flexbox example i have
the html and the css here ready to go and you'll notice that in my html
i have three sections uh inside of my main and i have two sections inside of
something that a section has the class of bottom
i want all of these sections to have equal sizing and sit next to each other
if we were going to do this with floats i would need to do the quick maths of

03:10
figuring out the widths of all of these the percentages floating them if i
wanted to figure out these ones i would have to go figure out different
percentages and figure out floating them next to each other right but with flex
you don't need to do any quick maths all right so let me show you
let's go ahead and do our normal setup like our normal layout here i'm going to
do my header and my footer and give them a height of 100 pixels
right give it a border uh one pixel solid black right
and then let's go ahead and do our sections so section
let's give them i don't know height like 200 pixels
and we're going to give them a border uh let's do one pixel solid
black all right and [Music] yeah so that's all of our sections right
so we have all of our sections let's go ahead and save this let's open this in

03:11
the browser all right we're looking like normal
right we're looking normal here we have our header we have our footer we have
all of our sections of equal wisp but they're stacking they're not sitting
next to each other right it's not the layout that we expect or want to see
if we're doing the old way that floats we'd have to do all the percentages we
have to float them we have to do clearing we have to do all this stuff right so
the way flex works as long as the containers are set to flex
and you tell them how much room you want each thing to take up it kind of just
works so the two containers we have here are main
and bottom so i'm going to go ahead and write a rule here for main and bottom
main and bottom i'm just going to give it display flex
and i'm going to tell each section to kind of just take up one spot

03:12
like one spot flex one there we go so i said all right
main and bottom were flex containers that's it and take up one spot each
let's save it let's come back let's refresh magic look at that beautiful magic
look at it we got our three sections in main just sitting
nice and neat next to each other we got our two
sections in the one that was in the the class of bottom just sitting next to
each other no percentages no worrying about clearing or floating
we set the containers to flex we told them to take up one each and it just
works so we're working towards this folks we're
working towards this idea that we're using floats now so that when we're on
the job we don't get into a pickle but we'll move to flex we'll we'll
unleash the magic of flex and and grid hopefully that kind of blew your mind a

03:13
little bit if you haven't seen uh flex yet right
and we have some some homework to work on uh you're gonna read about flex even
though you're not using it until next week's right we have a lot of stuff
that's assigned this week i don't want you to use flex on this stuff yeah i
still want to use floats we have to start reading about flex so we can use
it next week so i want you to read the complete guide to flexbox
and i want you to do flexbox froggy flexbuck froggy is a video game
that just helps you learn flexbox it's really fun it doesn't really
doesn't really take too too long to get through
but it can be a lot of fun just to work through it and
then of course the most important thing is to uh watch independence day for
homework cool that's the homework that's coming up
we have more stuff that we're going to get assigned on thursday on thursday

03:14
we're getting assigned a lot of like building like building actual sites
because now you know html now you know css now you know how to make things
responsive so now we got to start practicing right we
got to start building real sites real websites that that looked like
stuff you would build for a client that looked like stuff you would build on the
job that's what we're moving to starting on thursday
also i mentioned this idea of starting a cs go server well i made one
and i worked with somebody over the weekend to get it all set up and do all
the fancy things that i wanted to be set up as
it is a 24 7 office server if you've never played cs go there is a map called
the office this server 400 devs is only the office so
if anybody ever asks you do you go into the office you can say yes i spent a lot
of time in the 100 devs office i put a lot of time into the 100 devs office i'm
always hanging out there so this will be our office now

03:15
i gotta test the server i'm not gonna make an announcement just like after
class like an hour two later from now i'm gonna share a server link if you
want to come in and test the server with me it's 64 slots
cs go is completely free to play it can run on pretty much any device
so yeah i just want to have some a fun place people that want to game together
we'll have the server i'm going to be testing it out and then i'm going to
turn off the server and then we'll do like a bigger release for it so if
you're interested probably like an hour or two from now i'll share the link uh
we'll play it but for now we have to raid
and so i'm going to go ahead and set up the raid
we have someone that's working on react native and so let's go ahead sprint some
love some positivity give them a follow if you haven't given
them a follow before remember if you do the raid you get uh lovely
channel points which are coming in handy

03:16
folks so i hope you had some fun tonight i hope you learned a lot i know the end
went a little fast but always come back watch the vod i'll
always share my materials on discord after
it was really fun starting the idea of networking together don't worry thursday
we're doing more thursday we're going to see networking again we're going to see
all this response in this again this is not the first this is not the last this
is just the beginning all right folks have a wonderful rest of the night hope
you all have a good wednesday as well and i'll see you at class again on
thursday let's read
