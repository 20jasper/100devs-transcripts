00:02

00:03
yo hey yo yo hey good morning good afternoon good evening
no matter where you're coming from hope you all are doing well
welcome back everybody i'm going to tell you can you hear me all right now
this one almost didn't happen this one didn't almost happen

00:04
everything that could have went wrong went wrong so
i had to move my desk set up so i moved everything
uh if you saw the old picture of my desk
you know that that's no easy feat uh all the monitors hundreds of cables
everything's plugged in i did a few test recordings
uh yesterday and was kind of like making sure everything was working for class
today and then i go to like do my normal pre-stream routine and get everything
set up one camera's not working the the mics
not working you can't hear desktop sound uh everything just like broke and then
spotify when it works that's why there was no music in the beginning uh but you
know what sometimes in life they're gonna be some boats
and some logs and you have to pick those suckers up and just carry them so we're
doing it we're gonna make it work this is our last class of css before we hit

00:05
javascript we're going to come back don't worry
we're going to come back we're going to come back we're going to do a little bit
more css a little bit more html but for now
this is the last one before javascript on thursday baby and i can't wait
can't wait all right so let's talk about uh let's see everybody get in here i
know we started a little late so let's get some folks in here let's do what we
normally do we got some questions questions first folks uh let me send the
actual go live message now that we're actually live cool
but the question of the day from the go live message is
would you rather only be able to whisper or only be able to shout
the rest of your life whisper or shout the rest of your life what
would you want throw it in chat for me please
okay this one this one is overwhelmingly whisper

00:06
like it's not it's not even close there's there's one person saying shout
in all caps which i guess is very fitting uh but yeah it seems like the
the whisper is the move you know what i thought about this at first at first i
was gonna be the shout person but then i was like you know what i can just carry
like a little pocket megaphone and maybe i can put that pocket megaphone up and
whisper and then i also thought maybe you know what maybe if i'm forced to
whisper i'll get more smooth you know a little bit more smooth
i can i can do all the the the fancy whispering right but i think i'm gonna
go whisper on this one all right folks as people get in here we
know we start a little bit a few minutes
in because of the technical difficulties
uh but any questions any questions let's get some questions going before we jump
into the mix today hey lehigh getting worse the world ain't ready a
we would be covering unit test in jess not for a very long time we'll we'll

00:07
have like a little bit of a class on it but it's just not something that i think
is gonna hold you back from getting a job so it's not something we'll go super
deep in and each company that you join will probably do it slightly differently
with slightly different tools and so we'll cover a little bit of jess a
little bit of mocha just because i think it's fun and then um yeah just a bit
fries or nachos definitely nachos is it normal to feel like we're struggling yes
absolutely okay to feel like you're struggling uh you've had what
this is this is this is our this we have we've been into it a month right we've
been into it a month you've only had what five or six classes
on css not even four classes five classes on css uh
it's totally okay to be struggling to be
picking up some of those boats and those logs and it feeling a little heavy

00:08
you're gonna get through it welcome to the trough of sorrow we
talked about it last thursday you're in the trough of sorrow welcome uh you're
about to crash and hit the bottom when we get to javascript on thursday but
this is a boot camp right that terminology is there for a reason you're
you're not here to become perfect you're here to become fighting fit
right and so as we move through the html as we move through the css you got to
ask yourself am i learning am i picking up tools am i able to start and get
thrown into projects am i asking a lot of questions am i doing my anki am i
doing my pomodoro am i doing all these things that are setting myself up to be
successful and if the answer is yes you're doing all the things to set
yourself up to be successful you're using your anki every day you're asking
questions on discord every day and you're doing the work that's assigned to you
then yes you're in a totally fine spot to be in things will come with time okay

00:09
we're not here to be perfect i saw a couple people
on discord over the weekend kind of asking a very similar question right
asking a very similar question like hey as i'm working through the layouts
things just kind of break more the more time i put into it the more things break
great welcome that's part of the process right
making sure you're getting in there you're throwing yourself into it you're
breaking stuff your your the things will take a little bit time from the sink in
and i don't care if you're the best person that's ever coded in the world
learning html and css in just a month is not really feasible
right i don't care if you're the best coder that's ever existed one month with
html and css that's like part time after work maybe for some of you it's just
you're not going to walk away feeling like yes i got it
like i'm ready to move on no this class will always be us going down
the roller coaster like beyonce right our hair is flowing we're having fun

00:10
we're enjoying it but we're never gonna really feel like i've mastered this
topic like i i i am i am ready to move on it's just it's just not going to come
we're here to to push and give you a base skill set and a lot of different
things and then once you get on the job you'll have to learn different tools or
different things and you'll keep pushing and that first year in the job is where
you learn the most so with the css and html
if you understand the concepts right if you understand the concepts the things
we're getting at when we talk about layout when we talk about box one when
we talk about all the basics that we covered that's a good spot to be in once
we get through javascript we start building real stuff
when you have real things to build you're forced to learn and to push and
to get better so even though this is our last time with
html and css before javascript it is not

00:11
our last time with html and css you will have dozens of projects that force you
to use html and css that force you to get comfortable with it that force you
to keep pushing right but at no point in time will you get that warm fuzzy
feeling being like yes no we're here for a boot camp we're here to get fighting
fit we're here to push we're here to break things we're here to be baddies
and write bad code superhero superman thank you for the five gifts it subs i
appreciate you right how long is too long to spend on a layout
if you feel like you're getting stuck it's time to move to a different layout
and so my recommendation is that if you're ever stuck on one piece for more
than 20 minutes it's a wrap you're cut move on to the next one right
and so i think it's really thank you for the uh gifted subs it's a

00:12
little delayed that's cool um you will right yeah you will
be seeing html and css over and over and
over and over and over again right these layouts are not the only layouts you'll
ever do you're gonna have so many other layouts to do over and over and over
again if i'm spending more than 20 minutes on
anything in coding i stop maybe i defuse and walk away maybe i stop and ask for
help but i move on one of the best things i've ever done
whoever did when it came to me learning layout was to do a layout
learn what i what i learned in that moment of the layout but then i got
stuck right when i was first learning i would get stuck
and i would just start breaking everything like
there's nothing more i could do that wouldn't just break everything so in
those moments i would stop i would walk away i would take a diffusive moment i
would come back and i'd delete it all and i start fresh

00:13
and i would remember the things that i learned from that first round right that
i learned from that fresh round right and then redo the whole thing and
sometimes i would redo a layout two three four times and maybe on the fifth one
it was i had learned enough to be able to put
it back together i didn't have other stuff that was holding me back right
and so for me that's why i gave you a lot of extra time on these layouts
right i gave you i gave you more time in
these layouts because i know that you're in a place where
it's hard it's difficult you're pushing you're in a place where you might have
to delete something two three times come back to it multiple times move on to a
different layout and come back that's okay that's 100 okay
all right and uh what did i tell y'all did you need it's the first thing i said
is if you wanted to be a developer right
if you want to get through the trough of
sorrow what's the first thing we have to keep in mind

00:14
what's the first thing we got to keep in mind
exactly managing frustration do you understand now why that is the first thing
out of all the things i could tell you to to be a better software engineer do
you feel why that's the first thing now do you understand exactly
and so all good things in good time right
you still got a little bit of time left for these layouts
on thursday if you're not done them it's all right keep pushing yourself
we're gonna get into javascript once we get through javascript we'll come back
but i really just want to throw that out there that it's okay to feel stuck it's
okay to feel like you're not 100 there but you can't let that stop you have to
figure out a way to manage your frustration to get back on discord ask more
better targeted directed questions no more can
you look at my code no what's the thing you're struggling with ask that right

00:15
make sure you're doing your space repetition make sure you're doing all
these things that we know that will help
you up to be successful and keep pushing match your frustration be consistent
every day and don't forget to take care of yourself alrighty
today uh today we are talking about our media queries just purse work for
all the layouts uh so certain layouts required media queries if you look at
the slides it literally said underneath the slide to use media queries or not
you can go back look at the the slides right and see if it says media query or
not yeah cool we come back to go deeper into media
queries um there's really not much more to cover with media queries we're going

00:16
to touch on them again tonight and then that's kind of it there's really nothing
too wild other than like setting your viewport with and then writing some more
css that's kind of all there is to it we're going to see that tonight we're
going to play with them tonight and then after that you really don't need too
much more it's just buckling down and doing it right cool
all right tonight we're going to just remind folks to network uh we're going
to talk a little bit about what the expectation is for this week and next
week in terms of networking then we're going to review just some
quickly some css basics and then we're going to do a slightly more challenging
box model exercise than we normally do we are then going to look at some
responsive basics uh just reviewing some of the the core tenets of
responsive css we're going to spend some more time practicing with m's and rems
that seemed like a big sticking point for a lot of folks and so i wanted to
make sure that today is kind of a day for last review to look at some fun stuff
uh we're gonna spend a little bit more time with m rems we're gonna spend a

00:17
little bit more time with media queries because it seems some folks are getting
tripped up there and then we're gonna build three layouts using flexbox i'm
not gonna go super deep into flexbox i think there are a lot of great resources
that i've shared some more that i put in the following materials today
i'm gonna show you three of the layouts we've already done with flexbox we're
gonna talk through the decisions we're gonna see what flexbox can do and then
we move on to javascript once we get done javascript we'll come back and
we'll build more feature-rich layouts that include effects flexbox and maybe a
little hint of grid cool alrighty so let's go ahead and just break through
the the important stuff to start tonight
and then we're going to get into some of this review and then some of this
flexbox cool checking in you haven't checked in already please do so you can do
exclamation point check-in here in chat uh you can also always just
click the link that's in the follow along materials channel or

00:18
in the when we go live message as well for folks that are new here we're doing
a 30 week software engineering bootcamp if you want all the information to
follow along you can do exclamation point 100 devs here in chat and it'll
tell you everything you know about joining our bootcamp and and uh
getting along with us alrighty folks thank you for checking in i appreciate it
big thing happened over the weekend folks got added to our study communities now
study communities are just a smaller group for you to study with that's it
there's nothing other than that it's just a smaller slightly
protected area where it's just a certain smaller group of people
our hope is that you use these groups to
network a little bit to work on projects together a little bit but really just

00:19
have a smaller space to to to put around in and to ask questions and have some
fun they they don't replace any of our main
channels they don't replace any of the help channels just a slightly smaller
place for you to hang out now almost all of the groups have been added we still
have a few of the location ones left but a lot of the affinity groups have
been added and pretty much all of the location groups have been added we just
have a few more that we'll get to this week now if you are in a group
you owe an immense amount of gratitude and thanks to blah our fearless mod uh
to make these groups right to make these groups we had to do everything manually
right so we there was no way to just assign a large batch of individuals
roles we tried everything uh every bot everything that we could have done uh
there are things that you could have done like we could have created a bot
where you clicked an emoji but folks have trouble clicking emoji sometimes so

00:20
it really came down to manually adding so if you have a role for your group
know that you got that role manually blah went in found your name
added the role to your name and then that's what put you in that group
uh and they did it twice not only for all of the study
communities that are kind of affinity or based but also for all of the
location-based ones we're talking thousands and thousands of people
manually getting roles and then they did it again for the location groups so if
you ever see blah around discord please give them a thank you uh that is a
metric crap ton of very hard work where you're just sitting mindlessly adding
adding adding adding and so um huge shout out to them huge thank you to
them uh because without them that would not have happened we we still be talking
about this four weeks from now so thank you blah

00:21
now for some folks they missed out on this form
they missed the second form or they didn't fill it out or maybe you're part
of ketchup crew and you're just hearing about this now if that's the case you
can fill out this missed out form it is also in the follow along materials
channel should you need it there we don't have any plans
to enable folks like switch groups yet and we're going to add folks that missed
out as we have time but it's not something that's going to happen quick
uh so just because of the manual nature of it and needing a little bit of break
in between doing this so maybe down the line will enable folks to
switch uh and if you did miss out you want to get at it we'll we'll do it as
we have time now study communities are just that study
communities uh if you're not in one that's okay
if you don't like the one you're in that's okay
it's just a smaller group for you to hang out with to write some code

00:22
together and take it for what it is right all right what's the biggest one
uh the biggest one was focused and committed
so focused and committed was so big we had to split it up into alpha and omega
so there's focused and committed alpha and focused and committed omega because
there are so many people in those ones so a large group of folks that are
focused and committed you're in your own channel
and so we're going to ask you to live up to the channel that you're in if you're
in the friendly and encouraging one guess what you should be acting friendly
and encouraging we will be adding soon two things uh one
we're asking alumni to kind of like adopt a study community just to have
some some words of wisdom in these groups as well and we're also gonna be
coming up with guardians like folks that are in the communities that are just
there to help moderate a little bit more
since there's so many new communities so much more moderation the mod team's

00:23
gonna be stretched a little thin so yep so those two things are coming and we'll
add some other fun stuff over the coming weeks cool
submitting work nothing due today all right nothing due today uh please keep
putting work into your layouts those layouts are due thursday cool
for the homework uh remember uh on thursday we kind of walk through more of
the homework we walk through what the media queries which one have media
queries we added some more more to the to the pile here and so one thing you're
going to notice is that when i assign homework it's not always
going to be perfectly spelled out in the follow on materials channel i'm
expecting that you're coming to class that you're paying attention when i sign
work you're doing it eventually you want this to kind of mimic being on a team

00:24
your boss or team lead is not going to spell every single detail for you it's
something that you have to be actively engaging paying attention making sure
that you're taking note of the things that are due and the tickets that are
being assigned to you so everything's not always perfectly spayed
out make sure if you're stuck you don't understand you ask qualifying questions
we have the homework help channel you can always kind of get clarification on
if you need it alrighty networking does everyone have a sound delay no
some people are saying yes most people are saying no go ahead and give it a
refresh yeah go ahead and give your browser a refresh

00:25
on computer yes on phone no yeah all right yeah i would say give your browser a
refresh we might have a slight delay though today uh oh the way the computer
computer held up so we'll see all righty networking
the expectation is this week is that you network with one individual
already in tech okay one individual already in tech
the push is to have a coffee chat with one individual right
with one individual in person no these do not have to be in person these can be
remote right right it can be remote right can be remote

00:26
and so the idea is to network with one individual
right one individual that's already in tech they could be an engineer they
could be somebody in sales as long as they're in tech
one person now that means you're gonna have to do something you have to do the
things we talked about during our first run through networking we're talking
about meetups conferences twitter right the things that we talked about in our
past class on networking you're gonna have to do one of those to find
individuals that are already in tech to network with just one
if you want to push right hey blah thank you if you want to push
right you want to push then throw a coffee chat on that as well
and then of course coffee chats don't have to be in person right now because
of the thing going around [Music] make sure that you can do that virtually
but a coffee just like that slightly longer
chat with someone that's already in tech cool so first week just one

00:27
then you're gonna speed up next week it's gonna be two
a week later it's gonna be three right and then we'll hold at three
neck word individuals already in tech and two coffee chats is where we'll hold
down so this week one next week two following week three please make sure
all right what if we're already in tech doesn't matter if you already have a
hundred people in your network in tech that's great at a hundred more we're
here to play a numbers game right cool remember when you're networking you're
meeting these folks you're keeping it casual you're trying to turn strangers
into friends you're not going for the jugular you're not going straight for
the job right a lot of folks right a lot of folks are
worried about hey leon i just networked with somebody and and they have a job
available and should i be interviewing no not yet

00:28
if you're if you're following this boot camp and you're in you're you're you're
not at a stage where you've you have a language that you're comfortable with
and you can you have projects no most folks are following this boot camp if
somebody says hey i would love for your interviews say great i'm not ready to
interview i'm not interviewing at the moment not looking for a new opportunity
at the moment but in two to three months i would love to reach back out so keep
it casual don't worry if they offer interviews or things like that hey i'm
not looking for new opportunities right now but in two to three months i will be
add them to your sheet right add them to your sheet don't
forget that these individuals right don't forget that these individuals right
exist you want to add them to your sheet as
you network these individuals because in three four months from now when you're
actually in the thick of interviewing you're not gonna remember that person
you're not gonna remember the conversation that you had and so the
sheet is what keeps you honest it's what keeps you uh

00:29
remembering the things that are important and it's the thing that you'll
eventually share with me as part of your homework so that i can
see that you're doing your networking and that you're staying on top of it
can they be in tech now yes can they be retired no because you want people that
can eventually go from friends to referral um so i mean if they're like
super if they're like retired like like five five days ago that's fine but
the idea would be that you want people are actively in tech that could actually
connect you with folks that eventually will be hiring but we don't start there
we start returning strangers into friends and they be students probably not
because the goal is to for them to be a referral right so
if you're in college don't count other students as or if you're in a in our
boot camp you're talking to other boot campers right like
no that doesn't count folks already in tech that could eventually become a
referral cs teachers count no folks that are like in tech jobs right

00:30
that could eventually refer you know um is there a way to talk to mods i've
discovered no uh it's just leonel.com discord any other links will will expire
oh alrighty you're using the sheet coding challenges i know we said they
start this week but they won't start until we actually start javascript so
there won't be any kind of daily coding challenges until thursday friday
but after after thursday's class we got daily coding challenges happening
remember that you have to get a paid client by march 29th we haven't had our
freelancing class yet so i'm kind of giving you the date now just that you
can start talking to friends family start letting folks know hey i'm a

00:31
software engineer i'm looking for clients right that's it start putting it
out into the world and we'll have a class on how to freelance soon and then
your goal is to lock down that client the contract by march 29th so the work
doesn't have to be done it's just that the contract is signed by march 29th
all right we had a lot of folks to get jobs we're
we're way past the 80 jobs mark now uh and we had two folks that posted very
recently on discord and so i just wanted to throw
them in there if you're not in that celebrations channel i highly recommend
you check it out every once in a while it's just amazing to see the everyone's
wins and the cool things that are coming their way arielle speedwagon posted
they just started their software engineering job on february 1st so huge
shout out to them i really love some of the things they
had to say in their message i always link the messages in the slides so you
can like click their name and it'll take you directly to their their message on

00:32
discord but i really love this the thing they shared i wish i could express how
unready i felt even after more than one official offer
i feel like a lot of people are in that space where
they just don't feel ready yet right or they just don't feel like they they
understand css enough or they don't understand html enough that's okay
you're going to feel unready you're going to feel those hints of imposter
syndrome that's an okay feeling to have you have to manage that feeling manage
that frustration and keep pushing right um
i wish i could tell you how many times i got myself got along the way with
imposter syndrome with networking anxiety networking got me this job so
they're saying they had networking anxiety but networking was the thing
that got them the job slipping on my anki using it now on the job i wish i could
share the depths of the level i felt god because i want to share this view from
the other side sending all my very best thoughts wishes

00:33
and currents to all the folks who feel farthest away from the light we go get
all right i i need everyone to feel that in their
in their soul right now right they want to feel that in their soul right now
you're gonna get got you're gonna feel unready you're gonna slip on certain
things but that's okay we go get all right keep pushing and you'll get there
i also love that they say help others and ask for help
that's that's the way you get through this folks you help others when you can
and you ask for help when you need it that's the most beautiful thing about
this community is the most beautiful thing about those help channels it's how
you get through all right another one that came through that i loved uh
this is from jeff jeffen12 with the link uh to the discord message as well
really excited to share that i accepted an offer from amazon i'll be starting as

00:34
a front-end engineer with amazon robotics in march
uh they give a huge shout out to dab who's part of our stream team uh we talk
more about stream team in in in the near future uh and then leon they mentioned
things that we that we cover in this class as being the strategies for
success prep and car are two interview methodologies that we drill in super
hard throughout 100 devs they're super grateful for everyone here and
thank you for letting me learn ask questions give support and advice when
i'm able so i wanted to said a huge congratulations to them as well
the really cool thing about this is one of the largest
study communities or one of the larger study communities we have is an
educators study community so folks that are teachers and educators and the cool
thing about them is that they actually shared this in the thread that was on
the celebrations channel that for the past 10 years they've been an educator
special ed teacher they they weren't really kind of coming

00:35
from an engineering background they were a teacher and they start picking up
coding as a hobby they joined 100 devs they kept up their interviewing game and
ultimately locked down an offer at amazon so i really love this i love the
things that they shared and if you ever need just a little boost
you're feeling down the trophy star is getting you go to the celebrations
channel checked out those pinned messages uh that'll be you if you can
match your frustration be consistent and take care of yourself
what does prep and car mean prep is an acronym for what we do during
a technical interview um it's just it's just the thing that we
do to make sure that we're we're solving a coding challenge correctly so as we
move into our coding challenges we'll teach prep and then car is a simplified
version of the star interview method so when it comes to behavioral interviews
it's kind of like three things we keep in mind for every single question the
beautiful thing about the midpoint of this program is that we

00:36
just grind interviewing that's it we grind coding challenges we grind
behavioral questions we have uh a bank of 300 plus questions that we'll get to
that you have to know the answers to inside and out and we're just lean mean
interviewing machines by the end and so we have a lot of acronyms things that we
keep in our brain so that we can get through these interviews the right way
you can study for interviews this is the thing that i think a lot of folks don't
realize that you can study your way into a job you can network your way into a
job hey justin chat hey there you go cool alrighty
i want to share those two things i think they're they're encouraging and then i
love this gift so just because all right let's jump into it
we're gonna do some review we're gonna look at some flexbox and we're going to
call it a night we might end just a tad early tad early just so you have some

00:37
more time to work on your layouts all right golden rule separation of
concerns content goes in our html style goes in our css behavior goes in our
javascript y i love the yeah right and early organization exactly organization
progressive enhancement another really important idea to keep in mind the the
core should be our content we should have a little bit of presentation on top
of that and a very thin amount of client-side scripting which is our
javascript so as we transition into javascript on thursday super pumped for
that we got to remember that it should be a small portion of what we're doing
because we want to keep our sites light and accessible to all that may not even
have a high speed broadband connection there's a reason why enderly is a bingo

00:38
word exactly all right css the css go in line does it go in the
headers go in a separate file separate file nice remember you might
have some inline if you're writing html emails you might have some in the head
if you're at amazon like jeff is at amazon like three or four other 100 devs
alumni or amazon we need to have like an amazon channel on on our discord
uh in the head if you're at amazon you might have critical pass css we put a
little bit of css in the head so that the above the fold can render quickly
right or a separate file of course we put in a separate file
to adhere to separation of concerns beautiful all right chat

00:39
let me open up demo pro here what is this it's a rule about this
it's a property nice it's a property and we'll do one more how about
that the whole thing i just circled declaration block exactly remember rules
are broken down into selectors and declaration blocks declaration blocks
are broken up into declarations declarations are broken up into
properties and values beautiful remember when we were just first learning this
stuff remember how overwhelming that felt and now you are just like
select selector declaration block declaration properties values come on
now let's go let's go see you so long ago it was like two weeks ago
it was like two weeks ago all right remember css is right from top
to bottom stuff that comes below can be overwritten by stuff that comes above

00:40
due to the what due to the cascade nice nice alrighty
we had selecting by relationships when you see the carrot we're talking about
what type of parent-child relationship we see the carrot we're talking about a
very specific parent-child relationship direct exactly we're talking about the
paragraph that is directly within a section so we have a paragraph it's
directly within the section there's no other containing elements in between the
section and the paragraph beautiful parent child without the carrot doesn't
matter how deep the paragraph is it can be inside an article can be inside of
any other character inside of any other element doesn't matter as long as there
is a section with a p inside that p will become the color red cool now

00:41
we had and i changed this up a little bit when we have the plus sign
we're talking about something very specific we're talking about the
immediate sibling somebody some people call that the adjacent sibling right
right the adjacent sibling so here the only thing that be read would be hello
youtube all right and it'd be hello youtube because it has an immediately
adjacent paragraph above it right cool now there's one other thing that we
haven't really talked about yet but some folks were asking
we have a general sibling selector it is the till day
the till day is typically above like your caps lock or your tab key
and that till day is a general sibling so it doesn't have to be immediately
adjacent right it doesn't have to be the the uh the next one right so in this
case if we did p till day p we'd be selecting a paragraph

00:42
right we have a span in the way it doesn't matter we also be selecting this
paragraph hello tick tock all right so there are a few other wonderful things
within css right but it still kind of follows all the
same patterns here so adjacent means immediately after and then general
doesn't matter if there's something that comes in between you're still gonna be
able to grab the paragraph that's down below ids and classes
uh ids are unique identifiers and it was a target one thing and only one thing
when you give something an id it cannot get another id that id name cannot be
reused on any other element classes their way of targeting multiple
elements at the same time each element can have as many classes as really as
you want and you can reuse those classes across elements so you can target them

00:43
all at the same time alrighty folks what is the specificity of this rule
throw it in chat for me specificity of this rule [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter]
[Music] [Laughter] y'all got cat see i've been setting you up class after class
class after class i've given you this exact question
but i changed it up just ever so slightly nobody bothered to look what happened

00:44
nobody bothered to look what happened oh [Laughter] so we have inline style
what does inline style count for what does inline style count for it
throw a one on there throw one on there throw one on the board
right you got at least a thousand points for that inline style
now if you want to continue to count after the inline style uh we'd have one id
we'd have one class and we'd have one tag now
the reason i show you this is just to know as you eventually leave
the bubble of 100 devs and you're on a team don't ever do this
don't ever do this unless you're writing html emails because nobody would look

00:45
none of you all looked i didn't even look so be careful don't use inline style
it's gonna add way too much to the cascade you won't ever see it your co-workers
won't see it and hope nobody you work with does it you're like you're like i'm
a bad yeah i write bad code i'll use inline style if i want you can't tell me
nothing leon all right if you wanna be a bad to be a baddie that's up to you
it was like you circled the css it's not fair you said the rule not the not the
actual rendering in the dom true that's true all right how about this one
how many points specificity are we talking about
everybody everybody's looking at the everybody's every line they're looking
all right where is it at where's it at all right there's no there's no tricks
in here in the inline style uh we do have a bang important so we

00:46
know that that's that's a that's a one for us we have one id
we have one two three classes all right and we have one tag so we're
at a thousand one hundred and thirty one nice box model
alrighty and we talked about the box model i want to go ahead and do a box model
practice it's a little bit more tricky right a little bit more tricky than
we've done in the past so if you need the materials for today uh
you can download them in the following materials channel on discord and we're
gonna go ahead and open up the box model practice we're going to
uh why is this class moving so fast because we've covered all this stuff
before this this is all review for us if you're new here we have
nine ten other classes that you can go back to and and watch this as we move

00:47
through so we always start off with a little bit of space repetition the first
hour so is review and seeing things from
a different angle but uh we slow down as we get to new stuff all righty yep
estimation point 100 devs exactly if you want information so let's go ahead and
open up this box model practice index.html there's also a css file and
if you open up the css file there are four things to do uh i'm gonna put
i'm gonna put eight minutes on the clock for this one to see if folks can get it
done i will put eight minutes on the clock
we'll go over it together and then we'll take our break let's put eight minutes

00:48
on the clock we'll go over it together then we'll take our break alrighty
done no get out of here what do you need to do you need to
complete what's in the css file go for it you got this dig deep
let me see if spotify will come back on i don't know why it wasn't working hmm

00:49
we might not have music tonight it's crunk dead it might be tonight

00:50
might be tonight why um can you move the clock there you go
case you need to see it uh ads are turned on um because we're
partnered it's not something that like i control like i don't run ads um just
when your partnered ads get get ran if you're sub do you have a gifted sub you
don't see them but yeah uh you should really only see them when
you join though like you shouldn't be like getting stream caught up
yeah sorry there's the music i gotta figure out i don't know why it's not uh

00:51
not coming on maybe we could do let's see try in the browser
about four minutes 45 45 seconds left i'm enjoying the quiet alrighty
quiet makes it a lot easier to think this is fun like solving puzzle i hope

00:52
so yeah i have kids the quiet is great yeah i might need to try the app in the
browser but i might do that while we're taking the break
oh we got some duns coming in nice nice uh we'll get into freelancing in like
maybe like a week or two but our freelancing class is already on
youtube so if you have somebody that's like really jumping in the bit
definitely just go and watch that class maybe a little early
all right maybe i should have done uh the eight minutes here supposed to come
in with the dunzos can two of us freelance together i mean
you can but for the requirements of the class no
the reason being is that when you go into an interview you want to be super
sh you want to be super clear that it's your work and your work alone so people

00:53
get in trouble when they do like combine 100 hours projects or combined
freelancing you want an interviewer to have no sniffs that you did not work on
something by yourself i'm signing a contract with a production
studio to redesign their website hey it's amazing congrats
power rangers hufflepuff how do we do that you got to find them and then maybe
use a color picker to find the actual color
or sometimes i guess you could probably even google some of them
oh more guns coming in mikey we'll cover that in class i'll

00:54
give you contracts and all the stuff that you need
first time i finish the first time is up hey congrats silva that's awesome
you can turn on wrapping kidding there's a way to do it
can't believe i never knew about apple's color picker it's pretty cool that it's
built in yeah those are windows you can definitely get
one from the store i think a new linux on certain ones has it built in too
i don't understand this exercise at all no worries we're going to go over it
together and if you're new here we've definitely done very similar things a
couple times beforehand this one's a little little odder a little bit a
little bit harder a little bit more difficult

00:55
than the ones we've done in the past scalar a congrats hey good luck riv
first interview it's gonna go well you got this
all right folks we got about 39 seconds left uh i didn't see who it was but
wrapping is a feature in vs code if you open up your settings and just
type wrap it'll pop up and you can toggle it alrighty folks 10 seconds sorry
with no music it's even weird for me because i'm used to like listening to
the music while y'all are working i don't know why spotify is giving me trouble

00:56
today is a comedy of errors alrighty folks come on back come on back
let's go over this together and then we'll take our break so go over this one
together and then we'll stop for five minutes alrighty come on back
please give the h1 some padding so let's go ahead and do that h1 some padding on
two sides and zero on other so the cool thing
about uh padding is that you can do like padding left padding right padding
top bottom right you can do that and then you could also
use the number system so if you just put one value like if we just did like five
pixels that would put five all the way around we can also repeat so if we did
like um 10 pixels zero what that's going to do is put 10 on the top
zero on the right 10 on the bottom and zero on the left right so we can
take advantage of this to do two sides and zero on the others awesome

00:57
margin on the sides with no padding so we could do the same thing with margin
except we'll we'll flip it so we'll do let's do 0 10 pixels so now
padding will be on the top and bottom and margin will be on the left and the
right cool remember it's clockwise top right bottom left alrighty
typically when you have zero you don't put the pixel value you just leave it as
zero yeah you did it backwards sorry this camera is the different way top
right bottom left that's so weird because it's flipped alrighty
uh thin purple borders on sides without margin all right so
we need to make sure so we have we don't have margin on top and bottom

00:58
right so what did you all do to get get the border on top and bottom yeah
just do border top border bottom yeah so it's going to do that order top
we'll do thin purple border so let's just do two pixels solid purple
cool and we'll do the same thing for border bottom uh two pixels solid purple
because right now if we look on line four there's no margin on zero
uh so on the top or bottom so we put the border on top and bottom nice
uh gold background so let's do background and it has to be the gold must be the
exact color from the hufflepuff crest so for me i'm on a mac so i can do
digital color meter and when i open a digital color meter i can just find a
picture of the hufflepuff crest and grab the color i see a bunch of them in chat
so if you're on mac digital color midi is built-in
um on windows there is one that people are saying like in power tools that

00:59
power toys there's one but you can you can just download one pixie i think some
people are mentioning but i've never used it so there are ones you could
download for windows say thanks for good new linux uh so for me i'm going to go
i think i already found an image of the hufflepuff crest
so i'm just going to open up my digital color meter and
i'm going to go right here i mean there's different shades right so it's
going to go where it's like pretty muted all right 214 71 171 52. 214
171 was it 52 i don't remember or 51. yeah 52. all right beautiful
uh and so that's the rgb values and so uh shift command copy oh you can copy it
from there actually i'd never do that that's pretty cool um

01:00
so we're gonna go ahead and do rgb a and i'm gonna put these values in
and we'll put one because we want it to be fully transparent and let's let's
open this up and see what we got cool so we got the
how do we reduce the width of the border on border bottom border top
reduce the width oh it has to do with the size of the element so like why is
it going to the full full width of the page um because right now technically
this h1 extends for the whole width of the page so you need some sort of width
on this or some way of truncating it not being a full element yeah
so you kind of got into something called block you could have got something into
oh look at it it's all snowy [Laughter] santa comes late
and the funny thing is i have like a like a white dotted shirt on stay frosty

01:01
there you go leon got snapped like i'm dumb dano snapping away
all right so it looks good to me we got the borders on top and bottom we got the
gold all right it looks good let's let's take a look at these other ones then
we'll take our break all right please give the h2
significant padding on the left and right all right so we'll go ahead and do
padding remember top top right bottom left there we go so we want it on the
left and right so i'm just going to do 0 and then essentially i'll do like 30
pixels so i'll put the left and right for us
and then we want to border on the left and right um but the red must be also
the red from the mighty morph and power ages logo where do i think of this stuff
all right so we're going to do the same thing here but we're going to do border
right and we're going to do let's make it more visible 5 pixels solid red

01:02
um but i'm just putting red as the placeholder don't freak out it's all right
i'm going to do border left and we're gonna do um we'll do five pixels again
solid red and then we gotta go find the red
from the mighty morphin's power rangers uh and it's a gradient right the logo
yeah exactly the logo is a gradient so give me some some room here
all right here's the power rangers logo digital color meter
and so i said i can do command copy let's see if that works
i'm going to copy this real quick and then let's let's bring up the digital

01:03
color meter again all right there we go oh hold on let's see it'll work nope
oh command shift c all right thank you all right command shift c beautiful
nice all right cool learn something new today rgba
or the a's for that alpha channel like how transparent is it
uh i'm just gonna put one because i don't want to be transparent
and then i'll copy this and it looks hey how's it going thanks
for swinging by again over stream went well welcome raiders
how'd your stream go was it fun what are we all working on
i saw you doing the the like the uh model challenge the other day i gotta

01:04
learn how to do that i gotta i gotta pay more attention to your stream
uh you were doing like a tree the other day i was like i just wanna i want that
skill i want to be able to like just like think of a tree and then be able to
like bring it to life that was so cool what are you all doing today
it was good did an art challenge cool some character work okay dope
the challenges are pretty cool i gotta i gotta up my skills and swing by
thanks for stopping by uh we're in the middle of doing some some css so
uh we are running a 30 week software engineering bootcamp we've spent the
last month doing html and css this is our last like actual css class and then
we're moving into javascript on on thursday so
welcome welcome hey and different thank you for giving them a sub i appreciate
that yeah they are incredible it's one of my favorite streams on twitch by far

01:05
absolutely thanks for swinging by again all right so we got our padding
on the left and the right we got our border on the left and the right
it has to have the red coloring from the mighty morphin
power rangers which we got and then has to have an orange background
all right orange background and then the roboto font so we need font family
uh roboto cool i'm going to put a default here of sans serif
this is a fallback of course and we don't actually have the font right now
right let's check do we have it in our html file nope we
don't have any fonts linked so we have to go and get that font where can we go

01:06
to get the font chat google fonts cool let's do that uh we'll go ahead and do
fonts.google.com we have source stands pro enabled here
let's go ahead and do the robot though and let's just select the normal like 400
boom there we go and should give us the link over here boom we got the link
awesome copy it put it in our head we put it before our css sheet so our
css can use it and i think we're good i think we should
be able to have the padding the border the background and the font let's go
ahead and just open this to make sure what a good refresh
all right it's looking good i know the i'm going to actually make blood up a
little bit so we can see that the the awful hideous red from the gradient of

01:07
the power rangers logo can we import it into css you can do imports yeah
all right we got two more and then we'll take our lovely break
please give the section a thick magenta border on the left
100 pixels of padding on the top and bottom 200 pixel margin on every side
without padding our border these got tricky
all right so we're going to go ahead and do section and order left and then

01:08
i said thick right yes let's go ahead and do 20 pixels solid magenta
and then 100 pixels of padding on the top and bottom so we'll just use our
shortcut that we just saw 100 pixels zero so it'll be on the top and bottom
nothing on left or right and margin on every side without padding or border so
there's border on the top there's nothing on the right there's padding on
the bottom so the only thing to worry about is margin on the right
right so we could do margin right and that would be good enough we could
put our padding there we could also do the shortcut right we know that it's
top right bottom left right and so we could go ahead and do zero
200 pixels zero zero right we could do that we could live our
life that way if we wanted to we're baddies we write bad code although
that's not bad i think it's just shortcut right so we do that looks good to me

01:09
i think we got everything let's do this last one all right make the spans
have thin dodger blue borders so let's go ahead and do border
uh two pixels solid dodger blue cool y'all didn't know that oh i did mention
that in class i think before uh there is a dodger blue built in fun fact
uh the dodger blue is different than like the current dodgers color
because the dodgers blue was introduced into the specification in like the 80s
like late 80s there's like they're like when they first figured out like hex
values for it it was like in the 80s like before like we were even really
talking about css or html right we were talking like hex values for for this
stuff like back in the 80s um and so i think when they eventually brought it
into the specification they kept like that old hex value from the 80s and so

01:10
yeah it's a different technically different color than it is like now
i think it's pretty cool now do that color thing again the color picker you mean
i just i'm just opening the color picker that's built into mac you'd have to use
the one that's with your system or download one if you're on like windows
or new linux all right so dodge or blue padding on the bottom and right
so bottom and right so bottom and right would be zero on the top
let's do 10 pixels on the right 10 pixels on the bottom and zero on the left
top right bottom left yes i do this every time i'm uh

01:11
you're i'm not live i'm still doing this every time same thanks i'm not alone
all right and then a light red background light ah there's no light red what did
you use for light red light red is pink [Music] [Laughter] salmon
because in my brain i'm like wait a minute it's not built in whatever shall
i do like light red does not exist oh no i'm like
i'm gonna have to figure out an rgb value i'm gonna have to figure out
hexadecimal value josh is like use pink i don't even think about it even when i
wrote this i didn't think about fake i was thinking accidental value [Laughter]

01:12
this is fun let's see beautiful that looks hideous but that's kind of
our style the nuns are proud exactly all right uh it's time to take a break
five minutes on the clock you're new around here we like to be healthy
all right like to be healthy we like to take our breaks if you're able to please
get up move around stretch hydrate and we'll be back in five
all right i'm going to start the timer i might actually switch to the be right

01:14
back screen just while i do something extra here but we'll be back in five

01:15

01:18
[Music] foreign yo hey different thank you for the gift
that subs i appreciate you thank you dog is there a dog i see no dog
there's a dog what all right folks come on back come on back alrighty
so i guess i didn't play the playlist i guess it just played that one song yeah
he had one song and then spotify clicked out alrighty let's keep it moving folks
we'll eventually have the the moshi and simba cam set back up

01:19
mashi was kind of sitting there staring at me so
bring the dog back we don't want we don't want stream we don't want to learn
we want dogs alrighty let's talk about some responsiveness
let's uh play around with some m's and rems let's play around with some media
queries a lot of folks still had some questions i wanted to make sure we had
like two more bits of practice with those things
before we moved on to javascript of course when do we start whispering all right
cool responsiveness let's get into it back in the day
folks didn't care about screen size all right they didn't care about screen size
they'll make something one size and it didn't matter how it looked on any other
size screen because they didn't really have to worry about other screens and

01:20
then something happened what changed the world uh when it came to us having
to care about different size screens yes steve jobs worked onto that stage and
introduced the iphone and the world was never the same of course there were
mobile phones before then but things really start to get moving once that
happened mobile phones exploded we needed our
our content to not only look good on uh a a desktop monitor but now also
laptops and then phones and then tablets and so we couldn't just have a
fixed-wist site it needed to be responsive now the core underpinning of a site
being responsive is three things fluidity elasticity and content
decisions fluidity kind of comes cheaper it comes a little bit easier if you're
using things like percentages on your width or different layout or different

01:21
box model s type things like flexbox you probably get that fluidity built in
so as long as you're using something like flex or using something like
percentages you have that fluidity meaning that as your size gets bigger or
smaller it kind of is responding it's kind of looking okay and that fluidity
helps us in between our break points right in
between the things that we care about also we have this idea of elasticity right
elasticity is this idea that we want specifically
at the beginning are fonts to be size and things like rems and m's so all m's
and rems are our responsive units of measure
and we use them a lot when we come to things like text right
right and so here you can see this idea that instead of putting a font size on
my paragraph i always forget that i still have this in here
i always forget that it's in here dominoes cut me a check uh

01:22
we have the the the font size right in one m and we have a font size and one rem
people get hung up on this but all in m is doing
all in m is doing is looking for its closest parents
font size so if we're at this paragraph right
we're looking for the closest parent with a font size the closest parent to
this paragraph is a section and we can see that this section has a font size of
20 pixels so the paragraph at 1m is really what put the answer in chat for
me please not dominoes it's actually 20 pixels exactly one m in
this instance is equal to 20 pixels because the paragraph got its base from
its parent section and that's how m's work m's will keep going up the ancestor

01:23
chain until it finds a parent with a font size and that's
what it bases itself on now this proposed this this this leads to a
very specific problem though uh and it's a problem when we one that can happen
when you work with others or maybe even yourself if you're lucky
uh what can happen that would hurt us when it comes to m's
yup rossi it does have to be apparent yeah if somebody goes ahead
and adds a different parent maybe they put like uh this paragraph inside of an
article right if a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comes in and changes
something exactly they put this paragraph and say like an article well
guess what if that article also has a font size it'll never right it'll never go

01:24
right it'll never go to the section it'll grab its font size from the article
right now sometimes this is inherited because the
browsers have their own default size but let's let's stay off of that for a
second right the idea here being that this paragraph will always look for the
immediate child and so somebody else in our team comes along sorry immediate
parent if somebody else comes along and changes that parent with a different
font size well now our m's are different values right and so
the beautiful thing here is that we have a solution to this we don't have to
worry about that anymore because we have rems and rems always look at what no
matter what they don't look at their parent they look at what
yeah they look at the html element they look at the root element which is the
html html element and that's it you don't have to worry about parents

01:25
they have to worry about anything um somebody in their their
their uh this was brandon with their twitch mess their they they subscribed
and said yeah buddy got my sass to compile congrats glad you got your ass
to compile that's hilarious thank you thank you for the sub uh
when we're doing rems right when we're doing rems it always
looks at the html element right so we don't worry about somebody else coming
in putting a different parent a different font size it looks at the root html
cool let's do some practice with this uh this can be a tricky
be a tricky thing to work through so let's get some practice in and in our
starter code from today remember if you always need the starter code if you're
new here you can join our discord leonard dot com discord exclamation
point discord in chat in our discord we have a follow along materials channel
once you agree to our rules you'll see the channel and you can download the zip

01:26
for each class so here we have the rem practice folder so index.html style.css
if you look at the css underneath the additional styles there
are some things i want you to do and you should do them in order please
all right i'm gonna put i'm gonna put eight minutes on the clock
for this one again eight minutes on the clock

01:27
give this the good old 100 devs try and then we'll go over it together
morning flow this is in the rem practice the css scroll down to
additional styles i like no music you can always mute the screen meet the
channel until the timer goes off that's why i keep the timer off a lot of
folks do just like mute the stream while they're doing the work and then turn it
back on uh once they see the timer go to zero i will never start until the timer
goes to zero this is uh stream beats uh by harris
heller it's all free royalty music all low well this one's all lo-fi
we love the voice have you played the new pokemon yet no

01:28
but i think tomorrow i'm going to do it on stream
i really have to test i don't know why certain stuff's not working after i move
my desk uh and so i'll probably do like office
hours where i'll just answer questions while i test everything
and then i'll probably just play it on stream just to test the microphones and
the new lighting and all that stuff because this was this was a struggle to
get it live for tonight and i don't want
that for uh thursday so i'll probably go live like tonight just messing around
with stuff again and then i'll go live again probably tomorrow just to dial
everything in turn it on and off again i tried it didn't work
uh do i use emmet i mean just what's built in but not really
uh the go live channel will actually always snitch on me so as soon as i go

01:29
live it'll always go live so you'll see it in there but i probably won't like at
everyone because i just want to test stuff you want to come hang out sure
come hang out but i just need to test everything
what is code i'm very confused no worries we're gonna go over it together
uh this is in the rem practice in the css file at the bottom
you just follow along the instructions in the additional style
probably do some of the layouts on sunday yeah

01:30
now i didn't bet on the super bowl what should i do with my raspberry pi um
that's a good question i like putting um key wix on it and you have a fully
offline backups of like wikipedia khan academy a bunch of really cool stuff
high hold block servers that's a good one too block ads that's a good one too
key wix is the backup like kiwi kiwis i actually have a whole article like a
whole blog post on my blog about setting up um a computer lab
using raspberry pi's pretty cool it's a lot of fun
so you're talking about actual pie

01:31
what did you think about snoop dogg [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] walking i loved it
dear thing some folks coming in done that's cool we got three minutes
22 seconds left i need some help on that one no way

01:32
we're gonna go over it together more folks coming in done nice
oh this looks good and done i love it how do you feel about sports game result
i didn't even watch it [Laughter] i'm glad sportsball team won
they watched the halftime show though that was that was a throwback and a half
all right folks my grandma hated it what's your rarest pokemon card
i don't have any like super rare cards i mean i got some rare ones but not like

01:33
super rare uh mainly just like older rare cards from decks like that were
competitive decks so there was like a competitive deck
um from the years that i was playing i had that deck and i had all the cards in
it so nothing like super expensive couple
hundred dollar cards but yeah i do have um a first edition like bulbasaur that i
really that's like my favorite i guess to be like super but it's not like super
high graded or anything minute left folks tcg online stream a maybe
i've always wanted to do like leon after
dark and do some stuff i thought i don't like streaming video games so that was

01:34
weird i do have well i think my cousin actually has my ancient view
30 seconds folks i'm doing everything wrong it's all
right we'll get it right together three i don't just know like i just
don't like i don't know it's just not anything like to talk about
i don't really over share in my real life and so if i'm not teaching i'm kind
of like don't know what to talk about the whole
game and so it's kind of weird i've done a few of them but
this channel actually started as a pokemon go stream for folks that didn't
know that i was the first person to stream pokemon
go outside and so there's a couple thousand followers on this channel that uh
that are really surprised at the coding content and it's not me catching pokemon

01:35
outside alrighty folks come on back let's go over this together alrighty
please make some text 12 pixels more text 16 pixels and last text
27 pixels so if you looked in the html uh there's a section
that has three paragraphs with some lorem ipsum in there all right thank you
for everyone that told me about the lorem 10 lorem 15 like when you type out
lorem you can put a number after it which is pretty cool like if you do lorem
all right if you do lorem and you do like 10

01:36
it'll give you the the 10 the 10 words it's pretty neat
so instead of having like the full big paragraph you can control the uh
the amount of text i did not know leon steady learning i do
look here's my thing if you should if you teach you should expect to learn you
should never teach without expecting to learn the best thing i ever did to help
my learning was start to teach others and that's why i tell you all to do that
on discord the time the day that you have to explain
the things that you're doing and not just do them it just solidifies all
these connections in your brain so if you're like leon what's something i
can do to give myself an edge help people on discord it just the the neural
connections just they get sucked in and you'll never forget it um so yeah
all right so we see that they have some text sorry there's a there's a class
with some texts a class of more text and a class of last text they're just

01:37
paragraphs with some text in them all right
please make some text 12 pixels we'll do some text
and we'll go ahead and give it a font size of 12 pixels
more text we're going to do at 16. cool font size 16 pixels
and then the last one is last text and we want that at 27 pixels
27 pixels cool all right so we've gone ahead and done that we've given them the
actual font sizes i'm just going to open this just so that we have it open
and we can see it as we need it all right i'm going to open up the
inspector too just to have it open if we need it all right
some texts more text last text um what you're noticing here some people
have asked about this i don't think we're going to cover it more when we get

01:38
to javascript but this is called camel casing right there are many
different types of casing and this is called camel casing the
first word is lowercase and every other word is capitalized
in classes you can't use spaces why can't you use spaces when it comes to
classes oh simba because it would just be another class
like css will just recognize that as a different class that you're applying on
that paragraph it would be two different classes if you put a space so to denote
multi-word classes i use camelcase and i'm going to use camelcase through
javascript through node it's kind of the casing that i use always unless i can't
this is also really dependent on like what language you're using some
languages really value hyphenated when you join a team or a company they're
gonna have like the style guide for how they want you to name your variables and

01:39
your classes and all that fun stuff cool let's look at this next one
please double the font size of some text more text in last text still using
pixels i'm just going to go ahead and copy this real quick
and i'm going to double the size now to double the size what do i have to
do right now what do i have to do to double the size right now
quick mess exactly gotta do gotta do some quick maths 12 plus 12 24 16 plus 16
31. thank you for the engagement 32. [Laughter] y'all got got
boosted my numbers because there's some of y'all and i see you i i go back

01:40
and i look at the the the amount of people that that that comment
and there are some people that only comment when i do something wrong
so you got got i'm on you i need those engagement numbers up second try
and last text 27 plus 27 54. cool all right let's uh let's go back to the
page and refresh just to make sure it doubled
yep so it did double in size beautiful alrighty
please set a base font size on hey yo and make some text more text in last text
those sizes but use m's instead of pixels
so if you notice they are all inside of a section called ao all right

01:41
there's that ao and so i'm going to set up base font size on ao
and i'm going to do font size and i'm going to do 10 pixels all right 10 pixels
and why would i use 10 pixels on heyo why would i do that easy maths exactly
easy maps alrighty so base size font size of 10 pixels and
then we can go ahead and do um i'm just going to copy this and i'm

01:42
going to overwrite it so i'm going to copy it and i want them to be 12 pixels so
some text if i wanted to be 12 pixels would have to be how many m's
how many m's for 12 pixels yeah 1.2 remember because then m is going to look
at its parent's container right so it's going to look at heyo and it's going to
base its font size off of 10. so if we want some text to be 12 it's going to be
1.2 ms right cool more text if we're going to stick to
this m's we'll make this 1.6 m's right 1.6 m's that would give us 16 pixels

01:43
cool and then last text at 27 would be 2.7 ms cool me too mush me too
all right so i think that should be the base let's go ahead and take a look it
should they should all shrink in half looks good to me
glad you think so for sure all right so we have all of them using ms now
the base font size is 10 pixels great now i want you to double the size
of some text more text and last text but you can only make one change
what do you change only make one change what do you change yeah we make hey yo
20 pixels so if we make heyo 20 pixels that means every m is now

01:44
double the size right no matter what the m's were they're now double the size if
they're getting their base from heyo cause hey yo went from 10
now it's at 20. so let's save it and we can see that they doubled in size
right now this right here shows you yms right
right shows you why m's can be so tricky right
because somewhere down in the cascade i changed hayo from 10 to 20 right
and now all my text is double the size right and so the idea being here is that
if you are working with somebody else that
changed the base font size or somebody throws a different container right
boom it could double and it can double further down the cascade you could have
a thousand lines of css in between this code

01:45
this code and this change and you'll be like where the heck are stuff doubling
in size from right all righty please wrap last text in a new section
with the class of oh see i write these sometimes like a week
or two ahead and i forget the stuff that i that i type out
and then it makes me laugh the power rangers want to maybe laugh
like why what was i thinking all right please wrap last text in a new
section with the class of uh oh honestly uh oh with an h sounds more realistic
all right last text in a new section with the class of oh so let's go over here

01:46
last text we're going to wrap this in a section with the class of o
and so we're going to put this paragraph in there
cool so now last text is inside of a section with the class of uh oh all right
give it a base font size of 40 pixels so i'm going to go to uh oh
and i'm going to give it a font size of 40 pixels all right so i gave uh oh
a font size of 40 pixels let's come back and refresh uh oh what happened

01:47
i before i thanos snap away what happened i changed the parent exactly
i changed the parent the the the the the paragraph of last text right last text
last text has a font size of 2.7 m's right so it's a responsive unit of measure
it was getting its base font size from heyo but now that it's inside of uh oh
and uh oh is the first parent it gets its base font size from uh-oh

01:48
not from heyo right if we look last text is going to try and get its
rem value i'm sorry it's m value from uh oh
it's not going to get its m value from heyo anymore heyo's apparent further up
it always looks for the first parent so since last text is inside of uh oh it
stops it uh oh it gets its 40 pixels and not the 20 not the 20 from heyo
and so we've now seen two different ways that you can get got when using m's
right you could have someone that doubles a
font size further down in the cascade you could have someone that introduces a

01:49
new containing section with a different font size and so to get around all of
these troubles you got got thank you and congrats speedwagon glad you're here um
if you if you could if you could get rid of all these
troubles the cascade troubles the containing troubles by using rams exactly so
we can fix our doubling of last text by converting to rems
right by converting to rems so we can say uh let's use html element
and let's go ahead and set a base font size here 62.5 right and on last text

01:50
i'm going to change it to um font size 2.7 rem
let's see let's see what this does and we'll come back let's save
all right doubling one away doubling went away all right doubling went away
and the the doubling from heyo went away as well
right so we wiped the slate clean now a lot of folks are saying what's the 62.5
what is the default font size that comes from
most browsers remember if you're not using reset.css or normalize right there
may be a base font size being attributed to the html
element and the base size yes is 16. so if you do 62.5
times 16 quick maths you get 10 pixels right so this is the exact same thing as

01:51
saying 10 pixels because it's just taking that that default font size now
why would i go through that trouble right of not just saying 10 pixels leon
why are you making me do math i don't like math why are we doing math he said
leon you said you don't need math to be a web developer accessibility exactly
some individuals that maybe may have a visual impairment where
they need stuff to be bigger they actually will use a program or even
built into certain browsers the ability to set their base font size from 16 to
32 right if you had hard coded this to 10 pixels it would wipe their
requested font size off the map it would
force it down to 10 pixels but let's say their base font size right was 32

01:52
well then you do 62.5 times 32 and now you're at 20 right and so the idea here
is that you can do folks using accessibility devices a
favor by not hard coding this but just taking a percentage of their requested
font size and so typically you're going to see that be at
16 pixels for most individuals but if they have changed it you won't actually
affect them and you can still have your rems and eat your cake too cool
light bulb just went off finally got it thank you hey i'm glad that's why so i
want to take some time to practice some trickier box model to practice some rem
ms and then we're going to practice our media queries
we were a little late on the last break let's be a little early on this break so
let's go ahead and take a five minute break right

01:53
five minute break uh if you're able please get up move around walk around um
let your eyes focus on something that's not your screen we're gonna come back
we're gonna do another practice with media queries and
then we're gonna look at some flexbox and we'll call the class all right folks
take your five minutes and if you need any of this material
i'll always share my solutions after class
so don't stress if you weren't able to type along that's okay we'll get there

01:57

01:58
discard all right folks take your five minutes bring the tunes back yo
i gotta go make lasagna see you all on the replay a
sprocket hope your lasagna turns out good why do you wear your headphones during
classes so i can hear the music and the alerts also
i have a really weird thing where my company used to be headphones in
don't talk to me one headphone off you can approach me
but make it quick headphones off come talk to me
and so the odd thing that wound up happening because of that pattern is i
can't do like deep work without headphones in so a lot of times i'll be
sitting with headphones in but they're not playing anything they're not plugged

01:59
in i just need them in to be able to like actually focus yeah
here's soccer team man you of course dc or marvel dc all day not based on
if we're talking like actual comics i love vertigo more than anything but
alrighty come on back come on back oh i started something in the in the in
the comments alrighty come on back let me chill the music here
being in the live streams is way more lit than watching them afterwards hey
glad you're here with us live do it live all right uh
we have one other big thing i want to do
before we get to a little bit of flexbox and then do our raid

02:00
and that's what i want to talk about is the last piece of the responsiveness
puzzle which is media queries so we talked about fluidity we talked about
elasticity maybe we got maybe hopefully now with a little bit more practice with
the m's and rems you can kind of see how
you can get got and the ways you can get around being got by using rems
the last bit is the content decisions right now the content decisions
are just how we decide what is shown at different screen sizes so we talked
about boston.com when you are on mobile boston.com doesn't need to show you
this lovely like a side or list of stuff happening if you're on mobile you're
probably in boston on the t you're probably commuting and you
probably just want bangers right bangers only you want the news

02:01
you want the weather and you want sports that's all you probably care about so
they make it really easy to see the news whether in sports on
mobile right and they make decisions not to show certain things that you might
have even on tablet laptop or desktop so the last piece of this puzzle are the
content decisions you make when you are showing or making your sites responsive
and we make those content decisions by doing what media queries nice cool
so media queries are a way of saying hey while the screen is this size
these rules are in effect the media queries don't give any extra
specificity they just say hey we want to try these rules in the cascade at this

02:02
time right and so um before you might have seen screen uh
there's print there's a bunch of them all i like to just think of these as
like zero like you're just saying hey between like for starting at zero but
really it's different media queries for different types of mediums so you could
have a media query for all different types of devices you could have media
queries just for like print like when you're going to print something out you
could have media queries for speech like things are going to be read with a
screen reader and so you'll see these kind of different
values at the beginning and then right here i'm saying max width of 600 pixels
so between like 0 and 600 pixels our h1 would be blue
right after 600 pixels the h1 would no longer be blue right cool so
let's go ahead and get some media query practice so in our
materials for today we can close digital color meter here for materials today if
you're new welcome we're running a 30 week software engineering bootcamp you

02:03
can always get our materials on our discord estimation disk exclamation
point discord in chat in the following materials channel after
you create a rules you'll find them we're about to open the
media query practice here i'm gonna open up the index.html and the style.css
if you're watching this on youtube hey youtube hope you're doing well go ahead
and like comment and subscribe please thank you thank you alrighty
so if you scroll down to the css at the bottom in the additional styles right
in the additional styles future leon big brain exactly
um in the additional styles you you have some things i would like for you to do
i would like for you to on mobile make all the sections stack
on tablet make the sections in main stacks if you notice there is a main

02:04
area yep and then on laptop and then on larger
screens so uh do your best i'm gonna put eight minutes on the timer again for
this one and we'll go over it together eight minutes cool
i've at it good luck this is in the media query practice
additional style is that below about it you'll notice that the layout's already
done for you don't to do the layout it's just the media queries
i don't think we've done this yeah we've only done a few media queries we've
never we've never really pushed ourselves with these
rough numbers for different screen sizes are fine yup you can use the inspect

02:05
tool i did i did peek at that once uh to get different screen sizes if you want
uh dragon eventually you can use rems and m's even in media queries too
good question i think i'm just going to show pixels
just for learning's sake but yeah you could get the m's and rums there too
yeah well it felt like water today what do you mean by make it all stack
meaning i want them all on top of each other not sitting next to each other
uh boinky make sure you've uh make sure you've unzipped the folder

02:06
you unzip to get the files out sometimes if you just like open it it'll open but
you need to make sure it's unzipped zero that's all right we got the ketchup
crew on discord so if you've missed some past classes when you first learned
about media queries and you need to catch up you can definitely do that
come on 174 that's okay we'll go over it together
a lot of this is also like phrasing so don't let the phrasing get get you hung
up there's there there are some different best practices for picking different
whiffs uh two styles of thought are one you could actually just look up the most
common whiffs that's kind of like the old school way of doing it
some folks like to take the size of their layout shrink it to looks bad and

02:07
that's their media query both ways are fine m's and rems can pull from
the base font size that the user sets so if a user sets a bigger base font size
and you're using ms or rems it could actually respond to that based font size
and help with accessibility so some folks that might have a visual
impairment might set their text to be double the size and then your rems would
know how to respond we'll go over them together

02:08
crisis you can actually use them for everything honestly
cool some folks coming in done quick wow impressive
yeah exactly if you're if you're stuck go to mdn look at media queries look how
they do it you have to sit here start digging start
start putting start carrying some boats and some logs folks fire up the mdn

02:09
means i have a plugin called open in browser if you go
to this little icon here and you click um search for open in browser you
install it and then you'll be able to right click like i do
but only in the html doesn't work in the css up up up up up up man easy ban
some of these songs snap why do people always ask if i use emmett
is that like on bingo or something people playing bingo

02:10
people ask it all the time all the time is it on bingo
it took me to like halfway through through the last cohort to realize that
people keep asking the same questions because it's in bingo for them
is that bad no use it if you want to when folks first start i don't like them
to use like built-in stuff i like them to get used to it because you're not
always going to have it and when you go into interviews there's nothing worse
than relying on emmet and not knowing how to do like basic tags right seen it
happen so i always like my students to start off for the first couple weeks not
using any helpers and then yeah you can use stuff that speeds up your process

02:11
later on i said we're going to go over in a second when's the merch drop
uh we're working on like better merch than we've had last time and so it'll be
coming soon a lot of folks seem to want it so
we'll probably do a few raffles here and there but check your check your
open your your newsletter emails that'll be the way the next merch comes from
can we get a trough of sorrows shirt that actually pretty fun that's a good idea

02:12
[Music] all right 20 seconds folks [Music]
is there ever a use for m of rem it's a preference right you some folks like ms
they like the flexibility of being able to change based on the container size
you just have to have a team and yourself that agrees that that's what
you want to do box exclamation point newsletter

02:13
alright folks come on back come on back [Music] show the music here all right
come on back let's do this together all right
on mobile please make all the sections stack so
i'm a baddie i'm writing some bad code i'm just going to pick a size for now
that i think most mobile phones would be around right so i'm going to create a
media query at media i'm going to say all and um let's say a max width of 500
all right max with the 500 pixels and if we're below 500 pixels i know that i'm
on mobile right i'm on mobile right and i know i'm a mobile and

02:14
what could i do to make everything stack what could i do and nice
cool it could just make them all width of 100
all right so the cool thing here is that
when i go ahead i can target all of them i can just say make them all percent so
if we look uh there are sections inside of main
and there are sections inside of bottom but bottom itself is a section so i'm
going to be a little bit more specific here i'm going to say the sections
inside of main and the sections inside of bottom they
are going to be width of 100 so let's come up here let's do main section
and then i can do the comma to select two different things at the same time
we're going to do section main section and then we'll do bottom section
and i'll give them a width of a hundred percent cool nice let's go ahead and

02:15
open this in the browser so here's our normal layout
i'm going to open up the inspector just to make it a little bit easier for me to
resize and when i have the inspector open you're going to get this lovely um
like little note here of what the actual screen size is
all right so if i go ahead and i start shrinking it you can see that we're at
600 550 and then boom we hit that 500 and we see everything stack
and the reason why we would stack right is because we have unlimited what
we have unlimited what yeah we have unlimited scrolling space right
we have unlimited scrolling space so on mobile one of the most common like
decisions you'll make is just say let's stack everything because we might not
have like vertical sorry horizontal space we have pretty much unlimited
vertical space to scroll so you could stack everything on mobile

02:16
uh a cool thing that's built into chrome is this little icon right here you can
see it looks like a phone and a tablet if you go ahead and click on that
it'll actually give you the dimensions of pretty much every normal like every
popular like phone or most of the popular ones and the popular tablets right so
right now i have it on iphone 12 pro and you can see the width is 390 and so
everything is stacked right everything is stacked if i go to
let's do ipad because i know ipad is 768 i believe
or i guess it's a little bit different now you can see that when it's on ipad
and it's 820 right and it's 20 that stacking is gone
all right so i'm able to test right in here and see all right ipad not stacked

02:17
iphone stacked right it's pretty neat now something interesting i just want to
do something real quick in my html i'm going to get rid of this
line 7. i just want to delete this real quick i want to save
i want to come back and refresh what did you notice what what just happened
anybody noticed i did something very quick here i got rid of that line i came
back and i refreshed and it's not working anymore it broke right it broke
you need that line if you are testing on actual mobile devices
this is this is something that a couple of folks have figured out and i just
want to show it if you do not have this line that i gave
you to put in your template let me bring it back content with device width right
if you don't have this line and you're testing on mobile your media queries
just won't work right that's because there are two different

02:18
settings for your media queries there is max with and there is max device width
max device width means like mobile phones right it means like actual
devices if you just have max with that's going to help you with like resizing
your screen on in the browser like on your desktop but it won't actually help
you with devices so you could theoretically have a set of media
queries for macs with and then copy them and have a set of media queries or max
device with but you don't need to have two separate sets
of media queries if you just have this viewport so for folks that ran into that
that's why we're we're forcing the whiff to be the device with which means we
don't have to have like special media queries to handle it cool so

02:19
normal media query we're using max with normal media query we have our viewport
device with if we go back and refresh we see everything that's working okay
everything's working why all and not screen they're just
different settings all means everything it can mean that these media queries are
going to work on screens it's going to work when you print stuff out it's going
to work when you're using screen readers but sometimes you want do you ever like
go to print something and it looks different when you print it out than
what was on the page like the ads are gone right like the ads are gone
the the header is gone it's just like the the directions are being printed out
or something like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i just showed my age there
all the og's that use map quests if you're an og put matt just just put
in just put it put an m in chat for me if you're an og and use map quest
right so if you know g and use mapquest mapquest was like before like waze or

02:20
like the like like google maps we would we would search for maps online
a map quests like directions on mapquest
and then you'd print out your directions for map quests right so the cool thing
is you can actually have a media query that respects that and you say print
now this media query will only apply to like when you're printing stuff so it's
pretty neat like you can have stuff that are that works for screens you can have
stuff that works for printing you know stuff that works for screen readers right
and so uh it's just uh just different things you can use there
so i'm just going to use all going forward just to cover all of our bases
and yeah anything below 500 pixels or up to 500 pixels is now width of 100
beautiful on tablet please make the sections in main stack so i don't want

02:21
i don't want the bottom sections to stack i just want the
sections in main to stack how can i do that
i definitely need another media query right i'm going to say all and let's do
on tablet we saw that was 820 so let's do max with uh 8 20.
let's let's just give ourselves a little bit of room here maybe some tablets
are slightly bigger let's do 850 pixels beautiful
and then yeah people are people got it main section uh with
now the cool thing that's going to happen here
is that let's say we start with our screen real big right
right let's start with our screen real big right
as we make it smaller and we hit below the uh 850 mark we're going to see that

02:22
the main sections will stack and then once we get smaller like once we get
below 500 we'll see the main sections and the bottom sections stack all right
cool let's let's see what happens here now the cool thing is we're saying and
max with right we're saying and max so we're saying up to this so that means
we're going to have like this nice cushion between 500 and 850 without
having to like do min and max let's just see what see what happens here
i'm gonna just do the old school way here making our windows smaller so we're at
860 here and nothing happened oh no nothing happened why did nothing happen

02:23
let's refresh there we go i didn't refreshed right
i saved i didn't refresh so let's go we we hit our media query
right at the 850 boom we can see that the main is stacking
and it's gonna stay stacked because we said up to we said max 850 so we're good
anything below 850 this should work and then once we get below 500
boom that other media query is in play right
other media query is in play and now everything stacks beautiful cool
so above 500 we're still in that max of 850 so main
is stacking we go past the 800 boom we see nothing is stacking

02:24
so you don't need minimax you don't some people prefer it it's a preference you
can do this kind of stacking you could do it the other way with min as well
it's kind of a preference and so play around with it try doing all max try
doing all mins try doing min and maxes right all right we got two more here
though on laptop please keep the normal layout but everything should be light
green keep the normal layout but everything should be um like green so
i'm going to say anything above 850 is our our laptop right we said 850 is our
is our tablet so i want everything above 850 right to be like green
what could i do to say everything above 850. remember i'm a baddie i'm writing
bad code this might not be exactly how you do it in production i'm trying to

02:25
show you all the different stuff here we could do the min with right so let's
go ahead and try it let's go and do at media all and and then we're going to say
[Music] say min with and let's go ahead and say um let's target
let's target everything so we'll target main and we'll target bottom
and we'll make them background like green cool let's see where we're at folks
could have done asterisks yeah look at an asterix all right so we're at

02:26
i want to save let's refresh so i'm i'm not seeing anything i'm i'm below i
don't see any colors happening happening nothing's really happening here we
should be seeing some light green let's take a look at this
why am i not seeing any light green ah some people got it
the people got it oh so happy i'm so happy some people got it hold on you ready

02:27
i targeted maine and bottom let's go look at main and bottom real quick
i'm so happy oh this makes me so happy let's go turn up let's look at this
all right main and bottom right that's what i just put the color on
i put the the color on main and bottom let's look at the inspector
let's look at main what do you i know it's hard to see but
if you look in that top left corner what is it saying it's saying 905 and what
905 and 0. and then let's let's look at bottom it's saying the same thing
905 and 0. but if we look at the sections inside we can see that those are 300.

02:28
what happened let's go back and look at our css what happened what happened
oh boy so since that content was floated right since that i'm never using floats
again since that content is floated main and bottom once the content floated
collapsed right so if main and bottom are collapsed
are we going to see any color come through no
there's no way we'll see color because main and bottom have collapsed right if
bane was floated and collapsed you're not going to see anything so how do we
fix this people are already saying it yeah let's let's go we have clear fix up
here we have the clear fix class let's go ahead and on main let's give it the

02:29
class of clear fix and on bottom let's give it the class of clear fix as well
boom so now now that main and section have clear fix
they shouldn't collapse anymore and if they're not collapsing then we should
see some color boom let's go turn up all right so if we go below the the 850
we get our normal stacking we go below 500 we get everything stacking
we go above the 850 and you see light green now
if you had never learned about floats is there any way in
any way that you would ever figure that out it's just no
you would never in a million years figure out why color is not being

02:30
applied why things are collapsing and so
i've seen so many of my students wind up having to convert legacy code
having to take something old turn it into something new to transition to flex
and grid and there's just no way you'd ever realize that there's no way you're
going to google that like it's just it just it would just take forever to
figure out and so that's why i wanted to build up floats so much that's why i
wanted you to see media queries again and play with this because there are
just some things like this that if you don't know how the web works what floats
if you don't know how the box model works with a true box model and not a
flexi box model right you just won't ever figure this crap out all right cool
so since those things were floating uh the containers collapsed and that's why
we weren't seeing the color we put clear fix which stops the container from
collapsing boom it collapsed because they were floating

02:31
all right we have one more we're gonna be asked this to fix
somebody's janky code exactly all right on larger screens please keep
the normal layout but everything should be light blue
um so we can just do another another media query
we'll just do a bigger screen let's do like 1024 all right so let's do at media
all and we'll do another min width we'll say 10 24 10 24 pixels cool
we'll do the same thing again main and bottom all right and we're going to do
background and we'll say light blue cool let's save this let's go back
let's refresh there we go so if i could keep stretching my browser

02:32
window right if i could if i could keep stretching my browser window
would this ever not be light blue if i can keep making it bigger
no it will be blue until i run out of room to keep stretching it right because
i set a min width so as long as as long as it's above the minimum of
1024 it's gonna be light blue if i go below right right if i go below 1024
the other media query takes an effect which had a minimum of 850.
right so if we're at 1024 above 1024 light blue light blue
we go below 1024 which was the minimum we're now in that minimum of 850 so
we'll see like green and we go below that we get into our

02:33
other media queries that we had as well will media queries eventually go into
separate css file they don't have to it's kind of
preference how many css files you have a lot of people just use a singular css
file until they're working on a larger project
preference between coloring the items in the container versus the container it
doesn't it's preference yeah why would anyone do this everyone does
it if you're building a layout that has if you wanted to look good on mobile
devices tablets you have to make content decisions at those screen sizes and so
you use media queries to make those content decisions i show the html sure

02:34
html is what you have i just added the class clear fix
i don't understand why the class clear fix fixed it
so we talked about clear fix in the previous classes we also did it during
uh office hours uh so what happens i'm just going to draw here um if you have
if we look we have this main right this mane has no height
it has no height there is no height on this main we could come into our css and
give main a height but there's no height the only reason
the only reason main has height is because the sections inside of it have height
right so we have the the three sections right we have the three sections and

02:35
then main is around them right main is around them
and the only reason main is so big is because the three sections are holding
it open right but as soon as you float these
sections right they wind up sitting next to each other
right when i'm sitting next to each other but the wrapper that was main
it collapses it literally just slams shut because once you float content like
here's main my open fingers are main here are the three sections that were
inside i float those three sections oop main collapses right it just collapses
and so what clearfix does if we actually look at the clear fix class
let's go up to it it says hey put a dot an invisible dot right because we say

02:36
visibility hidden put an invisible dot after the content right
put an invisible dot after the content right and so what it's actually doing is
we're putting a little invisible dot right here so even though right even though
these three sections are floating and the main should collapse it's not going
to collapse because main is trying to wrap around that dot now it
doesn't care if the stuff is floating or not floating it's just trying to wrap
around that dot and so when you add the clear fix it wraps around the dot and it
doesn't matter what you do inside you could float those those sections you can
do whatever you want to them it's not going to collapse because they're floated
because it's wrapping around the dot so when you add the clear fix it keeps
the main open it keeps bottom open when we add clear
fix here and that's why we can see color if we got rid of this dot like if this

02:37
dot went away well then this would collapse and you'd wind up with just a
flat line because it doesn't have any height why display block if it's invisible
anyway because it's still taking up space so
there's two different ways to like make stuff invisible right display none
actually removes it from the page it's like no longer on the page anymore
that's why you can't see it it's like literally gone you can't see it when
it's display it's gone when you say display none you remove something from
the page but when you do visibility hidden
it's still there you just can't see it right yeah so slight differences there
cool all righty if you have more questions about media
queries and things like that come to office hours we're happy to kind of walk

02:38
through more of them there all right let's keep pushing folks we
only got a little bit of time left and i want to get to some flexbox goodness
all right so we talked about adding this viewport
without it you're going to need two different kinds of media queries
the min device width and max device width versus just min and max width
right so make sure you always have this meta viewport in the head of your
document we added that to our template before
all right time for some layouts we're going to look at some layouts that we've
done before let's talk about floats psych not going to talk about floats

02:39
uh we're going to talk about [Music] all right so let's talk about some
flexbox now i've asked you to read the css tricks flexbox tutorial
i have asked you to play flexbox froggie in the following materials today i've
given you some extra work if you want to learn more about flexbox it includes
flexbox zombies it includes uh the goat traversing media's video on 20 minute
flexbox it includes a free code camp walk through a flexbox
there's a lot of vocabulary that comes with flexbox that you have to learn and
by playing those games it's going to be way more impactful than me like putting
them up on the screen and then us walking through them so i'm going to show
i'm gonna show some quick examples of the layouts we've already done in

02:40
flexbox and then i want you to do those games the games are just really helpful
um and for me like i always still had to look up the flexbox stuff like i always
forgot justify what or align what like i
just could never remember the vocabulary until i added them to my anki until i
played those games so play flexbox froggy play
um flexbox zombies right that will help those things actually stick in your
brain more than us kind of sitting here and doing them together so i'm going to
assume that you've already done some of that work the flexbox froggy you've read
that tutorial and so we don't have to sit here and work through the vocabulary
together you should already have it i just want to show you some some code
all right warning actually let me bring tina up here
all right warning i'm a baddie i write bad code uh none of this would make it
into production i just wanted to show you as an exercise into how we could use
flex uh instead of the the the floatiness that we've been going through

02:41
all right cool let's write some bad code with
flexbox uh the first thing i want to do is techcrunch
right so let's if you want to you don't have to follow along you don't have to
like type along i think you should just pay attention ask questions um so like
don't rush to like type this out i will always share my solutions after class so
the layout that we have with techcrunch is just this lovely like three
column light that was so bad i couldn't even draw a straight line [Laughter]
three column layout right and so we're going to go ahead and do that with
flexbox instead of floats that we've done before so
in the starter materials for tonight i have the layout one folder and this is
one folder is simply the layout one folder is simply the code
we did last time with floats uh so we have our nav with the ul lis in

02:42
it we have a main and we have an aside so all of our core content is in the nav
it's in the main and it's in the side right so it's those those three key areas
and before we look at our css we did some some floating we did some whiffs and
and that kind of how we got those three main areas to sit next to each other
so with flexbox if i want containers or if i just want
everything to sit next to each other what could i use
i'm using flexbox and i want stuff to sit next to each other what do i want to
use display flex exactly so in all the containers
i want to put display flex and so if i look if i want nav main

02:43
and the aside to sit next to each other uh what this container
that i could like go ahead and give it a
container but it already has a container which is the body right so
let's go ahead and i'm just going to comment out all this css
so all that css has commented out and i'm just going to be a baddie and write
bad code and it's on the body do display flex save it let's go ahead and open it
that's pretty damn good all right next is there right we got the core layout
there's nothing else we have to do right they're all sitting next to each other
they're taking up the space based on the content that's inside um we're done
next [Laughter] all right let's look at this other one

02:44
here let's look at layout two bankers only exactly layout two so layout two is
khan academy right so khan academy has this lovely like nav and then it has
like these two areas that are sitting next to each other
right like these two areas that are sitting next to each other cool
so that's kind of the core layout if we look at the html
we have the header with the nav inside of it that we're gonna have to kind of
get those sitting next to each other right and then the main
right main has two things inside of it has like this section here
and this section here that i want to sit next to each other
all right so i got two areas i need to sit next to each other and so
whenever i want something to sit next to each other
i have to just use that display flex so i'm going to start my css

02:45
i'm going to comment out all the css that we had here for the layout boom
that's commented out and so i'm going to
start fresh in my additional styles here
and i know i want to start off with like the nav sitting next to each other
so let's just go ahead and do nav and do display flex
right i want the nav to sit next to each other so let's let's just see
where we're at all right so the nav is actually sitting next to each other
right it is sitting next to each other i i also want the actual lis
to sit next to each other right like i like i want these li sitting next to
each other i don't want them stacking so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
come back to my css and i'm going to add the ul to the
things that are also getting display flex cool

02:46
so let's go and see what that looks like now
great so now each item in the nav is sitting next to each other
each item in the ul is sitting next to each other uh just with display flex
don't hate me please delete me [Music] cool now
there's something there's something that we're missing right like
there's something that we're missing if we look at the actual khan academy
like there's space around each of these elements right and so
if we want to put space around things well we
we have the ability to put space around things if we want and so we could i'm
just going to do it on a separate line just because i know i'm going to add
some other stuff to where display flex is
i could technically do this together but just to make a little bit easier to see

02:47
so we have this thing called justify content
and so with justified content i could just say space
around space between someone's gonna say space around and let's save this
and let's go back and let's refresh all right we're getting there so
the the things have space around them uh the one thing that we're running into
is that the ul doesn't have enough room right it's it's trying to put space
between each of the lis just doesn't have enough room so what i want to do is
i want to make sure this ul has more room when i do the space around and so
if you want to give something like you would normally normally would solve this
by just like doing like a width right we just do it with so we just go

02:48
on the ul and we'd give it like a width so that the stuff inside of it had more
room for space around right so there's lots of ways to do it
but since you're already used to percentages let me show you flex basis
and so flex spaces is basically just like percentages when it comes to flex
i know i'm kind of cheating a little bit there but
save it and let's go back and take a look all right nice
so now the ul has more room so when i do the percent around right
when i do the percent around it has more
room and we're pretty much done with the the header
like the nav i think is pretty damn close we got space around everything
we didn't have to do any quick maths we just
flexed the container of the nav in the ul we put space around them with the
justified content and we gave the ul a little bit of breathing room so that the

02:49
stuff wouldn't like overlap cool all right last thing we have to worry about is
the sections inside of main right the sections inside of main
so we want the sections inside of main to be display flex
right you want them to be display flex so let's go ahead and try that
because we want we want this we want this section to sit next to this section
so instead of having to do like percentages and float we'll just add
main to our list up here and let's see where we're at all right great so now
now the uh this like section is sitting next to the
section with the image uh the image is way too big so i'm just going to go
ahead and give the image a width like i'm not going to worry about like flex

02:50
or anything i'm going to say just for now with i don't know 30 percent cool
all right dope so we have them sitting next to each other um but
there's something weird happening um what we're noticing is that the
the the this this one right here is it's it's justified to the left
right it's justified to the left and so i kind of want it like in the center
and so if i want it or like like what space on either side of the image
what should it be well i'm just gonna give it space around right like
if there's only one thing and i have space around it it's gonna
it's gonna be centered right so instead of having to do like other justified
contents let's just go ahead and you know i don't know add main section

02:51
all right because now that'll just give space around it right if we look main
section right space around we'll be in a good spot so let's refresh did i save
[Music] oh i didn't i didn't i didn't flex it i
didn't flex it right so the the main section can't get it because i haven't
flexed it so i'm gonna do main section so it has display flex
right and now it should be able to take the space around let's save it beautiful
it has space around it right has space around it
oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look at this piece over here
um so what i actually want to have happen is i only want this one to have space

02:52
around right i don't want this one so first child just the first just the
first section inside of main should be flexed damn right all right rap
[Laughter] let's go ahead let's let's step back
through that one and that was a little tricky there let's take it back let's
look at it so we just kind of been adding things to be flexed right when
things are flexed they're happy to sit like next to each other they'll take up
the space that they need i wanted some space around my content
and so i just keep adding stuff to be flexed so it'll sit next to each other
and i keep adding stuff to justify content space around so there's space
around it that's all i'm doing right and so the problem that i ran into right

02:53
there was wait a minute if i'm putting space around each thing
inside of main section like if every single thing inside a main section is
spaced around that works great for the first section because i want space
around the image right i want space around the image that makes sense
but i don't want space around the h1 the paragraph the anchor tags
right if i put space around all of these we wind up where like it was they were
all sitting next to each other so what i did is i just didn't flex this one
i just flexed the first one and so that's what that pseudo-selector was
that pseudoselector uh first child right that suits like their first child
all that was was saying hey just flex this bad boy don't flex this one

02:54
so yeah if we look at our old css we had like
whiffs and margins and floatings and percentages and all this other crap
and now all we're saying is flex it put space around it
and if i need a little bit more space give it a little bit more space
see leprechauns say yeah [Music] still very fluid up until a point right
still very fluid so the responsiveness is still there even though you're using
flex the response and this is still there
let's do the last one and then we'll end not early though

02:55
all right let's do uh bbc so we looked at bbc we had like a nice header
we had like these two big boxes sitting next to each other
these like four boxes sitting next to each other and then the last one was
pretty easy just sitting next to each other
right so let's go ahead and open up the and of course i'll share all these with
you so you can come back and watch this again you can play around the flex
all right then look at layout three tss all right here's the original
pretty pretty solid layout nothing too wild there i think these
still need to be floating next to each other but this is what it was which is
regular old css uh and if we look at our regular old css
oh crap i have it in here ignore this oh actually you know we're

02:56
out of time so i'm going to let me let me comment this out
i forgot that i gave you the answer all right gonna comment this out we're
gonna look at the old css first so here's the old css all right
uh we have our header with like heights and then we're floating we're giving
whiffs we're giving other widths we're giving expansions we're we're floating
other widths percentages percentages percentages uh so much work so much math
and i'm instead of walking throughout the sun i'll just undo it we'll do more
practice on sunday with flexbox so if you're like this flexbox stuff is cool
come back on sunday and we'll do more together all right and here's the solution
um so what i did here is i have my nav ul main just like we did before

02:57
i am display flexing them right just flexing the the nav ul the main because
i want everything in the nav to sit next to each other i want everything in the
ul sitting next to each other and then i want everything that's in my main
section sitting next to each other as well right so
and i gave them space around we get rid of this stuff just just to see it right
so this is the nav navuel main right uh display flex and with space around
let's go ahead and refresh there we go this is our nav with just flex and space
around same problem as last time though it's
pretty good we have space going around each thing but i want more room for this
ul to sit next to each other right more room to sit next to each other so i
want that to have more width so that's where that flex basis comes in again
frijole right it comes in there because i want that to have more room when
you're trying to cut like when the flex is trying to do its calculation i want

02:58
that to have more room i can come down here and say hey you will
i want you to have flex basis of 60. right that's just going to give it more
room more room we do that there you go oh my gosh so good it's so good right
so good that's it that's that's the header
right and it works because everything is flexed we're putting space around
and we gave the ul a little bit of breathing room i'm about to throw hounds
all right cool um let's look at the stuff below it
uh so the main is looking good too right maine is like looking good um

02:59
except the bbc is being is being considered in the flex right it's saying
all right it's saying i have three things here i have bbc
i have this section and i have this section
right so what i could do is like figure out how to like
not have this bbc be included in the flex or
i can just be a baddie and write bad code and just yoink take the h2
throw it in the section and i'll worry about it later so now when i go back
there we go we got our two 50 50. right the flex is sitting both of them
next to each other right and what else we got to do there um let's see

03:00
what don't i like about this i think that there might be a little bit
too much room and so if we look that like main section um
i i don't know why i actually did this uh let's see let's try it out
let's do this oh there you go i just wanted to have a little bit more room yeah
a little bit more room i i i made it a little bit smaller right a little bit
smaller so that i could i could have some room around right because if we look
um main is flexed right main is flexed and i have space around so to have just
to have just like the right amount like if we look at the the bbc logo
there's just a little bit of space on the left a little bit of gutter in between
and a little bit of space on the right so instead of flex like taking up the
whole thing i just i just wanted i just wanted to be able to control that little

03:01
bit without having to like figure out how to manage the gutter or anything
right i just want it to have just a little bit of room and so if i know i
knew if i made both of these like 48 right that gives me two percent right
give me two percent for all the like the gutter on the left the right and in the
middle and so that's all i did i said all right make the sections inside of
main 48 so that when the space goes around it
it's just that little bit of gutter right that's it and then the last thing was
i have these like four sections that should be here
and so right now they're not sitting next to each other so if i want them to
sit next to each other i gotta put display flex on them and so that's what
i did here so i said all right look in main

03:02
look at the section that has a sibling that is a section right so if we look
main section sibling section is the section with all four of those
sections sitting inside of it right we saw this before and the last time we did
the layout instead of putting a class on it or
something like that i'm just saying hey target this section what the one with
all four of those sections inside of it so main section plus section is that
section display flex flex wrap and flex basis of 50 and so all i'm saying here
is right all i'm saying here is i want 50 50 for each of them
and then i want them to be able to go to the next line
all right i want them to be able to go to the next line right so without flex
wrap they wouldn't go to the next line right so once you put flex wrap on it
it's like all right 50 50 boop bring them down to the next line

03:03
right you could do there are some other ways to do this as
well but since we're already thinking in percentages it just makes sense to stay
there until you get to uh play flexbox zombies and stuff like
that that goes in more detail right and so those those sections are going to sit
next to the other because of the flex they're going to not they're going to
wrap to the next line and then they'll be 50 percent if you look
there you go now we have them all sitting next to each other no need to to
worry about floating other percentages or anything like that got them next to
each other then we had like this last one here
right this last section down there and um this section has one two
three sections inside of it i don't want the h2 to be part of it so
instead of trying to figure out a hack for that now i'm gonna plop it in this
first section and then instead of having to figure out the

03:04
nested selector i'm just gonna give this a class of container
a lot of times i'll have like a container class that just has like
display flex on it save that come back boom
all three of them are sitting next to each other now
and we got pretty much the core layout done
all right so if we come back and look at it the real ryman reason is
flex it and things will just naturally sit next to each other they'll know how
much room to take up you don't need to know the percentages you don't need to
do anything you want a little bit of room around it you put space around like
we did up here if you want some space in between you just space in between a lot
of different just kind of words right and so it can really speed up your
layout process hopefully you can see that like what we did these three
layouts in like under 20 minutes just with some quick quick terminology
and so please i know it's your first time really kind

03:05
of diving into it we're not spending a lot of time on it right now but do
flexbox zombie do flexbox froggy watch the videos i asked you to watch and
it'll click it's just a lot of terminology to work through add them to
your anki deck and once you add them to yankee deck you'll be you'll be good
we're going to learn some javascript all right we're going to learn some
javascript once we have javascript we'll come back right we'll come back
we'll come back once we know our javascript right to build
bigger layouts where we can click on stuff and dropdowns open and all that
fun stuff so we'll come back we'll spend more time with flex we'll spend more
time with grid but for now that's good uh if you want a little bit more practice
with flex you want to do a little bit more layouts together come to office
hours on sunday we'll do a few with flex
just to kind of get our our juices going uh i would love to
end with a raid spread some love and positivity like we normally do
and then uh let's let's get let's get pumped let's get pumped for thursday folks

03:06
pumped for thursday thursday we adventure into javascript and so let's
go ahead let's end with a raid we're going to go over to pumpkin days
