00:03
we'll start with our apis so lots of fun stuff to get into but you know like how
we like to do you got questions i got answers question of the day
is are you going rock paper or scissors or
not risking any of your channel points rock paper scissors are not risking any
channel points indifferent yo how's it going how's it going
so much stuff to happen there we like had a huge height train before we even
started melody thank you for the raid indifferent a thank you for the 10
gifted subs i appreciate you thank you so much i see some folks a lot of paper

later if you really if you're feeling lucky you want to put those channel

00:04
points on the line i got you i got you i always like to give folks a few
seconds to get in here so if you got questions i got
answers when is the code newbie podcast coming out uh it's coming out in may so
yesterday uh it was really awesome i got to hang
out with the code newbie folks and uh we're gonna be on the code newbies
podcast in may it was my first podcast it's it's a little bit different than
being on twitch i did like seren and uh levi made me feel really comfortable but
it's a different ball game i got i got to get some pr training or something i
gotta i gotta get my my facts dialed in i felt like i rambled too much but i
think i think we got we got our point across i think we got in there uh so i'm
really looking forward to it uh and hopefully that will be out in may with
their next season yeah code newbies podcast is awesome if you're looking for

00:05
like a um if you're looking for like a really welcoming
newcomer podcast uh then that's it so my maybe my best week ever started
yesterday but y'all starts today are you drinking whiskey now just some
water with some berry mix in it alrighty folks
completed my first cold wars all by myself a felt pump that's awesome dimes
good to hear it first troy with the podcast exactly static
you be fancy with the water i i just buy frozen berries and i put it in my water
i don't know if that makes me fancy or not but i quite enjoy it alrighty folks

00:06
let's jump into getting this show on the road best week ever day one
of many many many to come so i want to start off tonight's class
with something that i think is very important to bring up and that is
to check in if you haven't checked in yet go ahead
and give this a like and a retweet uh remember that
when you when you type check in here in chat that doesn't do anything
you have to go to twitter and do the liking and the retweeting there are some
folks that think just typing in like bang check and doesn't no that just
brings up the link so it's going to be clear so that way you're you're doing
the liking and the retweeting so that when we get the end and you need help
you've checked in just to make sure everybody's on the
same page i didn't realize that some people thought that that's that's how it
worked but you actually got to go to twitter and do it
all right i see a lot of people that are like uh oh

00:07
god got some classes then gonna go back through oh no he got got exactly oh boy
great thank you for checking in but seriously
there's something that i want to bring up my promise when we started this boot
camp is that i go at the pace of the cohort and my promise with this boot camp
is that as things get tough i will do my best to pull you back into
the roller coaster what you got to realize
is that we are all on the same ride some
of us might be in a few seats above so a few of us might be a few seats back but
we're all on the same roller coaster ride together and we're going to go
together nobody's getting left behind we go together we don't go at all now if

00:08
things recently have been bumpy for you the roller coaster feels like it's
shaking a little too much that's okay you are absolutely 100 not alone
if a raise threw you through a loop and your loops gave you properties and
methods and the whole thing's getting jumbled that's all right
you're probably at the back of the roller coaster still coming down the big
dip you're still being beyonce but you're screaming a little too loud i got
you don't worry don't worry i don't know if anyone's told you yet
but this learning the code stuff is pretty hard there there's a reason
why not everyone is a developer and it has nothing to do with aptitude
it has nothing to do with their ability to be good at math

00:09
it has to do with everything to do with not giving up
finding good ways to manage their frustration
being consistent and taking care of themselves so tonight i know a lot of you
are in a rough place with the current material and that's okay
what we're gonna do tonight is we're gonna we're gonna dial down some things
and turn some other things up so we're gonna give you a little bit of breathing
room in some areas and dial up some things in other areas and so if you feel
like you're a little behind you feel like things are going a little too fast
i got you we're gonna we're gonna dial some things
down refocus in some other areas so we can get through it together now
if you're one of the folks that are saying leon i'm in the front of the
roller coaster this is great right i'm my hands are still up i'm
having my best life that's great we're gonna go together or not at all

00:10
so if you're not committed to getting to
the promised land together if you're not
committed and pulling the folks that are a little bit further behind you on this
roller coaster ride along with you this is not the community for you we'll stop
and so what i need is if you feel that you're in the front
start doing the things that the students that i've had that
have gotten the best opportunities have done if i look at my students that have
gotten the best roles the the students that have gone straight to fang
they've always had one very important factor that none of my other students had
what they did is they helped others around them because here's a funny thing
when you help others that are around you you solidify concepts
things that were just on the grasp of your knowledge

00:11
right things that were just in the grasp
of your knowledge become things that are solidified in your brain when you go
into a technical interview you're not just answering questions you're talking
from experience it's not only your bugs that you've health solved but the bugs
of all the other folks that you helped along the way so when you go into those
interviews it's not just you it's all the folks
that help that are there with you so if you're in the front of the car
it's time to turn around and pull some folks forward if you're in the back of
the car it's time to look forward and see those hands that are reaching out
for you ask questions jump in those discord voice channels ask for help
because we're going together or not at all so
i wanted to bring up that very very important fact you're not alone

00:12
if arrays were hard you're not alone if code wars is hard you're not alone if
objects are hard you're not alone if the networking is hard you're not alone if
getting the client was hard you're not alone if any part of this process
has been causing you strife and stress you're not alone
you have hundreds of folks that are going through a very similar experience
whether they're vocal about it or not i guarantee you it's happening and so what
we're going to do is we're going to go through this trough of sorrow together
you're in it i don't know if anybody told you yet but you're in it you're in
the trough of sorrow pretty firmly in the trough of sorrow
we're getting real mucky it's going to get harder it will it'll
get harder but what we're going to do is we're going to focus on learning
i want to be able to turn up the content that we're doing in class the
learning that we're doing we got to get through objects and we're getting right

00:13
into back end it's going to be a few more classes and
then we're doing back-end web development so if you feel like things
have been flowing for you great guess what in a couple weeks like two weeks
we're in back end yeah so here's one thing that i've also always noticed
some folks the html and css clicks and it comes easy
for some folks that never happens for some folks the javascript clips and
comes easy and for some folks they struggle with it for a little bit while
longer and then for some folks they get to the back end and that's their
favorite part of the actual learning to code journey the the html css didn't
make sense the javascript didn't make sense but the back end just clicks
so give yourself the chance to be surprised by the back end
you can't throw in the town now nobody's getting off this ride right
we we got some other loop-de-loops to do and they're going to be scary but

00:14
they're going to be exciting and give yourself the ability to be surprised at
the next thing that might click a little bit faster than these things have
already so we're going to go through the trough of sorrow
we're going to go together at this point we need to come together as a community
this happened last cohort last cohort i put out this call and it made the
beautiful community that we have now if you feel like things are clicking
please give us some of your time to help
others that are around you that need the
help because i guarantee you i guarantee
you even if you're just the most selfish [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on this planet helping
others will make sure that you do better in interviews and if
and if that's the motivation you need all right let's do it
but i guarantee you helping others will get you a little bit further it'll help
solidify concepts it'll make things stick in and if you feel like there's
some gaps that you have some things that aren't making sense and things that

00:15
aren't clicking now's the time to ask don't you dare post that you're lost
don't you dare post that things don't make sense if you haven't been up in
that discord asking a ton of questions popping into voice channels
hello i need some help now's the time squeaky wheels get the javascripts cool
now to focus on all this learning to focus on this learning we got to do
some things the first thing we got to do all right
so i'm allowed to if i have right yeah of course if you've done that you can go
ahead knock yourself out thing you have to keep in mind we are at the point
where your health is the utmost important thing for you making it to the end

00:16
your hands are going to be stressed your shoulders can be stressed your eyes are
going to be stretched your neck is going
to be stressed your brain is going to be
stressed you've been doing a lot of work
you've been doing a lot of reading a lot of homework a lot of screen time
if you don't invest in taking care of yourself right now you won't make it to
the end or you'll make it to the end but you'll you'll probably be hurt
you have to realize that sometimes you might need to take a break sometimes you
might need to take a breather from class that's okay
take that break take that breather do the things that you need to do always
set a date to come back always say it's just for this one class right
but put your health first if you need to take time for yourself that's okay
remember this is a marathon not a sprint we'll always be here to help pull you
along after you take that breather please when we take our breaks get up if
you're able move around walk around hydrate i'm telling you this stuff
becomes really important don't be one of my students that goes to the hospital
because they didn't stretch their fingers and hands don't be one of my

00:17
students that goes to the hospital because they have leg pain because
they've been sitting for too long at the point now where the work is going
to get more intense and the amount of time that we're focusing will get longer
you're going to be building stuff now real projects and you're going to get
you're going to get into it you're going to hit that flow state
right you're going to hit this flow state and when you hit that flow state
you're not going to want to get up pomodoro becomes really really important cool
how first now i said this is the best week ever
and so for some of you this might be the best news of the best week ever
we're going to stop networking until may
so it's end of march we're taking all of
april off for networking because we need to focus on code
so no networking all of may and as always don't ever let me stop you from doing
the things that you want to do don't let anybody that is an educator or that

00:18
spouts off on twitch stop you from doing the things that you want to do
i would love if you would take the next month to focus on the code
and dial down your networking but if
networking is your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you know
that it's going to help you get the job go for it it's all right but what i'm
asking is that you i i see where folks are at right now i feel like we need to
chill on the networking a little bit we need to focus on the homework we need to
focus on the reading we need some of that time back we need some of that time
back if you have appointments already keep them if you have your coffee chats
lined up that's okay but dial back a little bit so that we can focus on
the actual code focus on finishing up objects and apis
in that transition into a little bit of theory and then end cool
no networking until may client deadlines can be pushed all the way to may 3rd

00:19
some people are like hold on 10 second warning
i said that and some people in the background were like [Music] all right
no networking all of april client deadline gets pushed to may 3rd
because i want you to spend a little bit more time focusing
focusing on the work that we got to get done the reading the tutorials that
we're going to do all right we also mentioned this idea of client
alternatives if you've given it the good
old 100 devs try or you're in a position
where you can't get a paid client due to
visa status or anything that might cause
you harm there are two alternatives that you may do
this is for everyone so if you if you really feel like you've given it the
whole dungeon devs try you have really exhausted all the steps we talked about

00:20
in our freelancing class here are two things that would also count
uh the first thing is volunteering for a grassroots organization
a group that is a community group that's on the ground doing great work probably
in your local area it's okay to approach them ask if they
need a web presence to see if they want to
get a website built and you can do that for no money
notice i didn't say free because it's not free but you can do it for no money
now i'm distinguishing here between like a grassroots organization and a
non-profit just because non-profits typically have some money
like some of the biggest clients i've ever worked with have been non-profits
and so a lot of more established they've been around for a while non-profits
actually do have a lot of money whereas a lot of newer kind of boots on the
ground type organizations might not have any collective funds that pay for a web

00:21
developer and could get a lot of benefit out of your services that you're
volunteering however when you volunteer your time you still do the exact
same process you still do a proposal you still do a contract
you still say that there are terms in which you are going to be paid and
how you are going to be paid is that you are asking them that when
you complete the services that they will be the best
reference customer that you have ever ever had and you put that in the
proposal you put that in the contract it's no money down but you are signing
up to be the best the best recommendation that i have ever had in my life
right and so the idea here is that this will help you when you get

00:22
into the job search because the employer
can actually talk to someone that you've worked with that you've done amazing
work for and that'll help you get past some interviews or or seal the deal on
an offer it can also help you land other paid
clients so if for some reason you're not
able to land the paid client or you have a
a situation where you're not allowed to then this could be one of the first
really big things that you could do that still helps you in the long run of
getting a job and eventually developing and getting those other clients
is it okay to skip the proposal go straight to the contract i don't think
so i want you to get practice right all of this is practice the first time do it
the traditional way after you've done a few you can see what you like what you
don't like and modify the process to your liking but get that full experience

00:23
first when employers talk to our clients they
ask if they paid us for what we built them most often not sometimes they will
and you'll just you'll just coach your your your person to say if someone asked
you did you get paid say i'm not comfortable disclosing how much we paid
so when you when they say i'm not comfortable disclosing how much i paid
that assumes that they paid but really they didn't they just don't
feel comfortable disclosing it that's the big brain plays at play right
here that's all i got to say so yeah so grassroots volunteering a-okay in my
book to satisfy the requirements of getting a client
the next thing that you can do if for some folks they can't even volunteer
depending on their situation uh and so if getting a paid client isn't a thing
and you can't do grassroots volunteering

00:24
i think this is the best the second best thing to do is the grassroots
volunteering if you can't do this the the last thing that you can do that can
be really beneficial in the job search process is
contributing to free software or open source projects
and so you would find a project that you're passionate about something that
aligns with your interest and contributes some code to that project
and the reason why this can be really helpful with the job search is that
you're going to be working with real engineers
shipping real code that makes it into real products and so when you're in an
interview and they ask like what have you built you say oh do you know x y and
z project well i did this thing for it or i i worked on this feature for this
project and you can explain the code that you've written you can see that
code live on github which we'll learn about on thursday and

00:25
once again it's one of those things that can take the the new developer stench
off of you right and so there are some ways to get started with free software
and one of the best ways to do it is this website that i have linked here on
the slides called first timers only first timers only is a collection of
projects that are super welcoming to folks that have never contributed to
free software or open source projects in the past and so you can go through you
can see the projects you can see if there are any that like
align with your interest and you'll find hopefully a community of engineers that
are welcoming and want to see you contribute for the first time and so it's um
it's a really great place to start if you know you want to contribute to free
software open source or you can also just look for projects that you're
interested in there are so many things out there that are aligned with your
interest that you could find and talk to

00:26
the organizers of that project to see if there's anything that you could add
a lot of my students get started maybe just like cleaning up documentation
doesn't even have to be necessarily code to get your feet wet it can be other
things that until you get comfortable with the project how they do things and
then work your way up to code as well so first timer only
is a great place to start but also don't be afraid to reach out to projects that
you like for example like if you like chess there's leeches it's a wonderful
community of developers that are building uh a free chess server so you
could do that right and so if you can't do a paid client or you've given it the
full 100 devs try you tried everything on that list the two alternatives are
volunteering for grassroots org but you still do the whole process or
contributing to free software cool i'm going to try and do it all hey turn up
does it have to be in javascript no but you'll probably bear maybe a little bit

00:27
better if it is javascript especially since you're going to be using your
javascript skills to apply to jobs and showing that you have built a project or
contributed in javascript can be helpful does it help to volunteer for
organizations that are like a little bit larger um it can
it's a great way of networking volunteering has always been the best
thing i have ever done for networking volunteering at conferences is how i've
made most of my adult friends uh so yeah it it it can be a great way
to meet people it can be a great way to get engaged with a local community of
engineers and that you now have a common bond between so i'm a big fan of
volunteering whether it be for like code contribution
or just like in general to some other organizations in your area
i have a client but they only do a shopify site does that count hell yeah
as long as they're paying you monies is streaming a good networking

00:28
opportunity do you think absolutely actually one of the best things you can
do to build a small community of engineers that know who you are
the only problem with um the only problem with
streaming is that it's not localized so you get a wider net which can be helpful
maybe for remote positions if you're looking for local positions that's the
only thing that's the only downside the squarespace count hell yeah they're
paying you for it outreachy is an open source internship uh for uh for folks yes
uh so if you are looking for if you are a person of color
if you're a non-traditional kind of individual coming into tech
i hate that word but if you're looking for kind of like
a good place to get started in free software outreach is a really good place
to do that what they do is they take folks that are not traditionally

00:29
represented in tech and they pair them up with really big orgs like mozilla
right or um or like any other big free software
companies and they actually pay you a stipend over the summer to work on those
projects and so it can be a great great place to start i can share that in our
follow-up after today's class on discord major league nope that's not true
there's a lot of other things that they look for as well
now there's a bunch of things that are kind of like that they fall just folks
that are not traditionally in tech cool so we have
our alternatives which are contributing to grassroots orgs

00:30
and we have contributing to free free or uh open source software check out first
timers only as a good place to get started i'll share some other folks
i'll share some other folks other places to get started as well in
the follow up today's class cool alrighty monday we are doing our live
portfolio and resume review so we got a bunch of a bunch of things that
are coming up this week uh i've asked for you to submit your portfolios and
resumes uh so monday we are going to have our
our roast session exactly uh we're gonna have a
a row session it's gonna be a a class on
monday uh it'll course it'll be recorded
if you can't make monday but like i said this is the best week ever so we're
doing something every single day of the week so
if you can't make it on monday it's okay it'll be recorded but we're gonna go

00:31
through as many folks as i can in about an hour or two looking at portfolios
looking at resumes looking at the things i think are super important to have in
in part of your portfolio in your resume and then at the end i'll share good
templates for your resume and templates for your portfolio as well right
uh youtube was a little behind i am almost caught up with youtube now uh a
lot of folks use youtube to watch the videos uh sorry i got a little behind on
them they are caught up now we our first class on objects is on there and um
you'll see the next class on objects come up uh tomorrow so the the the
youtube's always going to be a day or two behind because of our contract with
twitch but i try to get them as quickly as possible
i always appreciate folks that watch on youtube if you're watching on youtube
please give it a like that's all i ask uh it really does help the the algorithm
for more folks to find it on youtube which is always

00:32
wonderful because then more folks find out about 100 devs and they find out
about the bootcamp where they don't have to pay a lot of money
or any money at all so that's the goal uh youtube is very finicky i noticed
like if i post at the wrong time or i i miss a day or two like our numbers just
tank it's pretty wild um like the difference between like 3 000 and a
thousand is just like posting at a different time of day it's really
interesting so uh if you're on youtube please give it a
like leave a comment it really does help the algorithm and folks finding us on
youtube and also if you're just trying to watch the classes
youtube doesn't have any ads and it's easier to jump around too
alrighty newsletter uh if you're part of the newsletter you might have noticed
today uh that there was a special newsletter raffle
and so i'm gonna go ahead and take all the responses from the

00:33
newsletter raffle today and we're gonna pick a random winner and that winner
will be getting a 100 devs t-shirt that's right folks 100 devs t-shirt
coming your way for the winners of this special
newsletter raffle if you didn't if you didn't read the newsletter you didn't
open up you didn't submit the raffle too late
all right so i'm going to grab these here i love all the people doing it like
right now as a as i'm in the as i'm in it so i'm grabbing from before i set it
from before class started all right we're going to go from here up
now i'm just grabbing all the names so we can put them into the name picker

00:34
all right grab them all let's do a random name picker
boom thirteen hundred of y'all before i said it uh so let's go ahead and pick a
random name three two one boom jerkson hey thank you
for opening the newsletter uh send me a mon mail please on discord i'll send a
mod mail and we will get the we will get the t-shirt your way congratulations
see folks it pays to open the newsletter it definitely pays to open newsletters
on the best week ever imagine that uh your your newsletter was going to
junk this whole time convertkit's pretty
good about delivering the the letters uh but i would always appreciate if you

00:35
like white listed my email uh that way your uh emails always came through and
if you use gmail adding it to primary just so you always see them it really
does help for some reason those ratios in terms of deliverability really help
so i appreciate it all right the next big news we have is that well
we have stream tonight well we also have a stream tomorrow
folks and it won't be me uh i want to welcome hello it's rufio to the stream
team hold on we got a 10 second warning here we got we just got to do a quick

00:36
quick confetti i think this is appropriate for this all right [Music]
welcome welcome welcome to the stream team i'm so excited to have them um
you'll notice there is a stream team channel in the 100 dev section of our
discord members of the stream team can post
there and i will ask that you turn on notifications for that channel you can
like turn on notifications for that channel that way when folks of the
stream team go live you get a message just like you get a message from me so
we're gonna walk through that this week on how to do that but the first new
member of the stream team welcome and tomorrow
they are streaming normal time 6 30 pm they're going live and they're working
through some cold wars so many folks have been struggling with
cold wars don't know how to get started don't know how to approach the problems
and so they are going to take the time to make sure right

00:37
that you feel comfortable and you can see you can see their process right

so i'll be hanging out there tomorrow we're going to do some raffles over
there as well so you definitely want to come hang out and so tomorrow night 6 30
p.m if you want to do some code wars come hang out
and welcome to the stream team thursday sponsored stream
so not tomorrow thursday night we got a sponsor stream so tonight we have day
one of best night ever tomorrow we have hello it's rufio streaming for the first
time as part of the stream team they do amazing streams by the way just building

you'll notice that there are two resources here getting started with
github and introduction to github i want you to do the introduction to github
please that was part of your homework after you've done the video that i
shared so if you haven't yet please go ahead and take a peek at this
introduction to github before thursday's class and as always homework is a first
pass we'll always do the complicated the important bits together during stream
cool if you need that link you can do exclamation point ms in chat and it'll
give you this link if you don't have the slides pull up yeah cool
then friday we're doing friday with friends that's right folks tonight
tomorrow thursday friday we are doing friday with friends it's going to be our
first session of friday with friends friday we're friends is going to be uh

00:40
spaces we're gonna do mainly kind of uh discord spaces where you can have events
on discord we'll probably do a few on twitter as well but it's just a place
for us to bring folks that are part of the community it's a way for us to
uh bring alumni to come talk to you to bring other folks that are that want to
help and support the 100 devs community to come together so we're going to kick
off friday with friends we're gonna try and do it quite regularly uh in the
beginning and we'll see how it plays out but the idea here is that friday we're
having friday with friends 6 p.m on discord i'll share more a few surprises
to be had maybe a raffle or two i got you all right saturday
told you best week ever we got we got something every day of the week for you
if you want to be want to be here you want to be with community you want to
you want to be with us for the whole week i got you this saturday well

00:41
april 1st which is technically friday our place is coming back
for folks that don't know our place was one of reddit's open
one of reddit's april fool's pranks from i don't know like 2017 i think it was
and what it was is an all-out battle to place tiles on a map it's one of the
funnest experiences i've ever had on the internet
and since so many of us have come from reddit
i thought it'd be really fun to battle it out to hold down our place
on our place so saturday there will be a channel on
discord for folks that want to organize and try and lock down a place on our
place i think we have enough folks to do it i think we have enough folks on
reddit to do it so i think that'd be a fun project for all of us to work on
it'll be something fun come hang out we'll be in voice channels we'll be in

00:42
tech channels that will open specifically for our place here's what
it looked like last time and so you're gonna see kind of like all
these communities that came together to kind of capture uh their little slice of
place we had the blue wave that was constantly trying to take over yeah
different countries showing out different communities showing out and so
i think we could hold it down i think we could uh figure out how to uh to hold
down a little slice for 100 devs so saturday if you're looking to have some
fun you want to hang out with a bunch of your 100 devs members
come through on discord we're going to have a lot of fun and try and hold down
a spot on our place cool baby jacob congrats that's great all right
office hour sunday baby come on the best week ever we got to keep it coming we
got office hours on sunday we're going to do the thing like we normally do
have a lot of fun maybe a little bit more fun than normal
i don't know you got to check it out then monday we kind of already mentioned

00:43
it we're calling it mentor monday we are going to have a place for folks
that want to be mentors in the 100 devs community are folks that want to support
the 100 devs community we're going to start off by having a
little session on like how to help folks with portfolios and resume
reviews and then we're going to do the live portfolio and resume review so
you'll alumni you'll be getting a message from me because that's where
we'll start with mentor mondays and then we'll kind of start opening it
up to more and more folks but the idea is that we want to start building
systems and helping train folks and the things that i do every day i want to
help other folks learn how to do those things so they can support our community
as well so we're bringing mentor mondays
uh to fruition in the best week ever and then after that kind of chat session
with the alumni mentors uh we will go ahead and do a portfolio resume review
that will be live so that portfolio resume review will be live at 6 00 p.m 6

00:44
p.m i forgot to put uh 6 p.m on there yeah when is our place taking place we're
going to be having it open all weekend it's going to be uh all saturday it'll
be open uh we'll leave the channels open
and so uh you don't feel like it doesn't
be a specific time just come hang out if you want to try and hold it down
all right all this is eastern time yup alrighty and then next tuesday
is the best week ever the end hmm well it's got as the gift says there's
got to be a banger so next tuesday we're
doing it really big a lot of things that we're kind of just laying in the ground
we're for today next tuesday next tuesday's a banger cool so best week ever
we have a thing that people have been asking for

00:45
for a very long time and that is merch so i wanted to bring merch back
and we're going to start with a very very limited run i want to show you the
og merch uh that everyone has a chance to win with the raffles on thursday and
tomorrow and the rest of the week so the the og merch will be available soon now
a few of you tried to get into the chat early i saw
you throwing the the exclamation point merch into the chat you got gap
none of this stuff was live you couldn't you couldn't get it until i
uh until i pressed the magical button so it's going to sell out i think pretty
quickly uh just so everyone knows all the merch is at cost so as cheap as
i can set the metric is how cheap it is there's no profit on any of this
except for one thing every single time i do a merch drop i

00:46
have one thing that has the max profit and that max profit item
is always something that comes along with the only fans match
so the max profit item always has an only fans match
um and so i got to get paid for my only fans and so
it's like i think it's like a 20 buck profit or something like that it's
always supposed to be a joke but somebody always buys it uh so it's know
that it's a joke i don't want you to buy it but if you do when the first person
reaches only fans you get only fans too that's right folks it's how you get it
the only way in you get a million channel points or you buy the the only
fans match so nothing showing up yet because i haven't clicked the magical
buttons but i can go ahead and click those buttons now so let's go ahead and
boom and boom there we go uh the merch should be live you can do
exclamation point merch and uh stuff will come through you might

00:47
have to give it a little bit of a a refresh and then you'll see it come live
oh boy they're off to the to the races here um
i'm gonna pull up my merch panel here just so i can i can see it
make sure everything's working and go to the store oh yeah
it's live folks it's live [Laughter] i can bring it on to the window here uh
you can see the the the the three lovely items that are up
we have uh first and foremost uh the uh special cut of the
uh engineering v1 and then we have the the another kind of cut of the

00:48
engineering v1 uh they're limited quantities of both and uh there's only one
only fans match and so that that's super limited and
looks like we're good all right i think it should be live all right there we go
alrighty folks have fun if that's what you want and that's what we'll be giving
away for the raffles this week let me pull it up real quick this is what i'll
be giving away for the raffles this week uh the the regular kind of two t-shirts
whenever you win a raffle you'll get to pick
you'll get to pick either one of these cuts whatever you like and that'll be
coming your way if you're getting server errors i'm pretty sure that they sold

00:49
out but don't worry don't worry remember i said tuesday would be a banger
so there will be a lot more merch on tuesday as well some other fun things
these are the og ones that i wanted folks to see and
so they knew what they were getting with the raffles this week
i think some folks found the donation page hey thank you for the donors i
appreciate you already we did merch and the last thing i want to do
uh the best week ever would not be our best week ever
without thanking a lot of people uh-oh i forgot to turn up that sound off
well if you bought merch i think you're you're about to pop up here
sold out faster than the ps5 yeah there wasn't that oh
there wasn't that many that were that were available
and weren't that many that were available

00:50
i wanted to do a test run real quick to make sure it still worked and to for
folks to see what was coming up with the raffles
but i'm pretty sure they they sold out like in two seconds but that's all right
tuesday we're gonna do another drop tuesday we'll do another drop but like i
said it wouldn't be the best week ever without thanking a lot of people
jason derulo hey thank you for the gift it subs and so
throughout the best week ever i am going to do my best
to thank some folks that are amazing contributors to this community
uh that have shown up for us time and time again not not right now not right
now but i want to give them a special place in each of these places that we
meet this week so this week we have all these events we have an
event tonight tomorrow thursday friday saturday sunday monday and next tuesday
and so over this time there are some really important

00:51
people that i want to thank and so each each day you're going to see me
highlight somebody different that has been an amazing part of this community
and i think that's really important for us to to do so when you see them get
shouted out give them some love give them some praise because they they
absolutely deserve it um but before we kind of get into the rest
of the night i also want to thank every single one of you um
this has been an amazing ride nobody has ever done what we've been
able to do this many folks all learning to code at the same time supporting each
other building each other up making sure that we all get to the finish line
at the scale has never ever been done and so thank you for helping build what is
hands down the best community to learn how to code live online right now hands
down you go on our discord at any time of the day there are folks answering
questions there are folks in discord channels i could have never guessed a

00:52
little over a year ago that this is what would become of just a few classes on
twitch so huge huge thank you to every single
person that comes up that comes every single class that
puts in the work when things get hard that doesn't give up on themselves when
the things aren't sinking in gives me the trust to know that we'll figure out
how to get there together that like stuff that retweets stuff that
helps other folks that are hurting and could use this opportunity to find us
i know it seems really silly but when you thumbs up stuff on youtube or you
retweet stuff on twitter that helps more folks find us
that's folks that don't have to splash out big bucks for a boot camp that can
join the catch-up crew or learn at their
own pace and have the support of a super strong community that helped them make
it to the end and so for every single person that's ever done anything

00:53
that shows up that likes that retweets that does even those those things that
you think might be small but have a huge impact i am overwhelmingly thankful so
thank you to each and every single person that shows up and as we go
throughout this week i'm going to take time to thank these folks that have
helped build this community over the last year cool everybody
we are at the top of the hour this is the best week ever i know i had to take
a little time to do all these things but what what uh what a good start to the
best week ever we got some amazing merch we got some amazing events all
throughout this entire week let's go ahead and bring our timer up
remember we got to be healthy even even during the best week ever we got to be
healthy let's go ahead and bring up our timer please if you're able get up move
around hydrate kiss some babies play with some dogs
and when we come back in five minutes we're gonna jump into our review we're

00:54
gonna review a little bit of everything a little bit of a raise a little bit of
objects start to have some fun and then uh we'll
take it from there all right folks five minutes on the timer you got this i'm

00:58
gonna run some ads to actually take a break i'll see you in 5. um do

00:59
retro we are a 30 week software engineering bootcamp
all right folks 10 seconds then we're back negative 10 shirts ghosts that's
hilarious have these alerts been coming in while we're on break
what i think of web though i think it's a cool tool to have in your tool belt
[Music] yeah they have all right welcome back folks let's jump into this
let's get some review on alrighty i'm going to chill those alerts

01:00
i'm pretty sure they're probably pretty loud all right there you go
there you go i think the alert should be done
already folks let's jump into it let's get into our review this evening
all right programming what is a program a program is a what
chat give it to me what's a program set of instructions
so the act of programming is simply writing those instructions in a language the
computer can understand the language that we choose is javascript
because we can learn one language use it on the front end and in just a couple
classes use it on the back end too it's highly in demand
and it's something that we can use to communicate our ideas to each other
beautiful all right we learned about variables variables are a way of storing

01:01
a value into memory to be used later on we can do both declaration and
assignment at the same time there are a lot of new folks here tonight if you're
new this is going to be a very quick review we're on class 23 you can always
join our discord exclamation point discord get all the materials you need if you
want to follow along today or join our catch-up crew and follow along your own
pace until you can join us live already we learned about conditionals where we
check to see if something is true if it's true we do what's inside the curly
braces otherwise we move on to an else if we check to see if what's true is
there if it is we do what's inside the curly braces if not we move on to the
else the else does not have a condition it automatically runs if nothing else
above it was true you can have as many l-stiffs as you would like
we can always have multiple conditions as well separated by the double
ampersand if your name is leon and your status is ballin it's the best week ever

01:02
so you bet i am you get a wink at the camera alrighty we can also have or
study time hey thank you for the raid it's been a minute how have you been
we got to get folks coming your way hold on that's that's cool we haven't
seen you in a minute hope you're doing well let me do a shout out here
uh study time is one of the best folks to be following if you're going through
this boot camp and you're not following study time you have to
uh and i'll explain why in a second let's see if i can do this here
there we go all right we got the shout out
let me see if i can just copy and paste that a bizillion times because there's
so many folks here boom it's going to copy and paste it

01:03
there you go you have to give them a follow go ahead and give them a follow
beautiful so uh study time amazing pomodoro sessions where you can get
actual work done super chill super relaxed if you haven't please give them
a follow i i'm lurking in there quite often when
i need to get stuff done i'm hanging out there uh so if you haven't go ahead and
give study time and follow thank you for the raid hope you're doing well
hope your stream went well today i hope you already get stuff done welcome
all right we gotta uh i'll send you a whisper we
gotta get folks we gotta figure out a raid we gotta figure out the timing
right so we can get more folks to come over your way because i feel like a lot
of folks in our community uh could could benefit from your streams so we'll make
we'll figure out how to make that happen all right we also have multiple
conditions for those that are actually coming over that are new we're doing a

01:04
free 30-week software engineering bootcamp here live on twitch and so
we're just getting some quick review of some of the topics that we've already
covered so far all right all righty so multiple conditions we
have day equals saturday or day equals sunday if it's saturday or sunday we
will see it is the weekend functions what are functions chat
give me what is the function please set of instructions exactly
set of instructions simply a set of instructions
the set of instructions are reusable and they become the building blocks of our
programs we can separate out these functions into individual
pieces and use them as needed we have our function declaration and our

01:05
function call whenever we call we call to argue we pass in our arguments and
they fall into our parameters wherever we see the parameter it's the values
that were passed in an example is when we call the function yell we pass in the
argument of hello wherever i see word it
is indeed hello and we would alert hello wonderful loops chat with our loops
yeah whenever we need to do something multiple times we can use a loop it's
just a repeating in action multiple times there are a couple kind of main
loops that we started with like for and while
i've seen a bunch of other loops now specifically due to methods that are
tied to arrays we saw four reach we saw map we saw reduced all these things that
are looping through and doing something multiple times i love it

01:06
for loops we start with our counter we say when our loop stops and how much our
counter goes up by each time so this would console log all the numbers from
one to four because by the time we got to five this is no longer true
alrighty we got some review in let's do a turbo review
you're gonna notice some of the questions look a little familiar
i know some of the questions look a little familiar
so go ahead and open up turbo review if you don't have the starter code for
today make sure you join our discord exclamation point discord agree to the
rules and then the following materials channel you'll find the zip file for
today in that zip file you'll find the turbo review
there are some variable questions some function questions and it looks like
these uh function conditional loops might be a little
similar get them done get your active recalling get your space repetition in
and we're gonna put uh here come the flexosaurus

01:07
let's let's put uh let's put let's put a a a solid eight on the clock
solid eight in the clock now let's do seven let's keep it spicy
let's keep it spicy don't copy and paste do it from scratch
i see you no way you typed that fast get out of here
all right folks seven minutes on the clock you got this
blah added two more minutes thank you blah so this becomes a nine minute timer
all right nine minutes on the clock folks have at it you got this thank you
you got this dig in try your best give it the old 100 devs try
some of these variables and um function questions they're gonna they're gonna
you're gonna need to maybe google some stuff to figure out how to do it because
we might not have covered those methods yet so
for folks that are kind that have done the turbo review before there are some

01:08
different questions here oh island sometimes
do we have to use conditionals uh no not if you don't want to you can figure out
other ways go for it looks like i'm sipping wine no i promise
you it's just it's just water and some some berries
man these merch alerts still coming through
thank you everyone that bought the merch

01:09
that's pretty cool i'm really excited to see y'all rep 100 devs og merch
would it code i open up a um slido for the for the clips
law that's called bomber's peak yeah there's like a certain level of
intoxication where it helps the coating and then an immediate drop where it no
longer helps yeah neurologic is long as cheap as
they'll let me sell them is what i sell them at there's no profit on any of them
charlie said will you restock absolutely we'll um wait did study time rate again
how's that possible did you go live then come back
or is that or is this the alert just coming through now
the alert not come through i guess because of all the merch um alerts

01:10
show us study time again definitely need to hang out there if you're not already
how do you feel github co-pilot bad idea to use if you're just learning yeah i
think in the beginning try and do things that make you have to learn the syntax
and then as you get comfortable with a language then you can use tools like
that for sure that merge should have worked for anyone
we've had folks from all over the world be able to get the merge through that
link so um i'll double check to make sure
there's no settings in mind or anything like that but it should have worked for
other any folks i think it just sold out really really quick
ours no keep keep following through um you there's there's the newer videos of

01:11
cohort 2. i might use those instead of the other cohort um just so that you're a
little bit closer to what we're doing this this year
um and join the catch-up crew on discord get through get caught up and then join
us live except for office hours um office hours i think you should still
come through oh and for folks i'll mention this again
when we're back i know folks mute me during the work time but uh i know that
everybody can afford to buy merch i try to make as cheap as possible it's ten
dollars for the t-shirt but um i know that that's not a privilege everyone has
and so uh for all the swag that microsoft gives i match with like random
giveaways for for swag so hopefully there's a chance you to get a shirt too
if you really want one what if we can't attend every stream

01:12
this week you don't have to it's just for us to have some time to celebrate
come as you can don't worry about making them all i know
a lot of folks have other commitments in life and jobs and so yeah no it's just
just for us to have some fun it's not it's not something you have to commit to
what's wednesday it's hello it's rufio's first stream as part of the stream team

01:13
i got you dab it'll be on their own yep it'll be on their own
can we win the laptop if we aren't in the us yes i ship anywhere in fact
it was like probably like a month ago i just started getting back merch that i
sent last year like i like i had shipped out some stuff
and it just didn't make it like i sent it to some some places that
i mean it was it was a crap shoot if it was gonna make it there but we tried
um and they got they got returned unfortunately for some places but i'll try
i'll try to ship it anywhere i can uh yeah they'll hear back from mod mail
we're we'll probably won't be responding about like raffles until the end of the
best week ever because there'll be so many and then on like wednesday of next
week i'm just going to go through and set up everything so that way i can ship
everything out yeah you'll hear back from me probably

01:14
like next wednesday if you win something like at any point this week
can't do the first question that's okay this is i don't know i should be able to
know how to code this these first two questions were
more you googling than you knowing how to solve something cloth that's awesome
yeah these first two ones are not things that you should know is something that

01:15
you'd google to figure out three you can do exclamation point
semicolon in chat and you can read about all about it
it's with the first time chat just to drop the dunzo on us i love it that's
how you use your first time uh highlight we learned docker some folks might pick
it up based on like if they do free software
projects but it's not something that we'll go deep on or like really cover in
class or something that you might pick up on your on the job
funk ketchup and then join us live once you're caught up

01:16
oh one yeah we sold out within like a minute
yeah i use docker all the time i love it
alrighty folks come on back come on back so yeah you're eligible if you come to
you got to be in the class though thank you sammy
all right come on back folks let's go over this together
but let's look at some of the new ones and we'll get the review together as
well uh will friday's best ever be recorded yeah everything that we can
record will record yeah and we'll at least share it on discord cool

01:17
already declare a variable and assign it to a sentence as a string alert if that
sentence is a question um how do we know if a sentence is a question
first of all yeah it ends in the question mark so
we would need to figure out whether or not our string ends
with a question mark so what did you all figure out you could use with strings
to figure out if a string ends with a question mark
includes could work uh some folks found ends with yeah that's what i think i
would use uh so if you give it to google you might
have come across with ends with so let's create a string uh
const because this is never going to change uh let's say
it's just going to call it a string we're going to say is this the best week

01:18
ever oh yeah and so what we can do is we can alert if the sentence is a
question because we can just go ahead and alert
and we can pop in here straw ends with and we can just pass in the question
mark so if this ends with a question mark right
if this ends with a question mark what do you think we get
let's go ahead and let's go and save this and see if it works first
open it in the browser all right we get true boom we get true
so we know oh yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah let's go beautiful all right thank you

01:19
yeah those turbo fits are digging that oh yeah all right so we did get true
and so what do you know ends with returned what did it return
yeah return that that true or false value and then we simply just alerted
that true or false so we know that our string was a question because it ends
with a question mark now there's no way that you would know this
unless you had read it in some readings or had
maybe come across it on the mdn this is something that you had to google right
oh because it's a function exactly it's a function we're passing this in what i
have highlighted right here is technically a what

01:20
what i have highlighted is a what it's an argument like if i was to break
it down this is a method on a string but right now we're passing in that
method on the string in as an argument to the alert method right pretty cool
but i think there are some folks that are like that they're like there's no
way i can figure this out ah they just you just had to google and so getting
better at googling getting over that initial
there's like that thing in our brain that goes i don't know how to do this i
don't know how to do this i don't know how to do this i can't do it i don't
know how to do it i'll never forget i can't do it i can't do it i can't do it
can do it [Laughter] you got it you got to figure out how to turn that off
this had nothing to do with your ability to code javascript
this had nothing to do with how how much you understand this was all google
and so sometimes we have to turn off that thing in our brain that says we
can't do it i don't know where to get started i don't know what to do

01:21
and just freaking google it well i said i just spent 3.5 work days
googling various things to untangle a bug days and it's okay exactly this is
what you do on the job you sit down you
go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i have no idea how i'm going to solve this
and then you google your ass off for three three and a half days like blah
just did that's being an engineer so when you get a question that you just
have no idea you gotta fight that feeling that thing that says you can't
figure it out and just google it and spend time developing that skill set
because what you're gonna do on the job and it gets better the more you do it
all right declare a variable assign it a string
of multiple words replace every junior dev with software engineer and print it

01:22
to the console all right let's string equal i am looking for junior dev
uh positions there we go i am looking for junior dev positions nah
now what we do is not what we do all right cool so let's go ahead
what could i do to replace every mention of junior dev
replace that could work maybe once though replace all yeah let's go and do
replace all so we need to print it to the console so we'll do our console log
and then inside of our console log we are going to do string

01:23
or straw and we'll do replace all and then replace all takes in two values
it takes the thing that you want to replace so in this case it'll be junior
dev we gotta make sure the spacing is correct and we're gonna place it with
software engineering all right so what this will do is it'll
replace every junior dev with software engineering let's go ahead and save this
all right let's save this and let's open up the inspector
and let's go ahead and refresh uncaught syntax there stra has already
been declared happened it's saved what happened
yeah we've already declared a variable called stra

01:24
and it's a con so there's no way that we could even override it down here
we're never changing our string to be that we're looking for junior def
positions get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here where
have you been if you thought this was what we were going to leave it as so we
we got to use a different name let's let's do string to change
there we go string to change so i get a little excited every once in a while
it's the best week ever string to change and we're going to replace it all so
let's save it let's go back let's refresh true and i am looking for software
engineering positions let's go turn up we got this second try all right next one
this is where it kind of gets similar we've kind of seen these next three
questions already but that's okay let's take some time and go through them

01:25
blunder no alrighty create a function that returns rock
paper scissors as randomly as possible so what are some things we're going to
need to to do this randomly what are some tools we're going to need
to generate rock paper scissors randomly oh yeah when it gets to the bottom
that's when you know you're doing good match.random exactly all right so let's
go ahead and we know we're going to create a function
that returns rock paper scissors so i'm just going to call this function rock
paper scissors and we're going to return either rock
paper scissors but before we do that let's go ahead and create a variable
that'll hold our random number so let's say let random
equal and we'll do math.random and math.random in case you forget

01:26
returns a number between zero and one so
we're going to get a decimal some number between zero and one and so if we want
to do it equal values we'll do a conditional and we'll say if random
is less than what 0.33 exactly if it's less than 0.33
let's go ahead and return rock we'll return a string of rock uh elsif else if
if uh random is less than 0.66 we will return paper
beautiful and if it wasn't less than 0.33 or less than 0.66 the only other
thing it can be the only other thing it could be would

01:27
be greater than 0.66 so we can just do an else and in that case we'll return
scissors beautiful great so now we have a function that we can
call that will return rock paper or scissors wonderful
create a function that takes in a choice that takes in a choice
could you use fractions of decimals probably yeah
just make sure you and you you use your parentheses to keep it separated
could you make it into an arrow function you could but i think this would be way
more readable the way it is yeah i like the readability of this all right
so let's do the next one here create a function that takes in a choice
rock paper scissors and determines if you want a game of rock paper scissors
against a bot using the above function so we're going to create a function that

01:28
is going to take in a choice that we use and then compare it to the choice that
the bot generates using this function above so i'm going to go here and
create a function i'm going to call it uh check win
and we know that we're taking in player choice
right that the choice that the player is going to pick and the very first thing
we have to do is get the bot choice i'm going to set bot choice equal to calling
rock paper scissors so what's going to happen is the very first time well the
very first thing this function is going to do is run
the function we have up here and we know that this function right
we know that this function can spit out rock
paper or scissors so there is an equal chance

01:29
that this will wind up being either rock paper or scissors so any any
there we go anywhere else we see bot choice anywhere else we see bot choice
we know that it's going to be either rock paper or scissors
that's how you spell scissors by the way cool
so now we got the bot choice we have to do our comparison so we'll do our first
conditional and we're just going to compare like the the choice of the player
to the choice of the bot and so if the player choice equals rock and
the bot choice equals what i want this to be winning
conditions so what would bot choice have to be for us to win this very first

01:30
scenario i'm going to put this in parentheses just to be a little safer here
yeah it would have to be scissors all right so player choice with the rock
bot choice of throw scissors that is a win condition now we can check for some
other win conditions using ore so if this is true or
i'm going to copy and paste it actually or this is true so if the player threw
let's say scissors and the bot choice through what if they
threw if bot choice it would have to throw what to to for this to be a
winning throw paper oh y'all violet that would have been funny if i thought

01:31
about it in the moment but i didn't all right scissors paper
scissors paper and we we have one more or
so if this was true or this was true or this was true uh player choice equals
paper they would have had to have chosen bot would have had a chosen rock great
so in this case this case we now have all of our winning
conditions if they if the player chose rock and bot chose scissors we win if
player chose scissors and bot choice was paper we win if player choice was paper
and they threw rock we win so we have our three
winning conditions separated by or and so in this case we would just maybe log
to the console winner here we go win a winner chicken dinner
beautiful then we can do an elsif and in our elsa if we can check for a tie

01:32
and check for a tie would be a tie how how would we determine the tie throw it
in chat for me how would we return determine the cha the try
yep if player choice equals bot choice player choice equals
bot choice beautiful so player choice equals bot choice and we can console log
tide and then if if you didn't win you didn't
lose the only other thing that you could have happened
sorry if you won or if you didn't win if
you didn't tie the only thing that could have happened is that you you lost
there we go cool so we have the bot choice being
determined by our function up here which is returning rock paper scissors

01:33
we now have the ability to randomly see if we win tie or lose
and then we can call it so the name of this function is check win
so we can throw in statistically you should always throw paper
like if you're picking a choice you should you should throw paper most
people throw rock the first time yeah it's like it's like 60 to 70
percent people throw rock the first time and so you should all you statistically
should throw paper the first time got you now you know alrighty
so we have our check win let's go ahead and make sure the code looks good i'm
going to give you a second to look at this rock paper scissors looks good
look at the check win see if it looks good because we're gonna do a a little
yolo my friends a little yolo here let's go into yolo all right

01:34
let's just make sure it's working first let's comment out this other stuff up
here just so we don't have to um deal with that boom
boom save it let's come back let's refresh these power rangers photos are lit
all right so we got a loser we got a winner got a winner we got a tide so it's
working you saw the code you might there
might be some discrepancies i don't know i mean i wrote some bad codes and maybe
sway the options here so let's go and set up a yolo let's start a prediction
are we going to win or lose win or lose commission period is one minute
and start the prediction we win or lose if it's a tie we run it again

01:35
all right get in here if you want to get in here win or lose yolo those points
get your predictions in people throwing around big points got this
a million channel points already up wow we might have a mill on each side
a milli millie amelia milly yeah y'all throwing out tonight i see you wow
1.6 million on each side in terms of channel points there's no timer right now
king's og a thank you for the hydration cheers to you yo i mean there's no timer

01:36
next timer we'll do another we'll do we'll add two minutes though
all right you ready folks for all the marbles three two
wait a minute actually let me tell let me talk about something for a second so
all right three two it's going to get loud after after
this wins right i'm gonna get loud after this wins so three two

01:37
one losers win it [Music] way to go way to go let's confirm it losers have it
complete the prediction you got your points
oh boy let's see whoa it was 2 million on each side
2 million on each side 2.1 million for winning and 2.1 million put up for losing
and sour sprite i think got 97 000 they spent 97 i can't do any more yolos
that's it we're done am i at the end stream they put out 97 000 in one

01:38
that's it that's the last yellow we're done someone also lost a lot too
oh that's wild that's wild all right and then i always love that like
this is like the most like wholesome gambling ever because as soon as someone
wins they immediately spend it on like resume reviews portfolio reviews so like
[Laughter] would it code as soon as they won their yolo boom resume review
what a rush [Laughter] [Music] i love it uh would it code send me a mod
mail please we'll set it up you're all the best all right let's keep pushing
uh we will skip the the loop we already did that together um we'll come come to

01:39
office hours we'll do more of the loops and fun stuff on um office hours
all right turbo review done erase chat what are arrays one more
uh maybe maybe we'll we'll see we gotta this is the best week ever we got a long
we got a long week folks we gotta say some of the yolo love to go around
arrays are indeed toasters exactly toasters well done i always hope that
new people join us right as we get to this thing what are arrays toasters
all right arrays are like toasters it's one element or one structure
that can hold a bunch of other stuff alrighty
the tricky thing about our arrays is they start counting
right they start counting with zero so the first element in the array is at the

01:40
zeroth index we can create new arrays using this
array constructor which maybe makes a little bit more sense now we have the
special new keyword and this array what can you tell me about this array
this is this is really important we haven't talked about this yet
but we know the new keyword is used to help us create what so far
the other places might pop up but so far we know the new keyword helps us create
what helps us create new objects and if we look at this what do we know this is
just by looking at it what is it it's a constructor function how do i
know it's a constructor function because
the first letter is capitalized so built into javascript isn't a there isn't a
way to create a new array using the built-in array constructor

01:41
which spits out an object that's an array that's some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ain't it
that's that's that's that right there once this stuff starts clicking man i
love me some javascript jb donna who a thank you for the gift it subs i
appreciate it thank you for being here so we saw new only in one place
we saw new when we were using our constructors to spit out objects and
we'll see that again in a few seconds but we only saw new when we were
creating um when we were creating objects so when we
see this new keyword we should be like all right as much as we know right now
it's used to create an object and we saw it whenever it was combined with a
constructor function right whenever it's created with
constructor function and we know that this is a constructor function because
it follows the nomenclature that is to have a capital letter a

01:42
right so right now we can see that this is a constructor function that's going
to spit out an object that has all the properties and methods that enable it to
be an array so when we create a new array object
what properties does this object have what does new array now have what are
some properties that it could have
length holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what are some methods you could have for each map
holy crap that means somewhere built into javascript is a constructor
function that's giving it the length property that's giving it the 4-h that's
giving it the map that's giving all that stuff like if we could go and like look
at the javascript source code what you can do
you would see that they're out of this constructor function is setting up
length is setting up for each it's setting up map it's setting up reduce

01:43
it's setting up all those things that we're using all right
or we could just use little notation who wrote all that
a lot of people over the years the joke is that javascript was written
in 10 days and then it had a lot a lot of time to mature after that
when we're declaring arrays we can pass in values right we could have
any type of value that we've learned about so far we can have strings
booleans numbers even other arrays can go in there what
seclusion hey thank you for the 10 gifted subs that's wild
thank you so much thank you for being here
thank you everybody for all the subs and and bits and all that fun stuff tonight
i appreciate you all thank you hey appreciate it seclusion all right

01:44
arrays start counting at zero is the best week ever a turnout
array index we start at zero so if we wanted the new york city out of this
array we have to use the zeroth index that's how we could grab the first
element by the index of zero cool we can also get stuff out of the array
using the index and we can also put stuff into the array using the index
if you're new around here folks we're going through this quick this is meant
to be a lot of review we can also use those properties that
come with our arrays like length a length will give us the total number of
elements in the array in this case if we looked at best colors
and we used the length property we'd get
four so down here best colors dot length that's actually four
we can loop through our array pulling out each color using an index
the very first time this runs i would be zero we grab green one for blue two for

01:45
yellow three four black beautiful we can even use built-in methods that
come with our arrays like for each we're usually going to run once for each
element in our array so this case it would grab green and zero blue and one
yellow and two black and three we could pass it into this arrow function
wherever we see x it actually would be green then blue then yellow then black
beautiful cool space review let's pull it up folks let's pull it up space
review take a look alrighty so with our space review you
got some things to do here with a raise some of these should look really
familiar should look really familiar let's put five minutes on the clock and
who gave us yomi two gave us an extra two minutes so

01:46
we're gonna put seven minutes on the clock thanks to yomi ii get as far and
as fast as you can we'll go over it together and then we'll take our break
when we come back we look at objects we spend more time with objects and
hopefully get to arrays sorry get to apis all right so we had five we'll make
it seven let me stop the timer as far as you can
this should if you've already done this you've already solved this great do it
again see how fast you can get it if you're if you're struggling with it
great do it again see how far you can get ten minutes on the clock go for it
this is space review space review we'll go over it together and then we
will take our break if you did it once before try doing it
with arrow functions try spicing it up a little bit

01:47
time is flying yeah when time flies we're having fun folks
move the clock down i got you there we go after the break gets objects and then
objects will lead us into the apis jb donohue a thank you for the 1800 bits
that's wild thank you so much doing too much i appreciate you thank you for the
get the subs thank you for the bits thank you for being here

01:48
honda how many how many channel points do you have hey [Laughter] [Music]
flew too close to the sun eh hundred dev speedo uh we did a hundred
des bikini i don't know if there is a speedo on um
streamlabs merch but i would be open to it if there was
man i gotta start practicing smash brothers and stuff now that

01:49
people are getting closer oh honda you're one yolo away do you risk it all
i actually got to set it up now i gotta say i don't even think it's set up right
now um so i'll set it up i'm gonna go make sure it'll be set up before uh
before uh thursday in case folks do hit it [Laughter]
you're the one that got it right yeah i'm glad you enjoy it
i never really played halo that much the whole the whole idea of like shields
is kind of odd to me coming from cs sour spray hey they give it a 10 gift of

01:50
sauce thank you so much for being here i appreciate you
vladie yes we'll be announcing all that stuff this week during the best week
ever kangaroo not yet no time no time three minutes left on the clock folks
first try the second question without looking a there you go turn up excuse me
done code words helped a lot with this awesome good to hear

01:51
first time done before the timer code that's awesome congrats
these are code words questions they are intent [Laughter] shuffle a
even in the skies that's awesome thank you for being here
we don't get got even in the air got some dunzo's coming in that's good to see

01:52
what lady nozilla hey thank you for the gift
itself thank you so much for being here probably evo butter review
looked at the first one felt the answer hell yeah
is it a bad thing if i knew exactly how to do these on tuesday but forget now
not necessarily bad but definitely a good reminder that you
might need to do a little bit more enkei and a little bit more active recall
after class i know after class we do a raid um but you definitely want to make
sure you get a little bit of reviewing before you kind of shut the books for

01:53
the evening um lou whenever somebody says they
struggle with maths i ask them first are they studying right do you use active
recall to use space repetition have you applied that to learning math because if
you haven't it's probably not your aptitude of math which almost it never
is but more so your study habits start there is it bad if my brain shuts down
sometimes no that's what that's that's what it's such
a good good thing to bring up um everybody has levels that they can
actually focus and a lot of folks jump in learning how to code
thinking that they can do 10 hour days and and and just no
we all have a different amount that we can focus and getting comfortable with
that and then slowly pushing it up is what the name of the game is and so

01:54
like for me like i shared my story before i started off with stuff that was
wild one minute on 59 minutes off because that's just where my attention
span was and i worked at it i pushed it and it got up to the point where i feel
like i can focus or good blocks of time but i'm still i still feel most
comfortable at like 45 15. i'm not even doing like full hour do 45 minutes on 15
off is like where i feel like when i'm having a good day that's right that's
where my peak hits all right folks come back let's do this together
then we'll take our break alrighty create a rave number sum all
the numbers alert the sum all right let nums equal uh 10 20 30. cool 10 20 30
and then we'll skip one and go straight to 50. beautiful
sum all the numbers alert the sum what are some ways that we could sum all

01:55
these numbers what are some ways that we could sum all these numbers
we could reduce so maybe we do an alert and in that alert we do nums dot reduce
and then inside that reduce we know that we have an accumulator and a current
value and we know that we can add to that accumulator the current value
and always for safety we throw in the zero cool
let's save this and see if it works did i open it i didn't open it
all right we got 110 in the alert hell yeah y'all that black range is lit

01:56
there we go beautiful all right let's make sure that was the first try
yeah 10 20 30 at 60 60 plus 50 is 110 for straight cool
so let's see what let's talk about what's happening here
we know that we're inside of the alert all right the alert opens and closes
here so all this stuff here is going to reduce down to a singular number that we
now know as 110 right we know that that is 110.
and so what's happening when reduce is running
reduce is a method that only works on a what chat reduce only runs on a what
chat what does reduce only run on as far as we know yes an array
so we can see that nums is our array so we know that reduce
is going to use the values that are inside of our nums array

01:57
and what reduce is going to do is it's going to run once for each
element in the array so we have four elements in our array so reduce
is going to run 4 times each time it runs we're going to grab
the value and plop it into the current value
but first current value is going to be 10
then it'll be 20 then it'll be 30. then it'll be 50. we're just pulling the
values out of this array passing it through our parameter of c
wherever we see it's the current value and all we're doing with reduce in this
instance is taking that current value and in this case
adding it to the accumulator so accumulator goes from 10 to 30 to 60

01:58
to 110 because what we're doing is adding each of these values to that
accumulation right we're just we're just adding it to
the pile that's all we're doing we're adding it onto this pile of numbers
and so eventually this reduced all the way down to a singular number
that was 110 and since we were inside of the alert we saw the 110 get alerted
cool there are other ways we could have done
this we had like a for loop that added to a sum and then alerted it but reduces
the the easiest hearing something we've seen and we definitely want to get
practice uh with these methods now something that kind of bugs some folks
sometimes is that they think that this a
c c and c are built in no these are just parameters we could call these whatever

01:59
we want robot and dino right it just doesn't matter
it's still always going to be the first parameter is always going to
be our accumulation when we're using reduce
and the second parameter is always going
to be our current value when we're using
reduce so it doesn't matter what we call
them it's just the fact that since we're using reduce
robot's going to be the accumulation and
dyno is going to be the current value it just doesn't matter what what we do
when would you not want the initial value to be zero if you're multiplying
right if you're multiplying you wouldn't want it to be
set to zero the zero doesn't actually need to be here right now
the zero helps when you're worried about types so let's say this wasn't a
number but instead of string the zero is going to tell the accumulation to start

02:00
off as a number and not a string so that we don't concatenate we just
actually do the addition cool but this would still work even without it
beautiful we get the 110. all right next one
create a function that takes in an array of numbers
return a new array of numbers that is every original number
squared uh so whenever we know we need to return a new array
right whenever we want to return a new array what do we need
yeah map is the map is the way let's go ahead and create a new array
and set it equal to let's just use our nums from above let me just do nums.map
and all we're going to do is we're going to take in each number and

02:01
it says square it so we'll do num equals num and then we can just square it by
doing what how can we square number could do math.pal that's one way what
else could we do num times num that's another way to do
it uh we could also do this too that's another shorthand way of squaring
right so we could do num times num that would be the probably the clearest way
but there are other some other shortcuts like that that would also square
you could also do um math.pal yeah we're not doing square root we're doing
square which is different cool all right and let's just see what that would be
110 and then oh do i have was it was it console logged
oh no i didn't do anything with it did it say to do anything

02:02
it does say to return it so we could do it as an inside of an arrow function
if we wanted to let me say just like numbs oops sorry not here
there we go beautiful so now what we're doing is we have this set up as an arrow
function because this right hand side has a what this right hand side has a what
yeah it has an implicit return yep has an implicit return meaning that
it's just going to return that that bit cool alrighty
this should have been kind of stuff we saw last class
definitely make sure you're getting this
review in so that way when you see these things for the second time you might
know how to approach it all right next one create a function that takes a string

02:03
print the reverse of that string to the console what could we do
n ends uh astrix actually two is just another way of squaring it's just
something built into javascript that can also help you square
yeah we saw how to reverse last time split reverse join
split reverse join split reverse joint split reverse join split reverse join
split reverse join is how we reverse a string that should be in your anki you
should you should be able to spit it out whenever you need
all right create a function that takes in a string
print the reverse of that string so let's say uno reverse equals
we're going to take in a string and we are going to console.log that string

02:04
split reverse join beautiful there we go what split does is it takes the string
and turns it into a what howdy sand turns it into an array
once we have the array reverse can reverse each in this case we split it
into individual letters reverse can take those individual
letters and it can reverse them and then once we reversed our array we
join it back together to get back a what to get back a string exactly otherwise
we'd still be dealing with an array we want that string back why does
uh reverse not need quotes because when they made the reverse method they didn't
need it to take in an argument to do the reversing so we don't need to pass
anything in splitting needs to know how you're splitting up the string are you
splitting it into individual letters are you splitting it based on a delimiter
like a space or a comma same thing we're joined how are we joining it back

02:05
together we're joining all the letters back together are we joining them with
spaces et cetera et cetera alrighty create a function that takes in a string
alert if the string is a palindrome or not how could i do this create a function
that takes in a string alert if it's a palindrome or not
what am i going to do here what am i going to compare yeah cool so
let's do const palindrome check equals we're going to take in a string
and we're going to see if that string equals that string split reverse almost

02:06
join there we go we know we're going to take in a string
we're going to see if it equals uh the same as that reversed and we're
going to throw this into an alert so we get the alert beautiful so if the string
equals the string reversed what do we know that we have
if the string equals the string reversed what do we know that we have
we have a palindrome exactly and so this case it would evaluate to true and we
would alert true if um if this was not the same backwards
and forwards we would get false and would alert false so let's save this
let's go ahead and call our palindrome check and let's pass in race car

02:07
let's save it let's go ahead and refresh
and we get true we see true gets printed sorry alert it because race car is
indeed a palindrome is it bad practice to use
luna reverse we could use a reverse in here
we could we could call uno reverse with string we could do that we could do uno
[Music] reverse and pass in passive string as a as an argument
but we would have to get rid of the console log here
because we want it to return we need it to be a return
not a console log if we're going to do that so let's save it
see if it still works and we still get true so it's still working
so what happened here let's let's do this together we have our function call

02:08
we're gonna pass racecar and is an argument into our string
wherever we see string it is now racecar right wherever we see string it is now
race car and so we passed race car into our uno reverse function
which is going to have an implicit return of race car but in this case race car
will be reversed and so now we can compare the string we passed in
with the reverse of the string using the function we did up here
this is the beauty of building out functions that do singular things
because we can start to reuse them in other parts of our code so now whenever
we want to reverse a string we no longer
have to build out this code to reverse a

02:09
string we can just call it as we need it all right folks let's take a break
let's take a break if you need to come back to this stuff come to office hours
we're going to do more practice almost exactly like this during office hours
come on on sunday we'll be doing it together
alrighty let's go ahead and take our break when we come back from our break
we're jumping into our objects for quick
review and then hopefully getting to see some apis before we wrap up today uh
what a great first day of best week ever it's been all right five minutes on the
clock folks bring it over coder thank you for the bits i appreciate you
all right here we go cn5 if you're able please get

02:11

02:13

02:14
up move around hydrate i'll see in five foreign you
i forgot to run ads damn thank you i

02:15
forgot to though [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sorry folks if you get as my apologies um
bob was popping off huh all right come on back everybody let's
get into some objects have some fun let's do some review and in
1992 thank you for the hydration cheers to you alrighty what are objects chat
what are objects everything true true but there's something specific we said
yeah they're collections of variables and functions nice
questions of variables and functions now when we're dealing with objects we

02:16
call those variables properties and we call those functions methods
when we're thinking of objects i really like to think of physical objects in
this case i always like to start thinking off by like a stopwatch a
stopwatch has some variables which we call properties and
it has some functions which we would call methods because they're tied to the
object so if i'm thinking of some properties i'm thinking that this would have a
shape property that would have a value of round
it could have a brand property that would be equal to accusplit
it could have a model property of the pro survivor 601 x 3v.1
that was a good one it could also have a minutes property of three
a seconds property a 59 it could have a color property of black
it could have an accent color property of yellow and there could be

02:17
a lot more other properties that we could think of uh lanyard set equal to
true exactly water resistance set equal to true right uh does that bluetooth
maybe that can be set to false i don't know if this one has bluetooth maybe not
maybe the the 602x not the 601x yeah i don't know
uh and then there's also some methods some functions that are tied to this
object we have the ability to start and stop we have the ability to split and
reset the ability to chain mode we have the ability to beep uh so there are a
lot of functions that are tied to this object that we would call methods
603 is to go you know it i know i couldn't that the 603 is just a new
model like i only get the 601 my uh photo already
we saw originally how to i can't afford the 603.

02:18
we saw originally creating a stopwatch using what type of notation
what type of notation is this to create an object yes nice literal notation
and we saw that we were able to add properties and methods using what
notation here what notation am i using to add a property of current time and a
method of tell time i'm using dot notation exactly i set
this equal to a value of 12 and i know telltime is a method how come how do i
know that telltime is a method because its value is a function exactly
it's set equal to a function and down here i'm calling that function i can
know that i'm calling it because i have the parentheses that we'd have with a
normal function call and i'm passing in current stopwatch.currenttime as an
argument so we know that stopwatch the current time is actually 12.

02:19
the 12 gets passed in wherever i see time it is 12 and so this method call
would wind up printing to the console the current time is 12. beautiful
me too hydra alrighty we have this objects lost galaxy code
now let's go and take a peek at it and here we have i want you to create a
dog object that has four properties and three methods no constructors
has four properties and three methods we're gonna put quick
you already have the files open because you should open the whole folder we're
gonna put a quick two minutes on the board here two minutes
you got this go fast dig deep i want a dog object that has four properties and

02:20
three methods no constructor go for it old school dot notation please
quick two exactly galaxy goofer no you can do that lost galaxy is uh
a version of the power rangers these are all power ranger names
turbo space lost galaxy are all runs of power rangers
how many more classes do we have the power rangers team for

02:21
uh until we get through objects i wasn't cultured enough hey we can't all be
beetle boris was my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beetle bar is way better
peterborough is my favorite show if you if you
you if you grew up at upn we could be friends upn man back in the day
my beetle borgs and if you're a real one like if you like a real real real one
mommy's alive most people don't know about that
mummy's alive but that was my that was my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] alrighty folks

02:22
come on back come on back let's do this together
all right so we want to go ahead and create a dog object so we can just go
ahead and say let dog equal and then we have our curly
braces and then what are some properties that you gave dog dog.breed equals
what kind of dogs y'all got doodle nice uh dog color equals golden um
it's kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up dog dot legs equals four and dog dot name

02:23
equals fido cool so has four properties breed color legs and name
and then how about methods what are some methods that the dog has
dog.bark equals we'll set it equal to a function console.log what else we got
dog dot jump equals console log of the last off beautiful and one last one

02:24
[Music] we'll just say console.log dot zoom
there we go that'll be our fetch command beautiful all right so we have
four properties dog with a breed color legs and name and
then also a bark a jump and a fetch method well done cool this was using
literal notation to create the object and then dot notation to create these
properties and these methods however if i wanted to create another dog
what's the problem we're going to run into
now that's fetch exactly it is well done ali's word if i could give you more
channel points i would in fact send me a mod mail i'm getting
you a t-shirt for that one it's really wet exactly i don't have to

02:25
repeat all this code all over again i had to repeat this all over again right
and i would have to redo the breed the color the legs the name the bark the
jump the effect i do all over again so if i want it
to have an easier way to create dogs what could i use
what could i use if i wanted an easier way to spit out dog objects yeah i could
use a constructor let's go so you want to make a lot of objects we
need a factory uh our factory think about like if you wanted to have a lot
of cars you create a car factory and that factory could spit out a bunch of
car objects over and over again we have the same thing
in javascript we have the ability to create a function that spits out objects

02:26
so here is a make car constructor it's a function it's a function that spits out
objects that's it we're using factory as an example there
are things called factories and programming that's not what i'm talking
about i was just talking about like legitimately like a car factory
all right now if we look any car that comes out of this
constructor will have a make property a model a color a doors and it will have
two methods honk and lock how do i know that the objects are going to have a
make a model a color a door is a honk and a lock how do i know the objects
themselves are going to have those properties and those methods
this exactly when i say this dot make i mean the object itself is going to have

02:27
this property of make it's going to have this property of model and have this
property of color it's going to have this property of doors and have this
method of hunk it's going to have this method of lock so down here
when i create a new honda civic what i am saying is this
special new keyword we know we see that keyword we're going to create an object
we're creating an object using the make car function we pass in honda we pass in
civic we pass in silver we pass in four we know that the object that is created
right here is going to have a make a model a color a doors and a hunk and a
lock method right so it's gonna have three sorry four properties and two methods
alrighty now we can do it again when we want to
create a new car we see the new keyword object now we're going to make another
object we're using the make car function again however passing in different

02:28
values so we're able to reuse this constructor over and over and over again
making our code way drier than it normally has been when we were doing it
a few seconds ago and we can create as many cars as we want beautiful
we also had this idea of a prototype and a prototype is just a fallback source
of properties and methods the objects that come out of our make car constructor
can always check themselves for a property and value
and if the object does not have that property or value it can go up its
prototype chain it can ask where it came from hey make
car constructor do you have this value and if it doesn't have that value can
keep going up the prototype chain until it hits the what what's what's the stop

02:29
of the prototype chain grandma it is grandma
the global object prototype everything inherits from this global object
prototype a lot of times when we've been using methods or properties that the
objects that we were using didn't have it's because they were going up the
prototype chain to get them so the example we gave last class is
let's say i didn't have a car i could go ask my mom if she had a car
and if she doesn't have a car she could go ask grandma if she had a car and if
grandma has a car i have a car it's the same thing with
properties and methods the object checks itself hey do i have bluetooth
and right now the tesla roadster would not have bluetooth when we created that
object it did not have bluetooth but what we could do

02:30
is on that constructor's prototype add bluetooth so when the tesla checks
itself it will not see bluetooth but it will go up to the constructor prototype
and since the constructor prototype now has bluetooth guess what the object that
was created from that constructor now has
bluetooth so we can just think about it as a fallback source of properties and
methods generational wealth exactly if the object itself doesn't have a
property or method it goes to where it was created if where it was created does
not have that property or method it keeps going up the chain until it gets
to this global object prototype and if it has it it has it cool beautiful
all right right here we know that tesla roadster has a doors property

02:31
but if we look at this car factory or this make car constructor
we see that there's a honk method and a lock method does this
object does the tesla roadster that came out of this constructor
does it have a two string method no does the make car constructor
have two string no so how come this works how are we able
to take the number of doors which is two and get string two back
grandma had it exactly grandma was holding on to that two string method
where'd you get the pink 50s from grandma right it went all the way up the
prototype chain until it got to the global object prototype that global

02:32
object prototype had the two-string method and so it got passed all the way
down and we can use it here even though the object didn't have it the
constructor didn't have it and we went all the way up the prototype chain to
get it beautiful all right i want us to open up tony hawk pro skater please
tony hawk pro skater save this all right tony hawk pro skater we have
some javascripts we got index.html so i want you to create a tony hawk pro
skater constructor that makes a skating game character
with four properties and three methods all right
tony hawk pro skater contractor that makes a skate again character with four
properties in three minutes if you've never played tony hawk pro skater that's
okay it's a skateboarding game so think of some things

02:33
that a skateboarder would need think of some properties think of some methods
but i want you to use a constructor this time no
no literal notation use a constructor we're going to put
four minutes on the clock here four minutes on the clock
actually we'll do five minutes i want you to really type this out i want you
to really type this out five minutes on the clock no copying and pasting if you
have to go back and forth to the slides you can but go ahead and build me a tony
hawk pro skater five minutes on the clock we'll review it then we're moving
on to apis folks we got time we game dev now exactly so far we've
built street fighter we're building tony hawk look at us go
we've been hanging out with uh lena lux too long
look at us we're we're game devs now shout out to lux too you're hanging out
there you're missing out all right folks go for it

02:34
i could play goldfinger and not get demonetized or not demonetized
content id blocked on youtube i would got this folks

02:35
three minutes 30 seconds can we see the constructor slide yeah we can bring that
up there you go i know nothing about skateboarding make it up
yeah the remake is pretty solid i've played it for a little while yeah it's
pretty dope been played on pc it's been nice just for the music alone
do a kick flip you don't need commas with constructors
when setting properties no you do not because you're not literally creating an

02:36
object it's a function that spits out an object
i like aldering i have not played it i have not had any time for video games
recently which is really sad but true i've watched some people play it
like just in passing but seems cool i never really played any of the souls
games though two minutes folks you got this
is the cs go server up maybe maybe best week ever maybe it's coming
i have a few surprises up my sleeves at least you got ads during the work time
i never thought to do that just play ads

02:37
during the break time like the work time that might be a way to get around it oh
hst dhx thank you for the posture check good one get in here
i had to copy and paste i'm sorry no need to be sorry sometimes we gotta
doggy i messed up i changed it live though hey good stuff atlantic
how do we see properties we add with the prototype and our constructor you won't

02:38
see it in the initial constructor that you make but if you open it up in the
inspector you probably see it i can try nice
lazy we're not there yet we'll get there all right folks come on back let's go
over this together alrighty so let me go ahead and uh open this up
create a tony hawk pro skater constructor that makes a skating game
character with four properties and three methods so i'm gonna create a function

02:39
uh tony hawk there we go all right tony hawk character
and why did i capitalize the t why did i capitalize the t engagement now
because the constructor does the capitalization actually do anything nah
it just lets us know that it is a constructor all right so what are some
properties that i should have what are some properties that i should have
it's just a convention exactly all right this dot character name equals
and we'll just say name and then we'll not name let's go ahead and do um
go ahead and say character name i just wanted to be a little bit different for

02:40
each one so people can see cool next but that's something else
we have stance that's a good one and we'll just call this character stance cool
this dot what else it's a uh sponsor that's a good one
sponsor eagles we'll say character sponsor oh and one more let's say
signature move i like that special move we'll say special
move and we'll say uh character move cool now this
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] should name true stance to sponsor

02:41
to move these all have to be what what do these all have to be
let's be parameters because everything's gonna be passed in to name a stance
just sponsor and to move on all right so we got our properties what
about our methods what should our methods be
like what what should our character be able to do be able to okay like flip
i see taunt and grab so we can do flip taunt and grab so flip equals a function

02:42
and we'll just say let's make it easy on ourselves console.log
uh what's a good flip trick i'm going to say kickflip for now kickflip
so our character can only kickflip that's the only flip trick it knows all right
next this dot we said taunt and we can do a function and we can
actually mention our special move and we can say like console.log
and we can just use our ticks don't make me use my
and then inside of where we put our variable we can say this dot special move
all right so you can make it say don't make me use my and then
they could say their special move and then i think the last one we said was grab
this dot grab and let's just hard code another grab trick what's that what's a

02:43
good grab trick sailfish mel and grab method yeah i'll know y'all play some
some tony hawk i'm gonna say melon melon grub all right cool
so now we can go ahead and create a character uh let's go ahead and create
the best character in the game we'll say kareem
campbell and then we're gonna need the new keyword why do i need the new keyword
darth maul why do we need the new keyword
to make a new one exactly to make a new object we want that object that's the
character's gonna help us we're gonna call our constructor function tony hall

02:44
character we're gonna pass in their name which is kareem we are going to pass in
their stance which is goofy we're going to pass in their sponsor
which is element and we're going to pass in their special move
uh which is the ghetto bird for folks that have actually played the game hey
cool all right so let's go ahead and save this
and then let's open this in the browser and if we open uh such a
so much nostalgia in that photo let's use our inspector let's go to the console
and let's ask for kareem campbell and we can see when we get kareem campbell we
get back a tony hawk character that has a name a flip a grab a special

02:45
move a sponsor a stance and a taunt so it looks like our constructor worked
first alrighty thought this was ice skating [Laughter] alrighty
we got a little bit of time left let's let's kind of go let's jump into the
future folks uh we have a new syntax that we'll get into on tuesday
on tuesday we're going to look at with the newer versions of javascript we
got some syntactical sugar right nothing underneath the hood changed we
still have prototypal inheritance but when folks came from other
class-based languages they felt a little uncomfortable
understanding what prototypal inheritance was doing and it didn't look

02:46
similar to other languages so with the newer versions of javascript
we got the class syntax nothing changes under the hood
it just makes it look a little sweeter and so you can see that it changes up a
little bit we have like this constructor on its own the methods are kind of on
their own now and so when we come on tuesday we'll start using classes a
little bit more effectively but understand as you're doing the reading
there's nothing that really changes under the hood it's just syntactical
sugar nothing really changed it just looks a little bit better cool now apis
i love me some apis i used apis for probably years before i actually ever
understood what the heck an api meant api bottom jeans so what the heck are apis

02:47
apis are something very very simple they are a simple interface
to do something complex that's it an api is a simple interface
that enables us to do something complex so what the heck do i mean by simple
interface all right right now you are all watching me on a crispy
4k camera that's getting downscaled to 1080p but i still look good
the best week ever right if i wanted to turn this camera off
what is the most primal thing i could do what's the most primal thing i could do
to turn this camera off so he like smash it
i could smash it i could throw it on the table and smash it that's not something
i want to do something else primal i could do is i
could just rip the power cable out because i'm not running on battery i'm

02:48
running on actual power kit i can rip the power cable out and the the camera
would shut off now does sony want me smashing the camera or
ripping out the power cable every single time i want to unplug it no
sony does not want me doing maybe they actually do maybe they do want me to do
this that i buy more of them right but no they don't want me to ripping out
power cables they don't want me smashing cameras they've given me an interface
that enables me to turn on and off the camera what's the interface that sony
has given me to turn on and off the camera it's a button it's a power button
and so sony has given me a very simple interface
to do something very complex think about everything that has to happen when i

02:49
press the power button right like the the the their software running on the
camera that hears that button turns off the the power system makes the
capacitor turn off all these wild things have to happen
when i press that power button and it's the same thing when i turn it
on when i press that power button all these wild stuff has to happen
for that camera to turn on do i really care at the end of the day
what's happening inside that camera when i press the power button no
i just want it to turn on and i want it to turn off
so sony has given me a simple interface for some complex action in this case the
complex action is the turning on and off and the interface is a button

02:50
another example of this is like when you go to a restaurant
the restaurant gives you a very simple interface to get food what's the
interface that the restaurant gives us to get food yeah it's a menu
it gives they give us a menu and that menu
is a very simple interface where we can point to something
and get that food now if i click if i look at that menu and i want my noodle
soup i don't really know what's happening when i make that request
i don't know what's happening in the kitchen
i have my interface which is my menu i ask for my noodle soup and something
happens and i get noodle soup back but i don't know what's happening in

02:51
that kitchen the chefs are chopping onions they are
getting bean sprouts together they're getting noodles together they're getting
um broth together they're compiling all these things to make my noodle soup and
i actually don't know and i really don't care how they chop the onions how they
put the bean sprouts into the pot i don't really care how they do all that
stuff all i want is my noodle soup so at a restaurant i have a simple interface
that enables me to make a request and i get that soup but i have no idea
what's happening in that kitchen apis are the same thing
they are a simple interface for some complex action however the interface
we're going to use first is a url just a regular urls like we
have here for the slides that we had for the check-in that we had for the merge
everything is just a url and we're going to use these urls to make a request

02:52
but instead of it being a kitchen that request is going where
where is that request going it's not going to the kitchen it's going to a
server exactly the server is going to hear that request
and it's going to send some response so just like our request that we have of
the menu goes to the kitchen and comes back with something we use urls to make
requests to a server and that server sends
something back so our simple interface is a url
the complex thing that's happening is the server hearing that request grabbing
data maybe talking to a database to get the data formatting the data and then
sending it back to us so we can use it and so that's what happens
when we are utilizing apis we are going to make a request to a server

02:53
using a url that server will hear the request grab
everything it needs to grab and then send a response
this response in the beginning is almost
always going to be something called json or javascript object notation it's
basically an object that's coming back from the server so we use a url
that url makes a request to the server instead of the server sending a soup it
sends us a big old object we can then use that object
right we can use that object to get the data and pull the data out
right so we use url to make a request the server hears that request builds us
a big old object and then sends that back just like we would get our soup
back and then once we have that object we can do whatever the heck we want with
it so the very first thing i want to do is get some cute dog photos and so here

02:54
is the syntax to make a request to a url so i'm just
going to copy this real quick we're not going to get our fingers on
the keyboard with this tonight that'll be tuesday
but i'm going to open up my dog photos javascript i'm just going to paste this
in let's go ahead and save this and let's make sure that it works let's
go ahead and open this in the browser boom open this in the browser
let's open up the inspector let's go to the console all right and we can see
something really interesting happened i made a request
and i console logged what came back don't worry i'm going to break down
what's happening here i console logged what came back can we see what came back

02:55
from the request do you see it do you see what came back from the request
this big old object came back from the request
okay so let's let's take a look at it here is our interface the url that we
are using we use this fetch method to send that request to the server
this url is actually going to the dog ceo server there is a server out there
on the internet at the dog.ceo url that is listening for these fetch requests
and when it hears these fetch requests it goes and grabs some data from its
database right it grabs some data from its
database and then it responds with that data in the form of an object
so this first thing right here is saying hey whatever we get back
from the kitchen whatever we get back from the server

02:56
make sure that it's json data parse it look at it as though it was json data
and then whatever we get back we passed through the parameter of data
right we pass through the parameter of data so whatever we got back from that
dog ceo api is going to now be console logged
right if there was an error we would see an error in our console log
but we see right now we're just console logging all the data so let's go ahead
and look at that data we got back i'm going to open this up a little bit
we can see that there were two what in the object that we got back
there were two what in the object that we got back there were two properties
message and status so the dog ceo api heard our

02:57
request and sent us back a message and a status so the cool thing is we can
actually drill in a little bit here i just want the message property and
let's see what happens when i just ask for the message property
so i'm just going to ask for the message property now and when i refresh
when i refresh you can see right now i'm just getting
the what i'm getting a what now i just asked for the message property
and it's it's a what what what data type is this it's a string
it's a string but that string is a url and if we look closely it's a url to an
image so we could actually use this we could use this this this uh lovely
image url we could use it and so let's go ahead and use it so

02:58
uh if we look in our html we see that we have a lovely image tag
let's see if we can plop the message that we got from the api into the source
all right so let's go and try that we know that the url or the image url is
in data.message so we can just do some dom manipulation here document
dot query selector we're going to target our image and what
are we going to change about the image what are we going to change what what
are we going to what are we going to change about the image we're going to
change the source and we're going to set the source equal to data dot message
beautiful so whatever we got back from the api is being passed into data we
want that message property which was the image url and we're going to use that
image url to change the source of the image that's already in our html so if

02:59
we go back and we refresh oh we're just going to get these lovely
cute dog photos i'm going to keep refreshing here for a little bit dawg oh
so every single time i refresh i am making a request to the server
and the server is sending me a new object and each time that object has a new
has a new image url in it and i can keep using that image url and each time i
refresh i get a nice cue oh that we gotta end here a nice cute dog photo
that shows up in our in our lovely age so this is just the very very beginning

03:00
of what apis can do because there are so many apis out there
we saw one that returns dog photos but there are so many apis that return so
many other really cool stuff we could get pokemon back from the
pokemon api we could get drinks from the cocktail database once you know just
this very simple pattern right this very simple pattern and you
find the different urls that we can use as our interfaces the whole world opens
up we can start getting cool data back from all these different servers we can
start manipulating it and using it in really cool ways and so to me this is
where it starts to pay off it starts to be a lot of fun you can
start to build some really cool stuff because it's no longer just your data
that you're using you can use this data from so many other people and companies
that make the stuff available to you and so on thursday we're doing some git and

03:01
github sponsored by microsoft as part of the
best week ever but we're going to end on tuesday spending our day
building and playing with apis which i'm telling you it's the next level it's so
much fun you're gonna really enjoy it and so remember
tonight was day one tomorrow we're going
and hanging out with hello's rufio don't remember i'll send you a reminder on on
discord thursday we're back for a sponsored class by microsoft so much
swag so many laptops so much cool stuff to give out friday
we have a wonderful friday with friends on discord saturday we're taking over
reddit place sunday we're back for office hours monday we're doing a
portfolio resume review session and then tuesday we're back at class you don't
have to show up to everything we're gonna have some fun so come join
us when you can hope you all had a wonderful first day of the best week
ever we're going to do a raid uh let's go over to our good friend uh juicebox
hero they're live i want to keep the good energy going if you haven't given

03:02
them a follow please give them a follow they're an amazing individual great
streamer so let's go ahead and set that up beautiful all right send up the raid
thank you so much for a great class for a great stream for the first day of the
best week ever really excited to spend the rest of the
week with you all let's go ahead and raid youtube
