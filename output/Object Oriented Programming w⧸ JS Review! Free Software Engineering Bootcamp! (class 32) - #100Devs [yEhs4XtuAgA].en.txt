inheritance and polymorphism into play do it together
and then we're going to jump on remo we're going to jump on discord and do it
together oh boy we got some review we got some things to do [Laughter]
and then we're gonna try and do it together all right
you know how we like to do i always like to start off with some questions the
question of the day getting your first client sign today

00:05
anything with peanut butter and chocolate all right
oreos all right like i said yes not really i mean we'll get there
you say peppermint you deserve spinach in your mouth what
remember fun dip oh man fun dip was a problem back in the day
you know you know know what no one's interesting about fun dip i enjoyed
i enjoyed the sticks more than i enjoyed the sugar the sugar is okay
but the sticks those white sticks yeah that was that that's what you went
to the fun dip for just all caps nasty [Laughter]
all righty folks thank you for sharing your favorites your favorite candy it's
always good to see i get to get to see what the community's into i love it i
love to see it all right if you got any real questions as folks get in here i

00:06
know folks are always running from work that's okay let's give them a second to
get in here questions you got questions hopefully i got some answers then we're
getting into a lot of fun stuff to talk about right off the rip tonight we're
gonna go through a review and then get on um either remo or discord to work with
each other it's a project night after we do some review
what is fun dip is it like dunkaroos fun dip is a literal packet of sugar
and a white candy stick and you would lick the stick
right you would lick the stick put it in the sugar
and then like eat the sugar off of this white like candy stick so it was literal
bags of sugar [Laughter] a different ghost in the house hey thank
you for the five get themselves hope you're doing well thank you for being
here good to see you should we be able to build tic-tac-toe

00:07
by ourselves at this point no i think there's gonna be a range of
folks i feel like there's some folks that could probably get close on their
own and there are some folks that might struggle on their own with tic-tac-toe
uh tonight if you have extra time it'll be some time to continue on with
tic-tac-toe and make it as oop as possible um
so i don't want to say that you should feel super comfortable where i want
everyone to be is that you should feel comfortable starting i think the biggest
problem when folks when we first start getting to these projects the projects
feel really overwhelming with a new group yes ideally with a new group the
projects feel overwhelming and we let that that overwhelming feeling
stop us from getting started and so that's something when we start doing
these project nights that's something i really want you to work through if you
know that if you know that you're someone that gets the the prompt and you
kind of freeze deer in the headlights we gotta work through that right
and the only way you honestly really work through it is to do more projects
do them with more folks and and really work on that idea

00:08
i think when we look at things like the tic-tac-toe everyone jumps to like these
really optimized solutions when tic-tac-toe is really just an event
listener you hear an event you put something into the dom if you've been
doing a lot of the problems the homework you should feel comfortable with
building a smurf or an event listener and then putting something in the dom
you could build tic-tac-toe with just event listeners and a really big
conditional and that would be tic-tac-toe right and so i think we got
to get over this um uh we got to get over this hump of like
i can't start don't know what to do because you do and then as you get more
projects underneath your belt you'll do things in a more and more sophisticated
way right and so we gotta we gotta keep getting these projects going we gotta
keep getting the homework going so we can get over that initial hump of like
deer in the headlights and keep working it out
yeah drock said it's too early in the process for perfect solutions exactly

00:09
we're here to get the job done we don't care what it looks like we're baddies we
write bad code definitely definitely agree getting
started is what i struggle with the most i agree getting started can definitely
be the hardest part do the twitch geo api for the chat i
never heard of that before i'll look it up
literally writing code will help you get
better at writing code 100 agree exactly and different all right
code wars can be really discouraging absolutely um when you first start code
wars it's not easy starting code wars is hard um but if you stick to eight cues
you stick to the fundamentals track and you stick to doing the same problems
like all array problems all string problems you start to see the patterns
you start to get better at it remember our rule is 20

00:10
minutes 20 minutes if you spend more than 20 minutes you need to stop look at
the solution and spend more time on the analysis than you did trying to solve it
you do that for a long time right if you do that for a while you do that
every day for a couple weeks cold war starts to feel start to get a little fun
you start to recognize the patterns you start to be able to do things
if you don't feel comfortable doing them by yourself yesterday mine wolf wolf
pack was working through the code wars ladder that was the push homework so
they did the eight the seven the six the seven the eight live on stream i'm
telling you folks if you're if you haven't turned notifications on for the
stream team you're uh you're you're missing out missing out folks
went from not knowing what to doing one-liners hey turn up [Laughter]

00:11
alrighty it's been helpful i agree already folks let's get into it lots of
cool stuff to talk about tonight a little bit of review then some project time
all right let's get into it checking in please if you haven't
checked in please go ahead and check in uh a like and a retweet on the tweet
please if you're here please just go ahead and do the like and the retweet
helps folks find us we got a lot of new folks in chat uh i definitely know that
that's coming from twitter and youtube so i appreciate y'all checking in
helping folks find us and uh also lets me know that you're here for attendance
so that when it comes time to end the program we get you into all the good
things we want to get you into all right thank you for checking in i
remember when you just type when you do exclamation point check-in in chat that
doesn't do anything it just gives you the link that you have to click the link
and go there and do it i wonder if the twitter api would allow us to do that
like could can is like is there like i don't even know i'm gonna assume like

00:12
hell no but it'd be cool if we could like write something that when people
type check in it actually like liked and something you know yeah i don't think
that they would let that happen but that'd be cool if we could all right
if we miss some live streams but watch the vodge we still retweet hell
yeah yes please if you are watching us through the vods or you're watching us
on youtube still go ahead and give that like and that retweet folks that are
part of the ketchup crew i still want you to have access to the things that
happen at the end of program where we're gonna get you references where we're
gonna get you the end of program support that you need but we need to know that
you've been here so even if you're watching us on youtube go ahead make
sure you go back to that tweet you like retweet it that way we know that you

00:13
watched it all right newsletter uh we have we have the sign up for the

this sunday is mother's day so uh no office hours on sunday uh don't forget
to call your mothers to argue and then on monday we are going to be
doing a get bowl where we're going to be spending uh
a probably about a normal class amount of time about three hours

fork to clone to contribute to projects to submit your homework we're going to
go through all that stuff together that way if you're not feeling too
comfortable getting github you'll have a chance to do it together live it'll of
course be recorded it'll go up on youtube but it's always fun if you join

00:15
us live cool no worries pin no worries pin all right
networking starts up again next week yes networking starts up again next week
we're going to take our time we're going
to go slow we're going to start off with one connection right just just getting
dipping our toes back into it building back up to it getting into the groove
don't worry we're going to start slow uh for folks that uh have trouble
networking we're gonna talk about a lot of alternatives next week things you
could be doing to interact with folks via text things you could be doing to
network that don't require you to show up and talk to people so
next week networking comes back right if you know that you're one of the folks
that have a little bit of the anxiety with the networking or you feel like
it's something that that's that's hard to do it's all right we're gonna come up
with some alternatives next week uh to help those folks and
one really important thing that i really want to say is that if networking is

00:16
something that causes like it's something that is not possible
right not every one of us has the privilege of being able to network right
some folks really do have situations that will preclude them from networking
only you know if that's you or not please don't ever do stuff that's going
to bring harm to yourself both physically and mentally
we will find things that you can do that give you an edge when it comes time to
the job hunt that aren't just this but i will say networking is one of the best
things you can do to get a job your code
quality the ability to code is often not the thing that gets you the job is the
folks that you know and network with that can help seal the deal so it's
really important but i really want to make sure that was said so that if you
are one of those people we'll find things that work for you too
that's all coming back next week folks all right you heard simba jingle uh simba

00:17
simba is posh now simba's posh he has uh he has an air tag
and so you heard the the air tag jingle yeah
so the the the the the normal tags are a little jiggly now all right
wait a minute leon what's that date what is this what huh what's what what
[Music] what what what's that is that does that say hold on i say 17
let's say 17 it does so today was supposed to be the deadline
for your client project i'm going to give you an extra week and some change
extra week and some change please so i know a lot of folks are like super
cool she grinded out this past week i saw you on discord i saw you on twitter
talking about it i respect the hustle and so since i saw so many folks like

00:18
coming up to the wire so many folks that we're grinding and out we'll push the
deadline a week and some change right a week and
some change just to get it so you can get those contracts signed uh so you can
you can get across the finish line uh together and so we'll push it just a
week and some change go hard in this week i saw so many of
you uh it was literally the things that made my week seeing how close so many
folks were so let's get let's give it a little a little bit more time a week and
some change just to to get it across the finish line uh
to handle the ghosting of some clients either give you a little bit more time
and then um remember there are client alternatives
if for some reason you cannot get a paid client there are alternatives you can
volunteer for a grassroots org and when you volunteer for a grassroots org
please still do the same process especially if you're gonna do stuff for
free right if you're gonna do stuff for free

00:19
then the the power is in your hand right
make sure you're still giving a proposal make sure you're still giving them a
contract make sure that they are still agreeing to be the best reference
customer that has ever existed or you ain't doing stuff for free right and so
make sure that you still go throughout the normal process that we get that
experience the experience is why we're doing this to get that experience make
sure you go through the same process and also remember that contributing to
free software open source software also counts i don't care how big or how small
or how well-known the project is you contribute to free software you're doing
good in my book exposure doesn't pay the bills exactly
exposure doesn't pay the bills these are simply alternatives for folks that
cannot get a paid client and you're still getting stuff out of
this volunteering because they're going to be the best reference customer you've

00:20
ever experienced cool oh that's an awesome project all right
uh this past week i so last week i was super busy last week i'm catching up as
fast as i can this week i'm really close
i dug myself out of the ask leon channel uh everyone that posted in the

folks at the top of the of the of the code wars clan uh if

00:25
you're not part of the code wars clan you can do exclamation point clan

00:27
they did it 100 devs did it and uh i don't know i don't know if you noticed
but uh on the code wars newsletter our very own the first the first
article they mentioned in the newsletter was blah's article on how to do code
wars so we out here folks we outside we online
uh we we all over the place so in code war's own newsletter blah top person the
people are highlighting 100 devs folks we out here folks we outside we online
let's go saying saying we taking over what can i say
best place to learn code live online we got you all right
uh it's almost a meme at this point but we gotta announce the project
winners and i have some pokemon raffles to do i'm gonna do them real quick we
got four of them or five now because i just saw brian budd uh redeemed one as

00:28
well uh the project winners there are a lot of
projects and remember this is supposed to be the funnest projects to me
um this project really blew blew me away not only was it fun not only was it
clever and creative but the code was good and not only was
the code good but the the comments they commented every line you can really tell
this group worked together uh it was really fun so the group that made
pizza sweeper why is it not loaded pizza sweeper uh
you won the project competition uh i will be sending you all messages by friday
you are all getting t-shirts uh pizza sweeper is pretty fun uh you can play
minesweeper if you ever play minesweeper before uh you can see what happens when
you lose this is papa john's that pops up of
course papa john's is the mines here which i thought was pretty fun uh you
can see the folks that that um made it down below so i'm going to plop

00:29
this into chat real quick just so you can all see the fun pizza game
i'm sure we're probably going to take it down but that's good um so this was fun
the really cool part though like if we inspect
and uh i just thought it was really cool i thought it was really fun
i love that they called them pizza weenies because they knew they went a
little too hard in the paint on this one i respect that to know that this is not
what was expected they went hard so i recognized i love that they called
themselves pizza weenies loved it um and then if you look at this code folks
look at this code let's close this x down here look at the comments
look at the comments oh my gosh it's just so pretty
and they're funny too they're funny this runs everything baby
uh i just loved it i thought it was really cool it was really clever um

00:30
it was a lot of fun as well commented it was clean code
i love that they were talking about i loved they were talking about they did
recursion and they they did recursion and then like halfway through their
recursive function like i don't think we should have done recursion anymore
[Laughter] hey welcome uh so i thought that was pretty fun uh
so definitely this is the winner there are so many other great ones though i
loved all of the sound board projects uh
we'll find some time hopefully next week to like highlight some of the other
projects a pizza sweepers you won there's also supposed to be the funnest
portfolio uh so we have one more winner that will also get a t-shirt and then
that that we're done with t-shirts for a

such a good portfolio um they had the little the little the
little the little you know the little little sauce here on the right but when
you go down i loved it they talked about themselves sebastian one change
one change please get rid of this opening line
being young without the ability to afford college get rid of it just just
talk your talk going with the heat i decided to start my professional career
by learning 3d design by myself start with that get rid of that boop get rid
of that bring the heat right i love the the quirky like the the the

00:32
the quirky layout i i love the the projects that they worked on this
project looks uh mighty familiar looks mighty familiar
but it looks clean don't it cuts and shaves the barber's point i love it
look at that and then look at this this this this this restaurant hey
look at this italian cuisine restaurant site oh
crispy and then they put something that they do on the side they do a lot of 3d
modeling i love when you add a little bit more to your portfolio that shows
your hobby or interest and so these are pretty good i i love
this portfolio because if you were here if you've been doing the work you've
already built something that looks exactly like this restaurant site you
build something that looks like this barber site and you can see how clean it
can look on your portfolio and how well they could stand out so i
love this portfolio i thought the layout
was dope the little little accoutrements are dope i love that you can switch to

00:33
different languages uh and it ah there you go
loved it all right sebastian you'll get a message from me you're getting a
t-shirt as well and so that concludes the the projects and portfolio uh we

this is a this is a dope card this is a dope card

00:38
you got the the the the two-piece card the legendary bottom
congrats on that card that's that's that's a hard card to come by these days wow
and you know what you know what i can't split them can't split them
can't i can't do it can't do it can't split i can't i can't i can't
split them up you know oh you're getting both you're getting the
top and the bottom that's like that's that's really
expensive cards you're getting both both coming your way [Laughter]

00:39
well done well done uh soup sheep this one next one is for
you soup sheet this is for you and we are at 54. soup sheet out of 54.
and then we got we got one more to do and then we're going to get back to
regular programming here 40 what do we got on 40 here
oh litwick litwick coming your way soup sheep litwick coming your way
and i got a bunch of new cards coming in soon not yet but maybe we'll add some
soon litwick all right and last one this evening this
is for brian budd brian bud this is for you uh this is out of 53 now

00:40
boom 31 what do you got what do you got coming your way
oh rushy ram oh it's one of my favorite cards too reshiram coming your way
beautiful and that concludes our pokemon drawings today
thank you everyone for for gaining so many channel points
you don't get that many channel points unless you unless you're hanging out
folks so thank you and delete that boom boy got t-shirts coming for pizza
sweeper got sebastian with the fire portfolio we
got pokemon cards going out we're just getting started folks we're just getting
started [Laughter] alrighty last uh we have some other updates just

00:41
while we're here uh we have a new channel uh we used to
have a private lbgt channel uh we have sunset at that channel is now archives
and we now have a public one so uh feel free to start joining that channel to um
hang out and we have some other stuff that'll be
happening soon on discord as well so over the next couple weeks you'll see a
couple new channels uh we're starting with that one as promised so
get in there have some fun and yeah we'll have some other updates
for discord next week too alrighty big news
we're we're we're not we're not going to do the music for this one it's big news
because it's something i've been working on for a very long time it's something
that we started the idea of last time this cohort and um
the big news is that we're ready to start the agency

00:42
we're ready to start the agency it's been a long time coming
it's been something that i've been working on for a long time with uh so
many different folks that need to kind of make to do this right
long-term goal is to have an agency component to 100 devs
to add validity to the program but to do a lot of other things um
why why why start an agency why have an agency a part of this well
i believe super super deeply that education should be free
but i also believe that education should be stipended
meaning that you should be able to make money while you are learning and i think
education should be practical an agency gets us closer to
a couple of these goals everything i do you know will be 100 free i'll never put
any of my content behind a paywall none of that nonsense

00:43
but i know folks can get clients and so that's one way you can you can
make money when you're going through this program
but we also have a lot of folks that have been reaching out that want to
build larger projects that are looking for engineers that come to me and they
say hey leon can you help me build this project and before i used to say
not in not now not yet got too much stuff going on but now the answer's
gonna be yes and the idea is to build an agency
completely in the open so everything will be in the open all the work will be
in the open the clients will be in the open um the [Music]
the the the money coming in will be open uh
the goal is to be able to work on stuff for clients but as an educational tool
right so the way it will work is that we will have clients come in
we'll break those tasks down into smaller tasks

00:44
then you can contribute to those tasks and then at the end the project will be
broken up however much money came in will be broken up to the folks that
contributed and nobody's ever really done this before
it's not something that like there's a path that we can follow so
we're gonna try it it's never been done we're gonna try
we're gonna see how it works um it may all flounder but at least we'll
do it in the open will it will be a path for other folks that might want to try
to do something the same and then it also accomplishes this goal
of being practical i want folks to be able to have real development experience
i want you to have worked with real clients for real clients building real
projects that have meat behind them that have deadlines behind them
and so the goal of the agency is to do all of that so
we're working really hard on it you're going to start seeing things pop up
starting next week our agency site's going to go live we're going to start
bringing in the first few clients that have been asking to work with us
we're going to start seeing those those agency projects get broken down into
smaller pieces we're going to start seeing tickets that you can work on

00:45
and eventually in the long run i think it'll be a really cool way for
folks to not only get practical experience but a little bit of money too
as you're going through a learning experience so
lots of little things to cover lots of little things to get through
but i want you to know like the big things that i'm working on and this is
one of them all right cool education should be free it should be
more than just free it should be paid and it should be practical i think the
agency solves all of this yeah cool uh a little bit about yeah i kind of
talked about this a little bit already um but everything will be done in the
open uh there's there's there's kind of like building and working in open but i
believe a company could also be built completely in the open so
you'll start seeing me doing streams that aren't just class but like oh if
we're working on a client project we should probably build that client
project live right let bl people be able

00:46
to see it i want i want real projects to be out there that you can see that you
can look at the code you can touch and understand and feel like i feel like
there's this gap between boot camp projects and real projects and nobody
actually ever shares real projects and so why not do those live why not
work on those projects live why not find clients
that want the clout as we're working through stuff live on twitch that we're
sharing on twitter right and then at the end people that want to work
with real clients can look and see all right here's the proposal leon sent
here's the contract that was signed here is the code that was written
how did they do this how did they set up emailing how did they all that in the
open uh and it's not going to just be me
we're going to we're going to bring in a lot of folks that want to work on this
[Laughter] anonymous hey thank you for the gift it
subs don't know who you are but thank you for being here and uh

00:47
ac kcn minus hey thank you for the five gifted subs as well
thank you for being here and so really trying to do this in the open um
have all the code open have everything so that when somebody says i want to i
want to work with real clients they have real examples there's no examples out
there it's just really not out there and so i'm hoping that this is a really
strong educational tool something that gets people excited to build
something that gets people excited to maybe get clients of their own and then
have some references when somebody says i want to see what a shopify site looks
like that's in production well boom maybe the agency built one right or when
somebody says i want to see what a static website for a restaurant looks
like boom it's all in the open and so that's that's the idea
and we'll recruit folks that hopefully want to join the stream team and work on
projects that you can see not just me working on these things but a whole slew

00:48
of other folks working on stuff we're also releasing the blog so part of the
agency site is a blog blah is going to be leading the helm
with getting our blog we write so much wonderful content um that we really want
all that in one central place so i think the agencies can be a lot of fun
i think it could be a really good educational tool really strong practical
tool i think it could be something that can put a little bit of money in folks
pockets as they're learning um but more importantly i think it gives you real
world experience uh that you can put on your resume that you can say you know
what i when when the agencies when the client site goes live and you see that
wonderful button you'd be like you know
what i built that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] button yeah
so that's the idea um the idea is to to do all this in the open to build a small
yeah a small army of folks that are crushing tickets contributing to
projects and um getting real-world experience and then leaving a
a trail of work that others that are interested in doing the same thing could

00:49
follow that's the idea that's what i'll be
working on that's what we're going to be doing together live and uh i hope that
you all are excited as you start to learn more to contribute to these
tickets and have some good things come your way cool
like the biggest news i've been holding in for a long time i'm really excited uh
speaking of stream team i i i gotta say it again we got the best
folks here that are just popping off to help support you to help
you learn uh hundreds of you came through with hello it's rufio before
class if you're if you're trying to do something a little bit before class you
should join rufio streams we also have the wolf pack in the house
look at all of this wonderful content that mine wolf has given up their time
to help you all to do review when you see when you see hard work that's being
assigned for homework there's probably a good chance the wolf pack's going to be

00:50
doing it live and so uh minewolf did the push work uh
yesterday which was that code wars ladder uh please if you if you haven't
looked at all the wonderful content that
my wolf has put out there click the link see all the past work and uh make sure
you join them live and you say well leon how can i join them live how do i know
when the wolf pack is going live how do i know when hello its rufio is going
live well once you agree to the rules and join a hundred devs on discord
remember if you have a gray name on discord you haven't unlocked all the
channels yet you want to go to the join 100 dev channel you want to click the
emojis and when you click those emojis you're going to see a bunch of other
channels open up in the 100 dev section is this lovely stream team it's at the
top if you click on it you right click on it sorry you click on it you can see
notification settings change it to all messages

00:51
whenever somebody on the stream team goes live you'll get a little a little a
little notification we only do it when we're going live only when we're doing
it with coding stuff that's going to help you learn or or be a place where
you can work together and so just just go ahead turn it on so you get the
notifications you don't miss uh when the wolf pack goes live all right beautiful
when do we get more emotes we got so many emote slots i got we gotta we gotta
i gotta hire another artist to help with them you know cool
and the newest member of our stream team first stream tomorrow 11 a.m eastern
time fox is going live i know we've rated them once before a lot of folks
have been already hanging out there amazing amazing member of the 100 devs
community and they really want to do work together streams co-working streams
where if you're working on stuff specifically 100 dev stuff you can come

00:52
not do it alone hang out have some fun and they they like to stream larger
blocks of time where it's just working together so you ever feel a little
lonely i know when i'm coding sometimes i'm like i just wish i could code with
others and that's why i hang out on twitch so much um fox is there
tomorrow 11am you'll see me send out a message uh but if you know you're just
gonna be working come hang out work together
two dimes said mine wolf is the best learn so much watching their streams i
agree they're amazing alrighty folks uh we need to get into some review we
have lots of exciting stuff oh my gosh project winners pokemon card winners
agencies come to fruition finally it's been so it's been a dream of mine for so
long coming to fruition we have the stream team taking over punch like can
we just stop for a second you know how hard it is to grow on twitch
and the fact that we have so many members of the stream team

00:53
pulling hundreds of folks that's wild it's wild to me we've taken over uh so
uh really excited i'm really happy that you're all here
i really appreciate each and every single one of you that show up for class
that show up to keep pushing yourself that haven't given up on the learning
journey that are here to be here to unlock that career as a software
engineer i'm excited you're here we're going to take our break because we're at
the top of the hour when we come back we're finna make some nerds angry we're
going to review oop we're going to build
some classes together and then we should still have like an hour left over we're
going to do a project night we're going to build a project together we're going
to review oop together this is the community folks it's a community
we're all going to get there together so let's go ahead and take our break if
you're new we like to do uh top of the hour breaks
five minutes on a timer if you're able please get up move around hydrate

00:54

00:58

00:59
and we'll be back in five minutes y'all the best [Music]
papa john's wants to smoke they stay advertising on this stream it's wild
it is wasting their money it's wasting their you know what i love
the papa john ads love them because we know we ain't
buying no papa john's it's a domino stream what are you doing
all right folks come on back box hey thank you for the hydration cheers to you
excited for your stream tomorrow first stream is part of the stream team
an ad for a coding diploma what man people just be burning dollars burning money

01:00
all right come on back folks [Music] come on back all right
i would love to get in some review and then we're going to have some time
left over for coming together to work in the best way possible is 100 devs uh so
as always this is meant to be when we're learning oop
we are learning it in real words no big words
because big words i treated disrespect and so we're gonna go through this
review we're gonna we're gonna get rid of the big words we're gonna use the
knowledge we've gathered over the past two oop classes uh to review to build
out some classes together to think through the big four pillars of oop and then
we're gonna do it together in small teams

01:01
and different you gotta get that coding diploma uh that is such a meme gift
uh such a meme gift i'm getting you one um but you're gonna
get one in your inbox in different ghosts oh boy [Laughter] what a
joke wow what a joke why are they like oh my gosh so so wild it's so wild
people out here just scheming and scamming come on so wild all right
we're not using into big fancy words we're not using any of the dusty textbooks
right we're not using any dusty textbooks we're going to use language that
actually makes sense and it's gonna make the nerds angry they spent four years

01:02
on their cs degrees and they have these big fancy words to describe stuff that
we can describe in plain english now no as we continue on in our coding journey
right and continue on in our coding journey we'll add more nuance
we'll add some more sugar on top but we're going to make it at least a little
bit of palatable right now all right big weenie
big weenie energy exactly exactly all right chat what are objects
what are objects they angry everything objects are everything
and as we start to really understand objects we start to see how they

01:03
impact oop right so what are objects objects are collections
of variables and functions but we call those
variables tied to objects properties and we call those functions
methods beautiful we can think of physical objects we
always like to think of something like a like a stopwatch it has properties like
color shape brand it also has methods like start stop reset uniform we can use
our classes as like a giant factory spitting out
objects our classes have a lovely constructor and methods that any object
that comes out of that class will have cool so we can see here we're creating a
new car and the car that comes out of this class
the object that comes out of this class we'll have a make model and color

01:04
properties but it'll also have honk and lock methods beautiful but why
what was the reason that we need to use objects why would we need these classes
and constructors to spit out more objects well what if there was a system nay
a paradigm nay a set of rules agreed upon way to structure our code
that gave us a couple really key things what if this system made it easier for
us to add new stuff what if the system made it easier to read through it was
already coded and what if you can make changes that you were not afraid we're
not going to do that we're not going to do the the sounds today i don't want to
we've done this out too much we we is that just a chill stream we did the

01:05
chill stream that's o.p baby that's o.o.p yeah that's a hope
we've had our fun we've had our fud that's oop right object oriented program
ming exactly with the first time chat polymorphism encapsulation heritage
abstraction exactly let's talk about it let's talk about it what if we wanted to
fuse our data and functionality into one thing so when we were writing our
programs up until we got into oop or object-oriented programming
our data was all over the place in variables
and our functionality was all over the place
in functions and yes we might be reading our files top to bottom but there is

01:06
nothing that brought together that data and that
functionality it can actually cause a lot of problems right
if your data and functionality is not together you're really afraid that
someone further down in the program might make changes we are all now part
of an agency we all have to work together we want to make sure that when
we make changes we're doing it in the right spot when we make changes we'll be
able to read all the code that's been written before to be really important
that we can fuse our data and functionality into one thing and that thing
is an object so we've been using objects but they're really important because
they give us a structure to fuse that data and functionality into one thing
the thing being the object and that is called encapsulation right bringing our
variables that were all in the ether are

01:07
functions that were all in the ether and
tying them up into one object the object
is the thing that makes us be able to do that and when we fuse that data and
functionality together we get encapsulation
encapsulation is the process of storing functions with their data into one thing
so we have functions that we all know we have data that's in our variables that
we all know and we put together together into one thing and that's an object
that's all we mean by encapsulation just
bringing our variables together bringing our functions together and putting it
into one thing no sound no we're just not doing the uh
the the wildness tonight we just want to get a quick review and so we can get to

01:08
project night now all right what if we wanted to hide unnecessary details
what if we wanted to separate out all the complex bits of our programs
all right our programs are going to have
lots of different individual pieces what if we could
separate them into different places and only work on the things that we cared
about at that time when we joined the agency we want to be able to just to
work on one thing well what could we do that would help us hide the unnecessary
help manage our complexity by enabling us to work on just one thing at a time
well what if we could break it into smaller
more manageable pieces of code we have this wild code base what if we could
break it down to small and more magical pieces of code do stuff once

01:09
right if we're driving a car right we're driving a car we've built
out a whole engine if we're going to build another car do we have to rebuild
a whole new engine now we already know how to build an engine and if we already
know how to build an engine and we want to fix the steering wheel do i care
about the engine no i don't care about that if i want to fix the steering wheel
i just want to focus on the steering wheel
right focus on the steering wheel of the car i don't have to care about the
engine i want to be able to add the new buttons on the steering wheel and not
lose sleep at night worrying about the engine so
what if there is a way to make our our code into more manageable pieces of
code separating the engine from the steering wheel what if we could just do
stuff once right once we build the engine we don't have to do it again once
we build the steering wheel we don't do it again well that's all abstraction
baby i love to see it i love that so many of

01:10
you knew what we were getting out to before we hit it and this encapsulation
and this abstraction they work together these pillars all support each other
beautiful with abstraction we can hide details and
just show essentials it makes our code more simple predictable manageable now
we put in all this work to building well-encapsulated well-abstracted objects
what if there was a way to create new objects based on old ones
right we could keep our code drier right any new objects we wanted to
create what if we could base them on old ones
we could eliminate a whole bunch of redundant code
if we could just make new objects based on old ones we wouldn't have to

01:11
constantly retype things rebuild things redo things and so with
inheritance we can do that inheritance enables us in plain language to create
new objects based on old ones that's all it is
it's all inheritances is the ability to create new objects based on old ones
all right the way we do that is we can make a class from another class
that shares the same set of properties and methods
right so we look at our our objects and we can create new objects that have the
same sets of properties and methods we can extend one class to another exactly
trust fund and last but not least what if there was a piece of code
that automatically worked with a bunch of different objects

01:12
right what if we could write code that automatically worked with all the
different objects that we are creating instead of messy disgusting conditionals
and switch cases instead of having to write conditional logic and then hoping
that we remember to update that conditional logic when we create new objects
what if there is a way that our code just worked with any of
the new objects we created well that's polymorphism baby
polymorphism we can write code that automatically works with all the
different objects that we are creating so i hope you're noticing that these are
some pretty plain language examples create new objects based on old ones
piece of code that works with a bunch of different objects and i hope you get

01:13
these into your brain because that's all it really is
cool so those are the big four the four pillars what if they actually made sense
right so the goal is to keep we we had two classes on it
we we keep reinforcing these kind of simpler definitions these simpler examples
right but i want to know the reason why one
more time the reason why for each one of these examples well
encapsulation right is the process of bringing our functions
and our properties to get our properties and methods into one
object the fusion of our data and functionality
but why the heck do we need to fuse our data and our functionality
well it makes it easier for us to add new stuff

01:14
if all of our data and functionality is in one spot
we know where to go to add new stuff if we have an object that's all about a
car and we want to add new features to that car we know exactly where to go we
don't need to go digging through the rest of our code we go to the one object
where we're messing with the car encapsulation brings that data and
functionality into one spot and once you have that data and functionality in one
spot it makes it easier to add new stuff then it also makes it easier to read
through what was already coded we know all the data and functionality are in
the same spot i don't have to read 100 lines down a thousand lines down i know
if i care about the car i go to that object and i can see
everything that's involved with that car since all of our data and functionality

01:15
are in the same spot we're not afraid to make changes we know
that the data we change will work well with the functionality
that's all part of one object abstraction hiding the details showing essentials
but why why what is the reason that we need abstraction well
it makes it so that our code is smaller and more manageable we can split up the
complexity of a large software project into more manageable parts
if i'm going to build a bunch of cars i can just build my engine once and
never have to worry about the engine while i'm working on the steering wheel
or i'm working on the transmission or i'm working on the wheels i know that

01:16
the engine is fine by itself and the changes i make on the wheels aren't
going to affect the engine uh it makes it so that we don't have to worry about
that every single time we want to work on a different portion of the car
and we can make changes and still sleep at night i know when i inflate the tires
from 39 to 40 that i don't have to worry about the
engine doing something weird when i'm focusing just on the tires and i inflate
the tires an extra psi go up by one i don't worry what's happening in the
engine when i inflate the tires i don't worry what's happening with the steering
wheel the steering wheel the tires the engine are all abstracted if we are
engineers working on a car we can work on each individual piece and not lose
sleep at night we can know we can go home at night knowing that that extra

01:17
one psi of pressure is not going to do something to the engine inheritance
making a class from another class to share a set of properties and methods
but why why is inheritance important why is this idea of making a
clash from another class to get properties and methods important why do
we need to do this well it can help you eliminate redundant code
if we are inheriting stuff from other classes if we've already made a bunch of
properties and methods on one class we can inherit those properties and not
have to type them all out again it saves us a lot of time it saves us a

01:18
lot of writing of code we can get more specialized objects but not lose
everything else so it helps us eliminate redundancy but
also saves us a lot of time we don't have to rewrite code over and over again
great last of the four pillars polymorphism
a piece of code that automatically works with a bunch of different objects
a piece of code that automatically works with a bunch of different objects but
why why does this matter what was the reason why does polymorphism exist well
it helps you avoid if else and switch cases it helps you write code that's
going to work naturally with all the objects that you create so that way you
don't have to worry about having to update different pieces of your code as you
start working with new objects you know that your objects are going to work with
the code that you write and you don't lose sleep you don't have to constantly

01:19
be worried that if i make a change here something's going to break over there
cool it makes your code more reusable we don't have to constantly worry about
creating new bits or bobs to support the new things that we create the code that
we create is going to work everywhere and it's going to work well
and polymorphism helps support the other pillars and all these pillars work
together and so i want to see that in action i want to see us
working on these four pillars and i want to see the four pillars come together
by building some classes so uh we have a little bit of a coding challenge to do
together uh called let's build an agency and so what i want to do here
is i want you to build a class a contractor class

01:20
and then i want you to extend that contractor class
into two other classes a front-end engineer class and a back-end engineer
class so front-end and back-end right so he's already delegating the work
exactly so i want you to build a contractor class
and then extend it into a front end and back end class
we have our lovely starter code today called objects practice
and in the javascript file you'll notice whoopsy daisy
i already have it finished whoopsie daisy it's already finished
so what i want you to do is highlight it all comment it out and pretend it's not
there but if you need to take a peek you need to take a peek
you can rest easy knowing that it's right there so i want you to go ahead i

01:21
want you to take we're going to put eight minutes on the clock
and put eight minutes on the clock i want you to try building out the
contractor class the front end and back end engineering class
then we're going to go over it together and when we're done going it over
together we're going to move into our project night
all right eight minutes on the clock you got this dig deep you get stuck it's
already there for you right but put into practice the things that we
learned about right put into practice the things we learned about as you're
building out your class think about encapsulation as you are
building out the properties in your class think about abstraction as you are
extending your classes think about inheritance and then if you have a
little bit of time give me an example of polymorphism with all the classes that
you all the objects that you could create but i don't think we'll get there

01:22
in eight minutes we'll do that together all right folks you got this eight
minutes on the clock boom you need the materials they are on
discord in the follow on materials channel
we're doing the objects practice file in class 32. you got this folks

01:23
try it out put in the practice the things that we've been covering
uh the materials in the follow-on materials channel it wasn't tied to the
actual post i posted it like right underneath of it
and we're gonna go everything over everything together

01:24
matthews yes six shortcuts go for it knock yourself out that's dope
this is class 32 what are es6 shortcuts um they're just
slightly different ways of doing stuff with the newer syntax of javascript not
something they'll worry about but somebody asked that they could use those

01:25
things we'll eventually get into more of them as we continue on in the course
apple juice do you write code do you understand the concepts behind your code
then you already are one no worries uh pie feel free to use the names that
you care about but i'll be using the word contractor yeah

01:26
mars we'll go over it in a few seconds yeah explain it then no worries clue
stark month over month shadow i think it's cool too
janice is it an extension of front or as an extension of contractor
think of it as like your parent and siblings
you wouldn't extend a sibling from a sibling zacharino try it out have some fun

01:27
goofer i do and i do got mine for 300 bucks though so
oh gee no because i don't want people to give me money

01:28
and i don't care to have a board to report to either miki no plans yet
never too late to join this one ketchup cruise here to support you

01:29
richard hey congrats on the first try bumpy i got you when we go over it
caesar you could either pass for right now and say hey i'd be open to talking
in like three months time or do a crash course on react and take the interview
it's up to you i'm a big fan of saying hey i'm not open
to new opportunities right now but give me three months and happy to talk then
yep we're covering git on monday i'm gonna learn react here yep we're

01:30
gonna cover react towards the end con value can be anything it could be
something that they're into a hobby of theirs doesn't have to be code related
they like coffee talk about coffee all right folks come on back come on
back let's take a look at this together maryam sodev hey welcome thanks for
joining us alright folks let's take a look at this
we cover how to make logins of course once we get the back end all right
i had a latte earlier pretty good hey let's go alrighty so
let's go ahead and build this out together

01:31
i want to start with a parent class and my idea is that we're building an agency
here so we need to we need to keep track of all the different people in the
agency so everyone will be a contractor at the agency and then
we will have different folks that specialize in different things so let's
go ahead and set up our first class which is the contractor so we'll have a
class of contractor and that opens and closes uh
but i made a mistake what's the mistake i made i always do this every single
time chat what's the mistake here yeah you don't need the parentheses with
a class get out of here all right so we got a lovely contractor class
and the first thing inside the contractor class will be our constructor
and our constructor we're going to have what are what are
some things that our contractors might have
what are some things that are that our contractor might have name

01:32
title skills i like that i like that yeah
cool i like name and see name roll rate i like that let's do name and roll
so we'll do this dot name equals name and we'll do [Music]
and we'll go ahead and do [Music] this dot roll equals role
and we're going to need the parameters for this so we'll need name and we'll
need role cool so now when we create an object using this constructor
it'll have a name and a role and um this could work but i think we learned
about something that could maybe help us out here as well
yeah we learned about those underscores so let's go ahead and let's just create

01:33
a contractor real quick um let's create a contractor let's call them
moshi for now let moshi equal and we'll say new contractor
and we're going to pass in the name of the machine and their role is front end
all right so they're they're front end developer
cool let's save this real quick and let's let's see what we get when we open
this in the browser open in the browser let's forget that it's the uh rig it on
logo and let's ask for moshi in the console when we ask for moshi we get a
contractor name of the machine and we get a roll of front end right
so we can see that moshi is a contractor that has the name the machine
and has the roller front end however let's say

01:34
we we got a new hr person at the agency right we got a new hr person at the
agency and they realized that moshi goes by moshi and not the machine
right so the hr person thinking that they're doing something good
goes in and does moshi dot name and sets it equal to moshi
great now if we ask for moshi back we can see that the name has been updated
why might this be a bad idea why would we need to fire hr
why why wha what is what is this here what is this or not hr but we might need
to fire some engineers right what happened what's bad about this

01:35
because toby sucks it's not abstracted if anyone on our team can just come in
and start changing properties and stuff willy-nilly
how could we ever sleep at night knowing that at any point in the future someone
could change something so fundamental as a name right anyone can mess with it
exactly so we really want to be able to abstract out the name and abstract out
the role so that someone doesn't accidentally mess with it later on
right someone doesn't accidentally mess with it later on so let's go back to our
code is there a way that we could make it so that when we create a contractor
hr can't go in and mess up the names brook leak just said underscore
yeah we can use underscores so we can do underscore name
underscore role and now when we pass in the machine

01:36
the machine is going into name so wherever we see name is the machine
but it's no longer tied to the name it's tied to underscore name that'll be the
property on our object will be underscore name and then front end we'll
go into roll and we'll wind up having underscore roll with the prop with the
the underscore rule with the value of front end right with front end so
let's go ahead and save this right and let's go ahead and see
what the heck is going on let's go ahead and see what's going on all right
let's try this again now let's save this let's go back

01:37
and let's go ahead and call mashi again beautiful we have moshi right
and now let's see if hr can go in and mess with the name cool so we did that
we we go and we asked for moshi dot name wait a minute
they could think he's still changing what the heck's going on
i thought i thought we said if we use the underscores it would do something what
huh oh you you all said in chat underscore yeah i'm not using a getter
i'm not using a getter so we got to do a getter let's go ahead and do get
and we'll say name and we're going to return this dot underscore name beautiful

01:38
this underscore name beautiful so now when we do it and we ask for the name
this lovely getter is what's going to go ahead and
get the name and it's going to go ahead and get our underscore name so let's go
ahead and save this let's go back to our site now and see if hr can can be a
baddie all right so we asked for moshi you can see that moshi has the name of
the machine if i do mashi.name equals moshi not the machine
and i asked for moshi back we can still see that the name of mashi is still
the machine tina works in hr and we can still see that the name is
the machine so hr can go wild trying to change the name
and uh nothing's gonna happen to the actual object it's been abstracted away
we we're not we don't we're not gonna mess with it which makes our lives as

01:39
engineers a little bit easier because we
know that we can be working on stuff and not messing up the objects that we've
already created cool beautiful now let's go ahead and let's let's do
something that's that's a little forbidden let's do something a little forbidden
all right what if we did what if we did moshi dot underscore name
right what if we did underscore name equals doggo
all right what if we did that now we ask for moshi we can see that the name has
been changed wait a minute hold up leon he said we use the underscore and we use
the getter what's going on here so we can see that if you do change the

01:40
underscore name where it catch me outside do you know catch me outside
she made 50 million dollars 50 million dollars off of of 50 million
i'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that's all i got to say and it's your fault
y'all have not gotten to the million channel points for me to unlock my off
and uh i'm actually kind of just mad at y'all
uh because i'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up now and it's your fault
somebody get to the million channel points unlock the only fans i got i
can't wait can't wait i'm hiring a really good
tasteful photographer we're gonna have lots it's gonna be a full shoot
can't wait somebody get me there right so wait a minute we said wait wait
wait let's go back and look at this code wait a minute you said leon

01:41
this underscore makes it private right so that like we don't mess with it
well wait a minute does the underscore actually do anything chat
does it do anything special nah it's not doing anything special but
it's a convention it's something that we're going to agree to that whenever we
see an underscore don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] touch it don't touch it
so when you join the agency you will get a coding guide
a a set of documentation that describes our style and how we write code and one
of the lines in that style guide will be if you ever see an underscore for a
property you don't touch it that's private you shouldn't mess with it uh if

01:42
you do mess with it you're gonna be talking to hr right so we agree don't touch
and then we only access it through our getter so this makes our code
nice nicely encapsulated we got our we got our properties here but what about
some functionality what's some functionality that we can add here
what do we want our contractor to be able to do
do work say hello yeah let's do say hello
so we want all of our contractors to be friendly and be able to say hello and so
we want our country to be able to say hello so we can say um
uh let's just put a console log here console.lob console.log we'll say we'll
do ticks we can use a template string we say hello my
name is and we can use our template string here we can say this dot

01:43
underscore name and i'm on the and we can go ahead and do uh this
underscore role and we'll do team there we go hello my name is blank and i
am on the blank team um looking good uh we forgot something so far what what
have we forgotten so far sorry yes we shouldn't be saying oh f
anymore we should be saying blip now we're we're we're making a blip account
not not an off account we're we're we're supporting vape juice and true
yeah we need a getter for for for our roll
exactly so let's go and do a getter for our roll get roll return this

01:44
dot underscore roll beautiful and so we're looking good here we have a
getter for our name a getter for our roll we have a say hello our data in
this case name and role is nicely encapsulated with our functionality
which is say hello all right which is say hello
and if we go ahead and save this and run it we should be able to see it working
so let's go ahead and ask for moshi back
we can see it's a contractor they have a name in the machine they have a role of
front end if we do moshi dot say hello you get hello my name is the machine and
i'm on the front end team so it's working good excuse me excuse me excuse me

01:45
looking good all right i'm the machine pleased to meet you
okay so we we we now have the ability to add contractors
uh to our agency which is feeling which is feeling pretty good uh now
we are gonna have different teams within the agency we're gonna have a front-end
team we're gonna have a back-end team and so um
let's go ahead and build out two more classes that enable us to extend
uh this lovely this lovely contractor class right
and so i'm gonna go ahead and create what type of teams do you think we
should have i already said we have front end and
back end team so let's go ahead and build a class for our front-end team
cool extendo i got the extendo let's go all right so let's go and do class
we'll call it front for front end developers we'll call it back for back

01:46
end developers front to front my baby back to back uh baby all right so front
extends contractor cool and if i want inside of my constructor
right inside of my constructor i know i'm going to have the name and role still
but if i want to be able to use the name and roll from contractor what do i need
super yeah we can do super and we can pass in name and roll and so
what super is going to enable us to do is when front sees super
super is going to be able to grab the values that are here

01:47
in the constructor on the parent class this is a little bit of inheritance that
stops us from having from having to do what what does this little bit of
inheritance stop us from needing to do yeah it stops us from having to repeat
code i don't have to repeat giving a name and a role to any of my front-end
developers right it makes it so that we're not repeating code a little bit of
inheritance can go a long way beautiful so we inherited the name and role
from our from our constructor class um but let's let's make it so that the
front end developers have something different um front-end developers
probably use some different technology than a back-end developer would use um
so maybe we can have a new a new thing called technology technology
right so i'm going to call it i'm going to pass in a parameter of tech and then
i'm going to do this dot underscore tech

01:48
equals tech so when i create a front-end developer i can pass in the technology
that they're comfortable with maybe like
react right html css javascripts exactly cool and then i want my front end
uh to have some some functionality but before we get to the functionality what
do we got to set up for this this uh class
before we add some functionality what do we got to set up
yeah i gotta set up our getter get tech and we're going to say return
this the underscore this dot underscore tech
um and so when they ask for tech they'll get this underscore tech back
and uh let's add some functionality i want them to have their own version of
say hello so they're gonna have same they're gonna

01:49
have their own version of say hello and i want that say hello
to be kind of similar but i'm going to make it say something a
little bit different um hello it's me um yeah you say hello i am uh
this dot underscore name and i work on the front end beautiful hello it's me
california dreaming about we used to be [Music]

01:50
sorry i got to stop before we get uh copyrighted cool hello my name is
killed my father prepare to die cool all right looks good i like that
somebody said what's happening on line 22
line 22 is giving us access whenever you see super that means go up a level
right means go up a level so super enables us to get access
to the properties here that were set on our parent class all right all right
and so super just enables us to go up and yoink grab this stuff so we don't
have to repeat our code down here it's that little bit

01:51
of inheritance coming into play cool for the underscore thing can you use uh
octothorpe to make it private well remember is the underscore actually
doing anything is the underscore doing anything
is it special to javascript in any way nah it's a convention
and so different teams are going to have different conventions if you're joining
our agency the convention is the underscore and that means don't touch
right but could you use a different one sure all right
so we got our own kind of say hello it's looking good it's looking crispy let's
create a new let's create a let's create a uh
instead of doing a new contractor let's do a new front end developer so we'll do
front and we'll pass in the machine we will pass in the role which is front
end and we'll pass in the technology that they use which is react cool

01:52
let's go ahead and come back here let's refresh let's ask for moshi
and now you can see moshi is actually an object coming out of the front class
you see they have a name of the machine a roller front end and they have a tech
of react and something cool is if we do moshi dot say hello
you can see we get that slightly different we get that slightly different
console log hello i am the machine and i work on the front end beautiful
am i using moshi to test your code to make sure it's working correctly exactly
i'm just making sure that everything we're doing building out here is working
all right so we are using super in the child
classes to get the contract stuff that was built in the contractor class exactly

01:53
all right let's keep pushing so now we have a front end developer
that extends contractor let's do the same thing for a back end
um so let's go ahead and i'm gonna copy and paste ugh
don't ever copy and paste but we're we need to save some times here all right so
now we're gonna make this back which extends contractor
we still have the kind of new things that we added i'm just going to change
this say hello to back end cool back end back end now
we could say all right leon well shouldn't we have like
if we're building out the full agency we might have some contractors and some
contractors might be designers some contractors might be

01:54
developers so leon shouldn't we have a developer class that inherits from
contractor that then we could make additional children classes or
subclasses that are front and back end and if if you were asking that question
i would say heck yeah that sounds great seems like you're thinking in an
object-oriented way but we don't have time so [Laughter]
that's something that you might do tonight during the project night oh oh
who would have thought maybe doing something oh project um
who would have thought but i'm glad you're thinking that way
because that means you're thinking in an object-oriented way beautiful
make a junior class and ban anyone who uses it exactly all right
so now we got a back end of we got a back end class we got a front end class

01:55
we got a contractor class uh let's create another uh contractor here let simba
equal new new back and their name is simba and um they are on the back end team
and they use [Music] node all right now we got two contractors let's see
let's look at moshi beautiful a lovely front end developer we have simba whoop

01:56
not that come on now we have simba what oh why is it doing this to me
i don't care about svg animated boolean what is this no
all right there we go simba is not defined why would simba not be defined
or is someone not be defined if we look simba's right there
why is simba not defined because i didn't refresh let's go ahead
and refresh let's try it again boom gotcha 13th try you got got
don't forget folks just because we're fancy now just because we're fancy now
just because you're like leon you created a constructor cl a

01:57
contractor class that's really just syntactical sugar on top of constructors
i see that you created your constructor with some lovely private properties here
when we see the underscore it means don't touch
and to access those properties we set up some getters that return those private
properties i saw that you have a lovely method here called say hello that is
using those private properties and then i saw that you
extended your parent class into a front and back class that still has access
still has access to the name and role of the properties that were defined in the
parent class i see you did that using the super keyword i saw that you still
had some other private properties that you set up getters for i saw that your
say hello method was a little bit different on the front end and the back end

01:58
classes i saw that you did all that right i saw that you did all that
but you forgot to refresh [Laughter] just because we fancy now just because
we can read all this code just because we can do all these cool things just
because we're object oriented we're using oop you know me in our day-to-day
lives does it mean that refreshing is beneath us it happens cool
should we merge tech into the parent that's a good idea to bring to project
night good i idea to big project night all right
we need to take a little bit of a break because we're at the top of the hour
when we come back from break we're going

01:59
to quickly read through this again we're going to see a little bit of
polymorphism just a sprinkle of polymorphism and then we're going to
move into project now you don't want to miss project night so let's go ahead
we're at the top of that let's take our brick when we come back we're adding
polymorphism into the mix here we're walking through it one more time we're
going to see super again we're going to see private again we're going to talk
through those things again right and then
we will add polymorphism and then we'll move into project night here we go hey
well you can change that you don't know how to code you can change it to x-men
point 100 devs happy you're here you found the right spot
all right folks five minutes on the clock here
we're new around here we'd like to take breaks at the top of the hour to be
healthy save our fingers our eyes were in this for the long haul
marathon not a sprint this is a career for the rest of our lives i'll see you

02:05
all in five yeah no worries jim come on back folks look at this together
alrighty boom california dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger
alrighty come on back let's just review this quickly and then we will move into
project night alrighty so we saw some things here let's let's talk through it

02:06
what about this is encapsulation about this is encapsulation
yeah we got our methods and our properties in one spot
all right we got our we got our lovely methods
and so our lovely properties and our lovely methods in one spot we have fused
our data and our functionality into one location if we wanted to add more stuff
about our contractor do we know where to go
if we want to add more stuff about our contractor do we know where to go yeah
if we wanted to add more stuff about our front end developers or our backend
developers do we know where to go yeah and if i wanted to work on my front

02:07
end developer am i worried about messing with anything in my back end developer
like if i just want to add a bunch of stuff to my front end developers right
like we got we have a lot of a lot of clients coming in that just need
front-end work can i just can i just focus in on this front-end developer do
i do i if i make any changes in here do i do i worry about what's happening in
the backend developer no even things like even things that are
shared right we have this super that gets shared up to the contractor right
but um am i worried about that what is that an example of if i can make changes
here right make changes here but not worry about it
yeah it's a form of abstraction right we're extract like encapsulation and
abstraction are pretty closely related right
so it's a form of abstraction we also have another form of abstraction coming
in happening here where we are making it

02:08
so that individuals can access stuff but they can't mess with stuff
we're giving them access but making sure
they can't mess with it we're extracting out the complexity the details right so
there's an example there of abstraction as well nerds are shaking in their boots
all right encapsulation can enable abstraction yeah exactly and so we have some
examples of encapsulation we have some examples of abstraction
what's an example of inheritance that's happening here
yeah we see the super the super enables us to inherit the name and the roles
properties from the contractor and as stuff gets way more complex we're going
to be inheriting more and more and that super enables us to go from the child
class or the subclass into the parent class and get access to all that stuff

02:09
without having to rewrite it down here so you can imagine as as our our
contractor gets bigger and bigger and that constructor gets meatier and medium
and there's more and more stuff there there's more and more methods up there
well we get access to all of it because we're inheriting it
right we're inheriting it we could also do something like this let's say um
say bye all right let's do say bye console.log has been a pleasure working
with you all right say bye all right let's save
this let's go back let's go ahead and go to uh let's refresh
let's take a look at simba let's do simba dot say bye how the heck does simba
know how to say bye simba is a back end engineer [Laughter]

02:10
civ is a vacuum engineer how do they know how to say goodbye how do they know
how to talk the clients how do they know how to talk the client do we look
our back end engineer doesn't have a say goodbye
right how do they know how to say goodbye back to the dungeon exactly oh
because back extends contractor so that's another example of inheritance
right we went up the prototype chain to get say bye because remember this class
stuff has a syntactical sugar on the prototype chain
uh simba did not have say goodbye so it went up to the class constructor sorry
to the the class contractor and it got say bye so another form of inheritance
there right beautiful cool all right um so we got good examples of

02:11
encapsulation some good examples of hey zeke the caddo hey thank you for the
five get the subs i appreciate that thank you for being here
so we got lovely examples of encapsulation abstraction inheritance
but we still need to see a little bit example of polymorphism here how about we
we have these lovely these lovely contractors let's uh
let's go ahead and add them to an array like i want i want to have like a a list
of all the contractors in the agency right we're gonna have all these
different contractors at the agency so let's say agency uh list equal
and we have moshi and we have simba right so now we have we have an array
a list of all the folks that are at our agency we have moshi simba and
eventually we have a lot more folks i want to make sure that every person

02:12
that works at this agency knows how to say hello it's very important
it's very important that uh that we make sure that all of
our our our members of the agency know how to work well
with uh clients so i could just like a simple for loop here
and i could say all right we could say we can just say like like
each person in the agency or each contractor in the agency let's just say
person because it's a different word uh and we can say each person of the agency
list right each person of the agency list i want each of those persons to say
hello so what this is going to do is it's going to loop through our agency
list we can see our agency list has two contractors in it moshi and simba so
this for loop should run two times the first time person will be

02:13
moshi and then the second time last time this loop runs person will be simba and
so if we save this and we go back we go back
we can see that hey i'm the machine and i work on the front end and hello i am
simba and i work on the back end so the say hello the say hello worked on both
mashi and simba mashi and simba why the heck these are completely
different objects one is a front end and one is a back end
yet say hello works on both of them what is that why does that work
yeah polymorphism exactly it works by polymorphism and polymorphism makes it
so that we can write some code and know that it works for all of our

02:14
objects we don't have to worry about having like a messy conditional or a
switch case where we check to see if they're a front-end developer and then
we say one thing we check to see if they're back in developer and says
another thing we just know that it's gonna run on
every single object that we've created and so polymorphism supports the other
pillars so that we don't have to have this nasty code to keep up to date it
just works um what is person person is just a
parameter sorry not a parameter it's just a variable here so instead of
saying like let i equal we have this like fancier new syntax of doing for
loops so whatever i put here i could put like
robot unicorn and then robot unicorn will hold moshi and simba and so then i
have to change this to robot unicorn right so it's kind of like
how we'd have i in our other for loops like we would declare i uh well robot
unicorn is the variable that we're using and then robot unicorn will hold each

02:15
value that's inside of that array and so same thing will work we can save it we
can go back and refresh and we still get the same thing
difference between four and four of objects and arrays
yeah it's an iterator yeah i can think of as an iterator yeah cool alrighty
wonderful wonderful folks alrighty so we covered a lot over the past
two three classes a lot of really new meaty topics
right a lot of stuff that we could still probably play around with a little bit
for a while um can we extend can we send children into new children
can we can we make polymorphism do more what happens if we drop the underscores
there's a lot of stuff that you need to explore
right a lot of stuff you need to explore

02:16
and that you can have fun with and build but exploring and building by yourself
is boring right who wants to build and explore by themselves so we have a lovely
group work or project night and so we're not going to do a raid we're going
to jump right onto remo or we're gonna jump on to discord so if remo doesn't
work for you you can jump on the discord you'll notice on remo there are certain
tables on each floor for chat only work so we have some folks
that don't really want to do video and voice you'll notice that there
are two tables on each floor for chat only so for folks that might have a
little bit of anxiety of being on voice and being on video you now have some
chat only tables or folks that just don't have mic or or
or camera there will be some chat only tables so feel free to
join one of those tables if that fits you otherwise you'll see that there are

02:17
two lovely remo links if remo does not work for you you can always jump on
discord and so what i want you to do is i want you to get into groups tonight we
got like 40 minutes left we got like 40 minutes left and so for these 40 minutes
i want you to get into a group and i want you to talk through some of
the basics of oop i want you to come up with a parent class
extend that parent class into at least two children i don't care what it is it
could be contractors it could be espresso machines it could be cars
and then once you've done that once you've built out together the parent
class the children class you should talk through encapsulation extraction
inheritance polymorphism all the things that we cover together talk through
these things explain them if you're in a group with somebody that doesn't get it
make sure they get it if you feel like you're light years ahead and you really
understand oop take a chance and some time to explain it to others your

02:18
knowledge will solidify and you'll help somebody figure out a little bit more so
work together work collaboratively as always be kind
if you if you say anything on remo or discord it's not the kindest thing you
could say you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you don't belong here uh
and if somebody ever steps their boundaries just let us know send us a
mod mail we're happy to deal with it so let's go ahead get together on remo or
discord talk through oop build a parent class extend it to two children talk
about how you're using encapsulation abstraction inheritance polymorphism
and if you have a little bit of time feel free to maybe also discuss
tic-tac-toe but i think this will take up most of your time so we're going to
do that your homework your homework due next
week is to play review break the code we've gone over the past few classes
make sure you're done your professional checklist we have to get to async await
