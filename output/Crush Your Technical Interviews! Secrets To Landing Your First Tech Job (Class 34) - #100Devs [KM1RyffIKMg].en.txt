00:02
putting in motion so that over the next few weeks we get
ready for that hunt we need to we need to start sharpening our spears we gotta
start building our shields we gotta we gotta get ready for the hunt and so
on tuesday we talked about all the little things we
have to start doing to open all those doors that are gonna help us to get the
technical interviews and then once we have the interviews
tonight's class is going to prepare you for them a lot of folks we know this
a lot of folks go into this process like an accident
so syrah hey how you been hey thank you for the five you get the subs
hope you're doing well thank you for being here
hey this is awesome thank you for being here hope you're doing well
like i said folks people a lot of people go into this
process like an accident they they learn

00:03
how to code and then they start clicking apply you know you know one of those
people that just they're just they're just doing this all day long
they're just clicking clicking clicking and then then a week later a week later
they're upset leon i applied the 400 jobs i didn't hear anything back
you did the process wrong so on tuesday we talked about how to do
the process right and all the little things
that you can do to open the doors right now like i said i'm going to show you
how to play the games up to you to play them
i showed you a lot of different doors to
open it's up to you to figure out if you want to open each and every single one
of them but if you open them the opportunities will start coming your
way and when the opportunity prevents itself we're going to be prepared
and tonight's class is about being prepared when you

00:04
see those referrals come through you get
the interviews how do we pass that first sniff test how do we get to the
engineers and how do we satisfy their two most important questions can this
person code and do i want to work with them for the next two years i'm going to
show you how to slam dunk both of those questions so you get the offer
zim joining from zimbabwe hey that's what's up thank you for joining
us hope you're doing well all right i'm excited we're going to talk about that
professional checklist the things that are on it just to make sure we're all on
the same page we're going to talk briefly about the hit list again because
i i honestly believe the hit list is the most important thing you could ever
do to get a job hands down most important thing then
we're going to talk about the interview process like what does it actually look

00:05
like what does it actually look like to go through the process like from from
referral to offer what does that whole process look like what are some of the
things you should expect and then we're going to learn the two
secrets to knocking these interviews out the park it's car and prep folks if you
master car and prep you will do well in your interviews and it's something you
can start practicing today and in fact your homework is to start practicing it
cool alrighty folks i always like to start off i always like to start off with
answering some questions i always like to start off with
answering some questions and so my question of the day
before i answer y'all's questions my question of the day was how many folks

00:06
did you endorse on linkedin how many folks because i added all of y'all to the
linkedin group too many 100 plus 79 5 ten
fifteen twenty five eight twenty so many come on now
i i don't i don't think that's enough i just
i i don't i need you to do another round
folks i need to i need to do more i need to find five random folks to endorse
please because i added you all to the linkedin i had a thousand plus of you all
yesterday added a thousand plus of y'all yesterday
so y'all in there and i did it about like an hour ago i added more folks now
remember i said if you didn't have a picture you
didn't have your profile filled out i wasn't going to add you so if you got
denied fix those things and try again and i'll add you on the second time you

00:07
we inside exactly all right the link is in the slides again you can
also do exclamation point linkedin if you haven't joined our linkedin group
yet it's a great place we're going to be using it throughout the rest of the
program you need to be in that linkedin group so we can do the things that we do
like endorsing each other uh and all the other kind of special things we have up
to just get that ball rolling folks remember there's an algorithm to be
played here right so we're doing these little things that are going to increase
our algorithmic chances of recruiters reaching out to us and this is one of
the first ones cool you got questions because i got answers
as a ux ui design junior can i join the community yes but you can no longer
refer to yourself as junior if you want to join this community we don't use
those words around here you're either a ux developer or you're

00:08
not we don't like that word around these parts why are there so many recruiting
recruiters prowling lately i'm telling you if you do all these little things we
talked about on tuesday you start to get you start to get that inbound interest
and there's a game to be played folks and most people don't know how to play
the game they don't know what they're doing they
go into this process like an accident but the more you do the things we talked
about on tuesday the more interest you get and then we're gonna show you how to
capitalize on that interest tonight this is probably the worst part of being
a developer the recruiter spam so i agree but here's what you do you have a

00:09
canned response right i have a canned recruit response hey i'm not currently
looking for new opportunities but here are the things that would make me be
interested i list the salary that would make me move i list the tools and
technology i want to work on and the space that i'm interested in
if you ain't paying me big bucks and it's not focused on education that's it
this is where this conversation stops right but if you do hit all these boxes
send me an email please so having those canned responses for the
recruiter spam can be really helpful someone from google recommended not to
put a head shot because companies don't want to be biased yeah don't put a so
remember some advice is us specific is this
different in some countries in the u.s don't put a photo on your resume

00:10
some recruiters are instructed to immediately throw those resumes in the
trash can because they don't want to get into some sort of legal kerfuffle
because of the way you look right and so the advice in the u.s is not to put on
your resume now some countries that's like a huge you must have like
there are some countries where if you don't have your photo on the resume it
ain't going to work so it's going to be on you to know kind of what is the
acceptable standard in your area how should we use the resume now even
though we haven't built the hundred hours project the other two big projects
that are provided well you still have some other projects that you've built
throughout program you might have already got your client your freelancing
or your volunteering or your contributing to free software all those
go on the resume to start pumping it up and any of the projects that you did
work on talk about them in a beautiful way every
single person that did the html and css class they have built a

00:11
project for a hair salon or barber they built a project for a restaurant for now
those can be on your resume as the filler until we get to the more media
projects yeah a lot of asian companies uh require
the photo that's what i've heard yeah how can you be sure it's a legit
recruiter and not a scammer um i don't send anything until i've done my like i
send my can respond if it goes further you got to do your research you got to
dig into the company you got to make sure that the emails match up we'll talk
about that in the future i had a potential client and she asked
what was my ballpark because she has no idea i tried asking your ballpark she
has no idea how can i approach the money talk you throw out a big number and if
they react to it then you're fine so we're talking 100k then and they'll go
heck no not 100k then they go oh so like what's reasonable to you that's it

00:12
everybody has a ballpark number [Music] should we add recruiters to the hit list
uh yes but remember the hierarchy is like the the hiring person or the hiring
manager engineers and then recruiters you're trying to look for all three when
you're adding a company to your hit list so if we're going for 60 networked
applications you're going to have probably at least 180 people on that hit list
photo on your portfolio is fine yeah photos on portfolios are pretty common cool
do you have a hit list doc yeah we have it's the you can do exclamation point
sheet uh how would i know if my idea for my

00:13
100 hours project is too involved well you take your 100 hours project and you
boil it down to the simplest thing you can do
for that project so any project can be boiled down into doing one thing
do that one thing and then add features as you have time within that hundred
hours so really you could have any idea in the world and you can boil that idea
down to the simplest easiest thing to do for that one idea
see if there's a way to accomplish that and then that's what you do and then as
you have more 100 hours you add on to it can the 100 project be a game i highly
recommend that you don't use games for your hundred dollars project they need
to be full stack web applications games have too much of a smell to them
uh so yeah full stack web applications or what 100 hours project should be user
logins they're doing something you know now those doesn't mean you can't build a
game like that that's on you have fun with it but for the 100 project it's a

00:14
full stack web application because that's what people are going to hire you
to do cool alrighty folks we got some questions in let's jump on into it
how do we make a user login we're not there yet we haven't gotten to the back
end yet cool all right folks thank you for the
questions i think we got the whole crew let's keep pushing
all right if you haven't checked in yet please go ahead and check in
there was a tweet today go ahead and like and retweet please if you do
exclamation point check-in that'll give you the link to the tweet
you can go there like and retweet please remember that's how we take attendance
if you want to do all the goodies that we do at the end of program we need to
make sure that you are here for class to go ahead and like and retweet please
also let folks find us we've been having so many new folks in chat
uh i i've seen at least 20 new folks today in chat which is wild
so it's working folks are finding us and

00:15
not spending 20 grand on a boot camp and i love it
alrighty thank you for checking in youtube i'm up to date on youtube folks
let's go turn up 10 seconds nine is your warning
seven six five four three two one [Music]
just a little one just a little one i'm caught up on youtube uh i i know a lot
of folks that follow us here at 100 devs uh can't join us live
i totally understand that that's why we have the ketchup crew
and the ketchup crew it sucks when you have to watch them on the the vods on
twitch because the vods on twitch have ads but the youtube channel is not
monetized so you can watch all of our glorious class videos uh ad free baby
and so we're caught up to speed last tuesday's class

00:16
is on youtube uh so if you're watching us on youtube what's up hope you're
doing well uh please like comment and subscribe it does help more folks find
us i appreciate y'all all right no class friday
uh i'm gonna push our car class to next friday i need a little bit more time to
prep for sunday because sunday is our super review
so no car class tomorrow we're going to push that to next friday and sunday is
going to be our review we're going to go hard in the paint on
sunday so i need a little bit more time to prep like examples and stuff like
that and so uh if you want to review the from the beginning to now in terms of
javascript and preparation for the back end well that's what sunday super review
is for no idea how long it's going to go we go until folks until we hit the end
i try really hard to plan out each class to hit that three hour mark but these
super reviews there's no way for me to estimate how long we go so sometimes it

00:17
goes three five seven we did a nine hour one last time
we go until we go so if you want to review all the javascripts before we hit
back in that's what sunday is for alrighty folks
remember you have a fresh start if you're catching up you were behind you
missed a few homeworks you've missed a few check-ins now is your fresh squeaky
clean start meaning that you can start checking in starting now
you can start submitting your homework starting now and we're all good in my
book fresh start cool next week we're hitting up the back end
so if you're excited to get into back in web development you're excited to learn
node that's what we hit all of next week
so join us on the super review on sunday that way you're ready and prepared for
back end next week all right remember networking started this week remember
we're open all these doors folks opening
all these doors the opportunity can come our way our networking picks back up

00:18
one coffee chat this week please we're going to pick back up the steam
we're going we're going to get back to our normal networking level but this
week one coffee chat please remember client deadline tuesday may
17th if you haven't gotten a paid client that's your deadline if you haven't
volunteered at your deadline to get that
volunteer contract or contribute to free software you got a fresh start folks
got a fresh start bring it across the finish line
do you need to be proficient in js before moving to the back end
proficient's a weird word i think you need to know some javascript we want to
we want to be comfortable with it but if you've been here with clash you're
comfortable enough as we continue on node we'll keep working on our
javascript skills if you're doing your code wars every day you're doing your
yankee every day that's more than enough to jump into the back end people always
think the back end is super super difficult it's not and i know it's
really weird to say it's not really learning things that are

00:19
difficult it's about connecting the the back end is really just like a
really messy maze and once you know how to connect all the dots to the maze that
that's all it is and so we have a lot of folks that get really anxious about the
back end and then two weeks in they're like wait a minute i can build full
stack web applications it's only been a few weeks yes that will be you um of
course you can always go super super super super super deep into it but the
basics that we'll cover in the beginning you can pick up pretty quickly
yeah i think there there are some folks that really do think the back end is
easier yeah i agree with you threx cool we need inspiration for 100 hours
project that's on you you got to pick something that you're
passionate about something that you want to bring into this world i can't give
you ideas for your 100 hours project because you won't want to do them my
hundred hours ideas are all around pokemon and chess i don't know if that's
what you're into so i don't know if that
would help you right and cook yeah there you go and cookies mine are all cookies

00:20
pokemon and chess related ideas can't can't help you unless unless that's your
interest right and so you want to pick something you're excited about something
you're passionate about and if not divker had one of my favorite
bits of advice uh divaker said if you can't find something you're passionate
about find something you hate and fix it right so find something you hate can
also be a a good way to focus your 100 hours project all right remember
spaced repetition is key folks we added a lot of stuff onto your plate on
tuesday and a lot of little things that you have to start remembering and
putting into practice daily so if you're not doing your space repetition you're
not using your anki this is the time that it becomes super super important
especially as we get to the bank today especially as we get to our behavioral
and technical questions today you gotta be using your anki on a day-to-day basis
every day i need you to do two things i need you to review your anki and i need

00:21
you to do a code wars every single day if you're saying leon i want to get a
job at the end well i'm telling you what it takes and it's the yankee and a code
words a day gets the jobs to stay i'm sorry to say but space repetition is
not enough check out some random youtuber bs b s
i've helped thousands of people learn how to code i've helped hundreds of
folks get jobs and they did it through space repetition yes there are so many
techniques that can help and can jumpstart your learning
that can help you remember things for the long run but we're talking about in
a short period of time doing the things that we can do to open the doors and

00:22
help people get jobs i don't trust it i trust what i know
have worked for hundreds of people that have helped thousands of my students
learn how to code this is the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is it
i can't i can't deliver anybody else's experience except for my own and when
all my students come back to me and they
say leon thank you for making me do anki thank you for making me do space
repetition when i was in interviews and i was confident when i was in interviews
right when i was in interviews and the ideas were coming back to my brain when
i was in my behavioral interviews and things were coming out smooth and like
butter i know it was because of anki so when i have students from all over the
world telling me that it helps and is what has helped them get the jobs that's
what i'm going with i ain't listening to some random person alrighty folks

00:23
stream team we have a lot of new folks on the stream
team please make sure that you are uh taking a peek at that stream team
channel we have under the 100 dev section we have a lot of folks right we
have a lot of folks that could benefit from being in these
streams whether you're co-working you're getting some review you're getting some
follow-up right the streaming team's been putting in work
and putting in work uh and if you would like to join us give us your contact
information in this form start streaming a little bit start posting the self
promo we'd love to have you all right folks told you on tuesday
that you had a decision to make that fox saying one of us one of us

00:24
told you on tuesday that we had a decision to make right
right now there is a window that is open have no idea how long that window will
be open for it's a window that i've helped hundreds of folks get through and
on the other side of that window is a career that is well paid it is
typically with phenomenal benefits even things you can't think of some of these
offices have slides in the office like what good benefits well paid consistently
year after year one of the happiest careers
something that's high growth that you can invest in for the rest of your
working days and you don't need a degree you can learn it for free
you got to make a decision there's only ever been one thing i've noticed

00:25
between a student that got a job and the student that didn't
and they all made that decision that says you know what i know that the
trough of sorrow is long and hard and
difficult but i do not give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i am going to get through it
because i want this and once they make that decision
and they honestly make it like i see the
fire in their eyes they honestly make it things are different
the anki gets a little bit easier the code wars get a little bit easier
when you have that prize in mind when you say you know what i do not care
if today i don't feel good at this when i don't care if
tomorrow i don't feel good at this when in a month i still don't feel good at

00:26
this but you know what i want this this is something i want for myself
this is something i want for my family to know that when i have these skills i
can put food on the table i can have a happy career we make that decision
life's a little different so i don't need you to make it right now
but i hope this weekend you figure out if you want if you really
want this like honestly not kinda want it but really want it and if you really
want it don't go into your next week like an accident
because if you really want it you would plan out your week
if you really wanted it you plan out your week
you figure out what you're going to get done that week you figured out what
you're going to get done each day you would figure out how to make time
for the anki and the code wars because we don't all have the same privilege
when it comes to time with the time that you do have how are you using it
how are you planning out your week so that it's not an accident so you can

00:27
open all these doors that are gonna make the thing that you want a reality
so i can't make that decision for you i can highlight a path
i can show you what's worked for hundreds of my students and the thing i
always tell you don't listen to me don't ever listen to some random dude on
the internet that's trying to pitch you on a on a vision or a dream
because that's how you get got go look in our celebrations channel on discord
go look at our celebrations channel on discord look at the hundreds of people
hundreds of people that have gotten jobs don't listen to me
go look at the pin post i can only pin 50 of them they won't let me pin anymore

00:28
down right go look at the 50 that i pinned
and then look at all the other ones in that channel look at the people that
share on twitter hundreds of folks that have gotten jobs
thanks to the community that we've built i saw something that i was really
excited about today somebody somebody somebody that was from 100 deaths that
got a job i did i don't have their permission to like i don't want to put
them on blast i haven't talked to them yet but i'm going to talk to them and
maybe i can share what it is that they were talking about
themselves and they said something that that made me feel really good inside
they said that you know like how you say
you can say like that you're self-taught
they had that they were community taught right they came to 100 devs
they learned they worked with this community and they were community taught
i love that that's one of the best things i've ever heard
and so you don't have to listen to me go listen to the members of our stream

00:29
team go listen to our alumni go in that celebrations channel and see all the
folks that have followed this path and have gotten phenomenal jobs
there's an opportunity folks there's a window open
and you got to make a decision because the next few months i'm going to
be honest are going to be hard and not and not so much the learning the
learning yes will always be a little bit difficult
but it's a lot of work it's a lot of little things that we have to do to open
as many doors as possible and i know some people get really
stressed at this point in time but here's the deal
you don't have to open all the doors it's weird i know you don't have to open
all the doors but you have to open enough of them for the opportunities to
come your way not everyone has the same privilege when
it comes to time not everyone has the same privilege when it comes to their
loquaciousness then everyone has the same privilege of time when it comes to
interacting with other human beings so you have to open as many doors as

00:30
possible doors that feel good and are conducive to who you are
so you can have those opportunities come through not every door might be open if
you can open all of them great kudos to you but
you got to figure out which ones you can and then over the next few months work
as hard as you can to open them so i don't want to hear leon
you know what i i'm i just don't i just don't talk to humans too good great
there are so many other things on this professional checklist that has nothing
to do with talking to humans you better have the best blurb i've ever seen you
better have the best portfolio i've ever seen you guys have the best resume i've
ever seen the best github that has gifts all the way through
twitter on point linkedin on point endorsements out the wazoo an angel list
that is that is a cover letter that's for each company
cover emails for each company you better be using grammarly to make sure that

00:31
like come on none of this i'm not good at this one
part there's too many things here it's a full list thank you stephanie it's a
full list there's too much here for you to focus on one thing
we don't play that here no more there's dozens of doors to be open it's
up to you to open them cool all right while i have this open yeah somebody
said grammarly is a game changer so one thing that i do right
one thing that i do is i have a profile for each of like my
different things that i do so like i have a profile for like my personal
stuff i have a profile for 100 devs a profile for rc um a profile for
a bunch of different things like chrome profiles and that's why i can do sketchy
stuff like this and feel really comfortable at the end of the day

00:32
right because i i only use this profile for rc and teaching right
but i have different profiles for different stuff
and the cool thing about having different profiles is that you can have
different uh plugins or extensions for each of those profiles right
i can have different extensions for each of those profiles so i don't like
grammarly running on my personal stuff because what grammarly does is it reads
all the things that you type and makes you sound better
makes you sound more professional gets rid of your grammatical errors right and
so i don't want that running on like my personal stuff but all my professional
stuff hell yeah grammarly do your thing right and so
i recommend having a profile for the hunt
like a chrome profile just for the hunt where it's super focused on all the
stuff you're gonna need for the hunt including doing things like installing
grammarly so that you can i ideally fix your poor grammar because no matter how

00:33
good you think you are writing we sometimes just don't write too good and
it can help you catch stuff right so having different profiles
specifically for the hunt can be a pretty a pretty good good idea here cool
all right folks like i said doors open up to you to make that decision when you
make the decision i'm here for you gonna we're gonna we're gonna see this
thing to the end we're gonna make sure that if you want to put in the work
there's a pathway to do it we're gonna get those jobs and like i
said don't ever listen to just me don't ever listen to some other youtuber don't
ever listen to some random person on twitter always look for the proof
always talk to the folks that went through the experience and i'm telling
you just go in that celebrations and channel and see the folks who did it
all right i mentioned this on i met this on tuesday i knew it

00:34
like i said i'm going to show you how to
play the game it's up to you if you want
to play it because people hate this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people get angry
nerds and some nerds get some some get angry i get some emails i get some tweets
nerds be mad that's all i'm gonna say read it i don't i don't know that like
what i'll do is maybe on on sunday as like a fun thing i'll read out the stuff
that i got that was pretty spicy uh i'm just at the point where i am
personally just trying to ignore people like not like ignore but like i always
like i'm just not going to feed into it right you know just for my own like you
know my own like sanity but like you know i'm not going to feed into it so so
i'm just going to let it wave over but i'm just going to let you know
people get real mad i read one of the emails out on stream last time people
get real mad about this stuff and guess what i got some stuff tonight
i know i'm getting emails on like i know i'm getting an email leon you can't do

00:35
that you can't tell them to do that nah
go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself and take your gate with you know what i'm saying
all right we're gonna make them angry tonight
they're not gonna be happy about it i'm gonna be real happy about they're gonna
get angry i'm gonna get some emails i'm gonna get some tweets i might get a few
linkedin messages i don't check those though so you can send them to linkedin
all you want i'm gonna get some dms on discord which i don't read either
they won't get angry tonight that's for sure i know it the reason why people say
this is one of the best classes is because i'm giving the secrets tonight folks
giving the secrets away people that went through a four-year cs program and
didn't know all this stuff and they floundered for a year didn't get a job
and then somebody that comes out of a free boot camp making more money to them
they get mad they get angry they big mad you know what i'm saying so

00:36
i can't hang them on it either minus said as of 5 23 i'm officially a software
engineer finally making over 100k thank you for changing my life let's go
minus that's huge congratulations let's go all right come on now 10 second
warning five four three two one let's go [Music] oh [Music] hey
and we have a lot of folks recently too minus congratulations that's huge
six figures in the bank i'll take it all day
uh we have a lot of other folks recently too so we gotta we gotta i gotta do

00:37
better about putting the congratulations in the slides i'll
work on that um but we had a lot of folks coming through some folks getting
some big freelancing checks too that's wild congratulations
like i said folks don't listen to me go listen to minus all right
if you haven't already i need you to live and breathe this checklist
over the next couple of days i assigned it for homework
i signed it for homework again and guess what i assigned it for homework again
because it's important i didn't just tell you to do stuff i
gave you a checklist for the things that i need you to do
real examples you can't say leon i don't know what a portfolio looks like boom
this portfolio got somebody a job straight out of a boot camp
into a fang company one of my past students leah i don't know what goes in the

00:38
resume boom example template boom boom template example there you go can't say
nothing well i don't know what to put on my linkedin ageless boom checklist go
through it right so please make sure you work
yourself through this checklist it has all the things that you need it has good
examples for you to follow and the cool thing is if you join the linkedin group
you'll see other folks that are doing the same thing you can all work together
if you if you have questions you can post on discord or
and have other folks take a peek too like like work together on this community
all right come on now not self-study community studies let's go all right
so we got the checklist you can always do exclamation point checklist

00:39
victor hey welcome uh you can always do exclamation point checklist here in chat
if you need it uh you'll sometimes see me before class going i need that i need
that form and i'll just come in i'll use the commands here in chat because i
don't have the links is there such a thing as too many linkedin endorsements nah
no one's ever gonna be like oh this person has too many people that think
they're good at node nobody nobody's like i don't know
too many people think that he's good at react
too many folks think that uh leon's just
balling out over here with with the with the javascripts right yeah just uh nah
a little too little too good at react if you ask me cool
all right now we talked on tuesday about passing the sniff test oh

00:40
how about passing this sniff test people people don't like this
people people people get upset when i say you have a smell but you really do and
um what you have to realize is that there are some things we can do
to get past this an original sniff and if you do these things right
you can get to the technical interviews where your engineering experience the
things that you've built the things that you can do can really shine out
but most folks never make it to that stage because they do all the things we
talked about tuesday incorrectly or more importantly just don't do them at all
and so we really have to do everything we can do
to get past this original sniff test and eventually get to the point where our

00:41
technical knowledge can be the thing that seals the deal on the job okay now
once you get past that original sniff test and you get to
the engineers it comes down to two things can you code and do i want to
work with you for the next two years so tonight i'm going to show you two
techniques that have helped my students dominate this part of the process
360 slam dunk all over these interviews one is called car
the other is called prep and then i threw in a third called eu
if you can master car eu and prep you will be a lean
mean interviewing machine and when you pair that with networking and getting

00:42
referred into 60 organizations you get jobs cool all right so
just quickly to review real quick how do we get past that first sniff test cozy
welcome how we get past that first sniff test well we we we've built out our
online presence our twitter's poppin we followed 50 engineers like i asked
you to do on tuesday please tell me you started to find your
engineers right it's kind of hard to find them in the beginning but look for
hashtags from your area for your city right if you know that you're going for
remote jobs try and find some remote hashtags you can follow 50 engineers
that you can really start to interact with right getting used to that
interaction with other engineers starting to build that pipeline of folks
you might reach out to when it comes time to get really into the hunt
right i forgot a this is your reminder i got you jasmine
that's why we do our review right that's how we do our review
follow each other that's good but they if other hundred desk folks don't count

00:43
you're just all you're just all from chicago following each other and
nobody's talking to other engineers yeah make sure that they're engineers that
are in the space that are from your area uh that you could eventually
be warm leads for some of these introductions my twitter's so basic i don't have
anything to say me too me too i feel the exact same way
i just don't feel like what i have to say is worth putting out there i just
don't like i put all my stuff into like twitch i feel okay but i just don't
i don't know tweet just never made it made a thing i just it's not in me to
put tweets out there i don't know what it is i've tried hard i understand i'm
losing out on the content game but i just i i don't know i just can't i
can't do it but what i can do is interact right i love interacting with
people's stuff i like having a good list of folks that i really enjoy their
content i like it i interact with it i retweet it i'll leave comments on on
things that they're talking about like that to me is how i do twitter i'm not

00:44
really kind of like making twitter threads and sharing my
soul it's just this is not something i feel comfortable with right
it's not something i feel comes with so what i do is i use it as an interaction
right interaction is the only thing that matters on twitter anyway right
yeah like i said you find those 50 you like retweet you go from acquaintances
to people that they're going to like you somebody has 300 followers they're an
engineer at a company in your town and you're liking their stuff you're leaving
good comments you're interacting with them they're going to like you and
they're going to talk to you they're going to give you a coffee chat it could
lead to a referral that's why we do these 50. it really does help get you
used to interacting with other engineers that's something that's a little
asynchronous it's at your own pace it can help you start warming up to this
networking idea so i really do like this pattern first
especially if you're somebody that's really nervous about the networking
portion or the talking the humans portion that's where twitter can be a big tool
for you it can really help you kind of grease the wheels

00:45
and and get comfortable engaging with folks in a way that seems a little lower
risk right i can like and retweet right that's that's something i think i can do
if i go by a nickname what should i do for linkedin uh you can go buy a moniker
like you can always use a you can always use a nickname yeah i think that's
totally fine as long as that's what you go by
professionally um also every cohort i have some folks that can't use their
real name um they use the name their the name that they've chosen right
and so for some reason there's a security reason they can't use their
real name or things like that that's totally okay you can use a moniker a lot of
developers go by monikers that are not their actual real name
you can use that across all your profiles if you don't feel comfortable
like if there's a if there's a danger to you using a real photo
you can use i see folks that do kind of cartoonerize versions of their photos

00:46
bitmoji type things do things that are going to make you safe and secure
above kind of like putting your name everywhere right so if there are those
things you're dealing with that's okay to do it we've had folks do that last
cohort and still we're successful you might just have to explain a thing or
two when you get to the offer stage at a company that's all and that's an easy
conversation to have or easy once you practice it
shout out the cast you do have the best monograph yeah for real right uh what
did the engineer only post non-tech stuff that's fine that's good
cool would you recommend a business name not really you don't want to go by your
business name as you're like interacting
with these folks and the other thing too is that most employers are going to
google you by doing all these things and using the same name

00:47
and you connect your twitter to your linkedin to your angel list you connect
your your portfolio like once you start connecting all these things with the
same name google starts to rank that name higher and so when you're in these
interviews or you're trying to get past that sniff test you'll rank higher and
people will be able to find you a little bit easier
i had a cartoon remember my github and linkedin still got a job in tech yeah
like as long as you're being consistent is not something that's too wild like
you'll be fine definitely a picture of yourself is best
but not everyone has that privilege elektra's code hey thank you for the
five subs thanks for being here cool um if you have not yet you should join our
100 devs group i'm asking you to join the 100 devs
group i'm asking you to connect with at least five individuals from that group
randomly and uh then endorse them for javascript
node and react please that's how we get the algorithm going folks get the

00:48
trainer moving by doing this i added like a thousand plus people over the
over the last day or so and so if you haven't done that yet join the group
i'll add you after class i looked in picture that was 12 years
old now doesn't really matter i think mine's about the same i think mine's
about 12 years old too you know double my endorsements let's go hey tony
stark that's awesome cool what'd i do if i got locked out of my
linkedin give it a little bit of time and try again cool alrighty
remember we're committing to pushing our code every day we're doing a code war
every day but we're also pushing our code every day and the reason why we are

00:49
pushing our code every single day is because recruiters love those green squares
got more endorsements now than i did 10 years in my previous industry hey sydney
i'd love to hear that recruiters love their green squares they do it they do
they do right and so you should be doing your code wars every day and then you
should be pushing that code wars to github if you're saying leon i don't
know how to push my code wars to github go and watch our get review class it's a
vod here on twitch watch that class we literally show you
how to create the repo add your code and push it to github get those green
squares it really does help if a recruiter chooses to look at your github
show us how to hack green squares hello trufio who led the raid here today they
have a stream and they have a vaude where they walk through how to backfill
your green squares just saying rufio if you can share me if you could
send me the link to that vod or if you put it on youtube

00:50
or something send me that and i'll send it out with the um
follow-up message to class or our class on tuesday if you're still here you know
that way more folks can find it cool all right and we're doing all these things
uh because we don't want to be one of these people that apply to 400
applications with no luck now we said the most important thing
that we're going to do we're going to talk about the most important thing that
we had to do and then we're going to move into our break when we come back
from break i'm showing you the two most important things you're going to need to
get through your technical interviews before we get there
i said the most important thing you're going to need to get the interviews is
your hit list this hit list is probably the most
important thing you'll do for your career at least for all my students that have
gotten amazing jobs the thing that helped them get the jobs was this hit list

00:51
the hit list is the idea you can use the sheet if you use the sheet you'll see
that there is this lovely hit list tab where you can put the companies that
you're interested that have a role that's a good fit for you
and your point of contacts at that company this is not something you have
to be obese at yet this is not something you have to be good at yet we're going
to have a whole class on just building out your hit list that's right folks you
heard me say it right a whole class just on building out your hit list
i know there's some things you're kind of like leon i don't know how to really
go about don't worry we're gonna have full classes on a lot of this stuff one
of them is our hit list but doesn't mean you can't start trying now
and so with your hit list you use that sheet you're going to find 60 companies
ideally locally to you or if you're going remote you've got to
find those companies that'll hire you remotely
right 60 companies that you're going to network your way into
then you're going to find the hiring manager at those companies you're going

00:52
to find the engineers on the team at that company you're going to find the
recruiters at that company and there's a process to doing this you can following
them on twitter you can find their emails using hunter io you can find them
on angels you can find them on linkedin right there's a process to this but you
need to find them and you need to add them to your hit list and then start
engaging with them try and get a coffee chat try and get on their radar provide
some value so that we can eventually get the referral cool
remember we said no longer uh we're not going to reach out to the mamas anymore
we've deemed that not the right thing to do uh so so no mom at this time but
definitely hiring manager engineer in the team recruiter cool
and the name of the game folks is never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever

00:53
ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
ever work ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
it was at this moment that he knew he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up ever ever click apply
never ever just click apply now somebody's gonna be like leon but my
cousin's uncle's brother's best friend twice removed they just clicked apply
and they got a job great that's good to know
i'm glad it worked for them remember everything we're doing throughout this

00:54
process is to open as many doors as possible right
to open as many doors as possible you could skip out on some of these things
that's okay but you're not opening that door and so all of this is about opening
doors the more the things we do the more doors that open
this is one of the bigger ones just clicking apply really doesn't work
because you're going up against folks that were referred and recommended so if
you're not getting that referral you're not going to recommend it it's going to
be harder especially if you're coming from a non-traditional background
right if you're coming from a non-traditional background and you're
just clicking apply and you're going up against folks to
have a four-year cs degree and an internship returning their belt
it's just not going to work out so never ever just click apply
that's a good way to get your resume balled up and thrown in the trash can cool

00:55
we we committed to this idea that all right we're going to network our way
into 60 applications we're going to get 60 referrals 30 of them are going to be
high value applications where we do custom resumes a custom story about why
we're interviewing we're going to have 10 premium applications where we do all
the other stuff plus we're tweeting about the company we're we're making a
maybe a blog post about the the the area in which that company operates maybe we
build a little one the two day project that shows that we can build stuff
that's in the realm of that company we're gonna talk through how to do all
this don't worry um but that means you have 30 high value
10 premium and like 20 that are just normal referred applications you do your
21st right the 21st where everything goes wrong you find your footing you
find out what works what doesn't work you find out where your weaknesses are
when it comes to interviewing everyone has a weakness when it comes to
interviewing the goal is to find out what that thing is so you can fix it so

00:56
we do that with our 20 that are just fodder then we focus on our 30 and we
wrap up with our premium so by the time you get to your premium you've been a
leaning interviewing machine for a while welcome king cool
you're also committing to a hundred hours project the hundred dollars
project is one of the most important things you'll do throughout this program
where you will sync 100 hours into building an application that is a full
stack web application when you go into interviews it's a project you can show
this is what i built this is what i can do it ties your story to why you're an
engineer now we'll talk a little bit more about that
for sure in the coming weeks and due next week i want a description of your
100 hours project and a very very simple wireframe just a very uh simple
drawing of what your project's going to look like you want to get fancy and use

00:57
free tools like wireframe cc or figma go
for it but you can even just draw it and take a photo of it i don't really care
when do we physically start in 100 project tonight because you're going to
start thinking about what it's going to be and i want an idea next week cool
all right now we mentioned that this is a lot but the folks that commit to this
process when that switch flips in their brain
it's something that they want so they're going to do what it takes
this is how you get jobs folks this is how you get jobs you do this
process you do these things you open these doors this is what has continually

00:58
helped my students get jobs cool all right folks we're at the top of the hour
let's go ahead and take our break if you're new around here so many new folks
welcome glad to have you glad you feel free to join we have a 30 week software
engineering bootcamp everything you need to go from never having touch code
before to employable but around here we like to be healthy
learning decode is a marathon not a sprint you can't thug it out we're gonna
take our breaks and so we're gonna put five minutes on
the clock if you're able please get up move around hydrate let your eyes focus

00:59

01:00

01:03
on something that's not the screen and we'll be back in five [Music]
all right folks come on back don't let these uh jazzy tunes drift you away

01:04
got some work to get into [Music] or do we
alrighty folks come on back come on back let's get into this
heisenberg welcome congrats on getting to class too it's awesome glad to have
you alrighty so we talked about everything we need to do to get interviews
but tonight we gotta spend some time learning how to do the interviews
and my goal is to maybe you know and a little early so you have some time to
think about your 100 hours project maybe uh start thinking through some of
these car and prep things on your own so we're gonna try and get there all right

01:05
so we've done everything to open as many doors as possible we got some we got
some inbound interest coming we got some hit list building that we've done right
we've got some hit list things that we've done and so now we need to talk
about interviewing and the actual interviewing process so there is a process
to interviewing now every company is different right
every every company is different right every company is different and
what we have to realize is that this is a general overview
but each company might use some of this it might use all of it they might use
none of it but generally after i've seen hundreds if not thousands of different
companies through my time at rc this is kind of the process that i've

01:06
come across right and so typically there is kind of three points
to kicking off the interview process you
applied to a job you got recruited for a job and you got recommended for a job
applying is definitely the worst recruited means that anything could have
happened like a recruiter reached out to you a recruiter might have found you on
linkedin or something like that and then the third and the most important why
it's highlighted is you got recommended for a job
when you get recommended like we all are going to you can sometimes skip
a few steps in the process i have seen when
some love to disdain for applying yes thank you i have seen when some folks get
recommended that they will literally skip a phone screen they will literally
skip a behavioral and they'll go right to the technical portion of the interview

01:07
so that's why recommendation recommends recommendations can be so powerful not
only do you actually get an interview but in a lot of companies you can skip
some of the first rounds of the interview which is pretty powerful and so
let's say that it's not a company that skips around you get your recommendation
into the company there are some steps that you might go through in a normal
interview process typically these days there is a phone
screen where you're going to work with a recruiter the phone screen is just a
fancy word for what just a fancy word for what
what do you think the phone screen is it's just a fancy word for the sniff
test right are you a person right are you a person that should be wasting

01:08
our engineering managers time or not right it is the sniff test they're gonna
figure out what your background is they're going to figure out if you're a
good fit for the role all the phone screen really is is just a
sniff test right if you get past that original sniff test you'll typically be
plopped into a behavioral interview don't worry we're going to go through
like all things to prepare but the behavioral interview is kind of like the
normal interviews that you might be aware of like the tell me about your
greatest strength tell me about your greatest weakness like those types of
questions that we just so happen what leon you need to tell me that there
are 22 behavioral questions that i can prepare that are on these magical list
of questions that you've prepared for us
yes that is true there are 22 behavioral questions that you can prepare for huh
interesting cool so you have the behavioral question where it's not
really any technical questions but it's questions about who you are what you've
done what you've built and why you might be a good fit for the role
if you get through the behavioral then you kind of get to the technical portion

01:09
of the interview and this is where it's kind of different in every company and
it's also very different as we're coming to coming out of the tail end of the
pandemic i'm starting to see more in-person interviews again but the bulk
are still remote which is pretty awesome um but
there's kind of a mix of what can happen here
um sometimes you'll get asked technical questions so you'll have some questions
where you'll sit down with an engineer on the team they'll ask you about your
projects things that you've built they'll ask you about kind of just your
general knowledge you'll talk about javascript you'll talk about i don't
know we'll talk about some of the nitty gritty bits bits of javascript that
we'll learn about when we get to node right and so they're just trying to
obsess where you are technically but it's more conversational
you could also have a take home a take home is where they give you a
problem to work on anywhere from an hour
to a day like i've seen that kind of the range like normally an hour to three
hour problem that you could work on typically they give you some
documentation and there's a pretty clear end goal

01:10
you write your code you submit it there could also be a whiteboarding
session where you whiteboard either remotely or in person where you're given
a coding challenge and you have to write out your code on the whiteboard or type
it out in a text editor and then sometimes there are in-person interviews where
it can be anywhere from one interview to like five interviews in one day where
you meet with engineers to have conversations we meet with engineers to
solve coding challenges together sometimes you'll pair program it can
really be a bunch of different stuff but this process like i said is
different every company but that's kind of a range of what you can expect we're
going to break down today what a behavioral looks like and what you can
study and how to do it we're also going to break down how to do the technical
portions and what you can study and how to do it and then some companies do what
i like to call the wine and dine interview where they already know they
want to hire you but they want you to like meet the team you're going to want

01:11
to go out to dinner stuff like that and then you get an offer
bells of abba hey thank you for the five kids at subs hope you're doing well
thank you for being here right and then there's the offer stage once
you get to the offer stage the gloves come off you can ask all the things that
you want to that you want to know about the company you can negotiate
we'll have a whole class on how to negotiate but this is kind of the
general process that you can expect are you going to break down system design
we're going to cover that when we get to
more of our technical interview practice so tonight's about kind of some things
you can start putting into place today but we're going to have whole nights
where we practice this stuff together cool so far i can get to behavioral but
nothing after that that's actually a good sign that means that your your
recruitment process is working well you're getting that inbound interest but
a lot of people fumble in the behavior and we're going to talk about why that

01:12
might be and they just basically don't pass that sniff test they don't ever get
to the technical or as we have to say getting to the nerds yeah
should you tell a recruiter your salary range before an interview hell no
here's here's the magical words i got i'm telling you folks this is what i do
you ask me what i do i get people jobs is what i do
if somebody asks you what your your expected salary range is you just say
fair market rate for a developer of my skill set and experience
they say oh what are you looking for in terms of this role fair market rate for
a developer of my skill set and experience leon well what is that number
come on bob you do this way more than i do i know this is the fifth call you had
today i know you're going to talk to three more engineers tomorrow you
definitely know what fair market rate for developer my skill set experience is

01:13
and as long as we're in that ballpark i'm okay
and then if they give you a little bit more pushback here's how you seal the
deal they're they're like leon now but really i need a number
what have you budgeted for the role got him
right so fair market rate for developer my skill set and experience if they push
they push you say well i mean you do this all day what if you budget it for
the roll boom it's over they got got all right so this is the process
you'll get recommended you may have a phone screen you'll do behavioral which
is kind of like the normal interview type questions you might be familiar
with then there's some technical portion it could be a take-home it could be
meeting with an engineer it could be doing whiteboarding and solving coding

01:14
challenges in person and then you might have like a wine and
dine and then you just get an offer what i've been seeing the most right now
like the process i've seen with maybe dozens or so companies over the past
month or so is that a lot of companies are doing a phone screen
with a recruiter that's very short a behavioral where you're meeting with
one person on the team then a take home and then a um
like a whiteboarding thing but it's it's digital
so you'll do like a phone screen a behavioral a take home
and then you'll do coding challenges with someone and the coding challenges
really haven't been like a whiteboard where you're
physically drawing we've done a lot in the past uh you're opening up like a
code editor you're sharing your screen or you're using one of the platforms
like coderpad and you're typing out similar to like what a code wars would

01:15
be a type problem all right so that's kind of what i'm seeing right now
like i said most of my experience is folks in the boston philadelphia
pittsburgh area i do work with quite a few remote folks as well so that's what
i'm seeing but your area might be different cool now once you get recommended
there's certain things you have to do as you go through this process and so
once you get recommended there's one thing that i really need you to do
and that's for you to have a crystal clear picture
of what the steps in the process are never ever

01:16
go into your interviews like an accident always know what you're going into
i can't tell you how many students i've talked to in the past they're like leon
i was so nervous i didn't know what i was expecting and i'm like
what do you mean you know what you're expecting did you ask them
what type of interview you were going into here's the dirty secret most
interviewers want to help you you just gotta ask so
always ask whoever your contact is hey i have an interview scheduled for friday
can you tell me what to expect in that interview
should i expect a behavioral should i expect a technical right oh it's
behavioral how much time what should i plan to go through this behavioral
interview wonderful thank you so much oh i have a technical schedule for
friday can you give me an example of something i might encounter during this
technical will be more questions will be more kind of code wars leak code type
problems should i be prepared to whiteboard right you ask

01:17
don't go into your interviews like an accent you should never show up for an
interview and be surprised what you're going to be doing right
cool so always know what you're walking into always know what to expect ask
clarifying questions it it it doesn't like you got to realize
that teams love this teams want a person that's inquisitive
that's going to ask that's going to be prepared that's trying to get to know
them right so you gotta ask don't ever um don't ever go into an interview not
knowing what you're getting into it's gonna take some stress off your
shoulders it's gonna make sure that you're prepared the best for it and i
mean sometimes they lie sometimes you get got that's gonna happen they might
tell you one thing and something else might happen but at least
you're not going in um unprepared cool now
this is where i get the most tape this is where i'm gonna get an email if

01:18
you're gonna send me an email just save yourself some time i'm not gonna respond
to you you don't send me an email i'm not gonna read it don't don't don't dm
me on twitter like i'm just i just don't care
your opinion doesn't mean anything to me um this is where i that's where i get
the most this is where i get the most tape all right once you recommend it
it is your job imagine a scenario where if you googled
somebody gives you eighty 80 000 or more right imagine just by googling
somebody could hand you 80 000 or more right because once you get recommended
it is now your job to scour the internet for every single thing
about their process every single thing that companies going

01:19
to do in an interview you need to know google the crap out of them go on
glassdoor go on github go on blind right i mean google like somebody's
gonna hand you an 80k check if you figure out everything about their
interview process because it's out there folks
the number of folks that go through an interview and then put the questions on
glassdoor is astronomical the number of folks that will strip
share their interview questions on blind is
astronomical the number of folks that'll submit a coding challenge and then push
their code to github is out of this world home let me show you something
i'm gonna do it live too hold on let me let me pull up my tab here where's my
mouse there we go i gotta do here just so i don't get got one second
cool all right here's my github let's let's let's let's name it i've

01:20
done this before so i know this will exist let's do like spotify interview
oh not and not in leon that's when i google like github generally all of gender
look at this [Laughter] you got got look at it come on now some of these are old
some of these are old but some of these are from not that long ago
you can see all this stuff oh the exact question
oh my god this must be their front end question the exact question

01:21
front end interview spotify co coding challenge
and like not only is it the question but it's their their freaking answer to it
right come on now folks so once you know you got an interview
coming up you gotta go to town go through glassdoor go through github
go through blind go through reddit go through google like if you find the
answer somebody's gonna hand you an 80 000 check now
the things i get is leon you can't tell them to do this no get out
take your gate with you get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of my face right
what do you think i'm gonna do on the job
is that legal why would it not be legal to google to google of course is legal
is it legal what do you think i'm going to do on the job all day long

01:22
i'm gonna google my ass off all day long so you know what
if they ask the same questions that they know the interview
that they're going to ask in the interview if they ask the same questions
that they already know are googleable you know what
if they ask the same questions that they
already know are googleable i'm going to take that as a sign that they wanted me
to google it i'm gonna assume that's part of the test
i'm gonna assume that they're gonna think that i am
dumb for not having googled it found the question they were going to ask
and came in prepared i would think less of you if you didn't do it
so so many of these companies know their process is out there but i can't tell
you how many people are so bad at interviewing that they don't even google

01:23
the company they don't even google the question they don't even take time to
prepare for that company so the company's not switching up their process
that's because they don't care they want you to know it they want to know that
you are prepared going into this interview so please do everything in your power
to research and find out about this company to know what you're walking into
and be prepared cool so we've got interviews we know what we're doing
we we're not going to walk into this interview like an accident we we've
asked the interviewers hey what should i
expect we know that we have a behavioral coming up we know we have a technical
coming up we've done our best 100 device try to google the crap out of the

01:24
company to find any past questions to use as part of our prep to find anything
we can about the company to prep um so now we've we're prepared but how do we
prepare to go into those behaviorals how do we prepare to go into those
technicals right so this is how i ask my student to prepare is something
that's helped them time and time again to get good jobs all right
first thing is the bank there's another
thing engineers hate this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i don't
know why they hate it but they hate it they they hate that i give you this link
this is called the bank the bank is a list of problems that i
want you to practice we have the behavioral questions there
are 22 behavioral questions on here that you need to be a lean mean carrying
machine which we're going to cover in a few seconds

01:25
and then there are 300 technical questions that you are going to have memorized
that are all going to go into your anki and when you show up in an interview and
somebody asked you about polymorphism boom you got them when somebody asks you
about what a callback in node.js is boom you
got them when somebody asks you uh what what's what's a high order function you
got them right all these things that not only will you know
but you've ankied so much you're gonna be smooth it's gonna come out like butter
you're gonna be sitting in that chair being like yeah mm-hmm
this is how i answer this question boom you hit him with it hit him with that
knowledge right and they're they're asking these wild questions and you're
like boom right off the dome my friend i got this
i got you let me explain hold on sit up sit up a little bit for me yep sit down
you got it cool i got you boom here you go here's how you explain that right it

01:26
comes out smooth because you've practiced every single day for three months
these questions so when you're in a technical interview
and they're asking you some questions you're not gonna fumble you're not gonna
be like i don't know no you're gonna have a bank of questions to fall back on
now is every question on this list no but there's enough here
so that you can make up something on the spot
based on the work you put in for all of these questions
there's 22 behavioral questions on here not every behavioral question you're
going to have is going to be on here but there's enough raw material here
that if you prepare these 22 behavioral questions you can answer every

01:27
behavioral question that comes your way there will not be a single question you
get asked that if you did not put in the effort for these 22 that you won't be
good at right then when it comes to having conversations
with engineers and you're just talking through your project you're talking
through technical stuff boom you have all these things off the dome
that you know that you feel comfortable with and so you'll never get asked the
question and go i'm sorry i don't know about that you'll
go oh well i have used this and i like this for this reason and i've
used it in this scenario right and that's kind of similar to the thing that
you were asking about right so you'll never just say i don't know right
juicebox hero hey thank you if i get themselves hope you're doing well thank
you for being here i gotta you called me out i feel bad i'm
sorry i owe you uh i owe you a a uh twitter message i'll hit you up

01:28
i'll send you a message after stream i'm sorry she came from my neck
that came from my neck all right so we have our behavioral questions [Music]
thank you i appreciate you juice box i really do thank you uh
so we have our behavioral questions that
set up our behavioral interviews we have our technical questions that set us up
to do well during our technical you were gonna add these questions to
your anki deck you're gonna practice them every day when you're when you're
brushing your teeth boom you're walking working through some
of these questions right it becomes something that is a part of you for the
next few months so that when you are in an interview right

01:29
when you're in an interview it's smooth it's crisp right cool now
are there answers to all these questions yes
there are some folks that have filled out the bank and have shared it on discord
but we know for space repetition and active recall to work that you're way
better off filling these out yourself and the reason why it's way better if
you film out yourself is that it'll be in your voice
you're going to be the person that needs to answer these questions so it should
be in your voice it should be based on the things that you remember and
understand and know so you could find somebody else's answers but it's not
going to be the same so don't do yourself that disservice put in the time
to work through these questions to understand them to know them in your own
voice so that when you're an interview you know what to do all the resources
and the places to find like answers to these questions uh could be found pretty

01:30
much in these like articles here um a lot of these questions come from other
other person like other people's um collection of questions i've just put
together the ones i think are really important
uh there's also some questions to ask your interviewer for when you get to
that stage uh everything is here for you cool
we passionately refer to this as banky at 100 devs and so i really hope that
over the next few months you take some time to do banky sessions i know
myself and some members of the stream team will stream banky
i know some folks like to get on discord and do banky we had a group last cohort
that every day during lunch did banky for three months
literally every day every day at lunch they would get on together and they
would work through banky questions on discord
find community on on discord do the same thing this should be part of you you're
doing your anki every day you're doing your code wars every day if you do this
if you do come on now if you do if you do banky and a cold wars every

01:31
day for three months do you think you're not going to be ready for technical
interviews do you not think you're going to be a
lean mean interviewing machine it's it's it's a lot of work
but it the path's clear there's no way you open all the doors
that we just talked about opening on tuesday and tonight and then there's no
way if you do your banky and your code wars every day that you're not ready for
interviews there's no way no way you're not ready and you know what
other folks are not doing this they're just not folks coming out of
other boot camps don't do this other folks coming out of other boot
camps do not do this other folks coming out of a four year cs program definitely
don't do this they learned something four years ago and forgot about it you
are studying questions every single day you're doing code challenges every day
you also have 100 hours project you also have real clients do you understand how

01:32
people got jobs now right we're doing stuff that other
people don't want to do and that's how we 360 slam dunk all over their face and
get these jobs it's not magic maybe a little magic give me a little magic
it's a lot of work abracadabra that's um like one of my favorite videos of all
time is uh the loiter scott the lord of squads abracadabra abracadabra
it's so good all right where can i download more discipline make your bed

01:33
make your bed every day all right so we got the bank
now in the bank are these behavioral questions okay
so how do we actually answer these behavioral questions
there is a tried and true method for answering behavioral questions
and it's called car cause action result every single question
on the behavioral questions you should have a three sentence answer to the cause
the action and the result so the cause is what happened like what happened
the action is the action you took to solve that cause
and then the result is why are you the best engineer ever

01:34
because of how you solved that problem the cause what happened action the
action you took and the r is the result how are you god's gift to earth
based off of how that the action that you took
right and you want to have those three sentence answers for all 22
of these questions cause action result cause there's some key words here
right there's some key words here uh somebody said what if we get hit up
by recruiters now we don't have the bank completed i got messaged by an amazon
recruiter what should i pursue the magic words i got a lot of magic
words for tonight so i said a little bit of magic right i've been doing this for
a while the magic word is hi i'm not currently
pursuing new opportunities at the moment but i would love to reconnect in three

01:35
months can we set up a time to talk three months from now
that's it that's the magic word you're gonna if you if you're opening
all these doors you're gonna have recruiters reaching out to you and when
those recruiters reach out to you what you want to say is hey i'm not
pursuing new opportunities because when you say i'm not pursuing new
opportunities that means it sounds like you're happy at your job you can't pay
me enough to to apply right but i'd be interested maybe three months
from now and then you set up a time so it's already on the calendar so they
can't forget about you right it's on the calendar you have the
call and in three months you'll be ready kobe hey welcome cool
so to answer car cause there's like two key words i really like
are two ways to start off your cause at my last company

01:36
or at my last opportunity at my last company or at my last opportunity
at my last company i helped four thousand universities bring their
academic research online at my last opportunity i worked with a
team of developers to build web applications for numerous clients
and my last company are my last opportunities
if you say the word bootcamp you have lost if you say the words 100 devs
you have lost there is no need for you to put information out there
that doesn't need to be out there in the beginning
say one more time if you mentioned the word boot camp
you have lost the interview you might as well pack up and go home
because that introduces the smell number one rule exactly don't snitch

01:37
juice box what about butt camp [Laughter] don't stitch on yourself let them dig
let them dig what are the 100 of course 100 devs on
your resume doesn't mean you have to say the words i'm talking about when you're
in a behavioral interview right when you're in the behavior when
you're interviewed you don't have to mention these things
right you can just say at my last company my last opportunity because 99
of the time well not nine percent i'm gonna say ninety percent of the time
they're this there to hear you say something so they can ask the next question
ninety percent of the time if you don't set off any of their alarm bells
they're just going to move on to the next question and if they get through

01:38
all their questions they they give you the technical interview right so no need
to snitch on yourself out the gate no need to mention anything that might
make them look at their resume again right you let them dig but 90 of the time
they're just gonna listen to what you say and move on to the next thing unless
you raise the alarm bells so if you say at my last boot camp boom alarm bells
going off boot camp either bootcamp you're a bootcamper i don't know about
that did you really learn everything you need to learn like you don't say it
100 devs 100 sounds good it's got some cachet oh what's 100 death now you're no
longer answering the question that they asked you're talking about 100 devs
which is great you can say 100 is an agency with a
training program i went through that training program i worked with some
great clients or you could do that but it would have just been better and

01:39
easier if you set up my last company at my last opportunity and then answered
your car because cars should be three sentences
cause action result anything else is extra and is stopping you from moving
through the interview cool let them dig if they want to dig action
what are the steps you took to solve the thing that happened that
caused that happen right it must be positive
there's no time to be humble during the hunt we are hunting
we are hunting no time to be humble we're dressed for war no time to be humble

01:40
must be positive no well i stumble in the night trip didn't it no no
time to be positive right everything should be positive
everything should be upbeat no time to be humble during the hunt
all right so cause what happened action what did you do positive thing
that you did to solve that cause and result how are you better because of
what happened how are you the best thing since sliced bread because of the
actions you took now some folks are like leon i don't i
don't know how to and like what that's why we practice
some folks are like leon i talk too much
lee and i talk too little leon i have no idea how to answer these questions
that's why we practice three months ahead of time before you start actually
interviewing that's why we practice three months before we start actually
interviewing that's why we're gonna have a cause

01:41
action result memorized for each one of these
and it's gonna we're gonna have it so dialed in because the anki
that when they ask us a question cause action result boom it's gonna sound
smooth you're gonna you're gonna be calm you're
gonna be cool you're gonna be collected and that's going to come across
right when you're cool calm and collected that comes across in the
interview as capable comes across as knowledgeable it comes
across as somebody i want on my team and so many folks
that get stuck at the behavioral stage is because they didn't practice the
questions they didn't have real good examples they didn't have things that
they had worked on that they could throw out
that actually sounded plausible real that sounded natural that that helped
you get past that sniff test and into the technical
and that's why we start now if you're like leon i don't know how to answer
these questions great we're going to have classes where i show you how to

01:42
answer these questions every single person here by the time you graduate
will have enough experience at 100 devs to answer all these questions i don't
care if you've never done anything else besides 100 devs you can answer all
these behavioral questions based on what we did here during our time together
because you will all have worked with clients or volunteered or contributed to
free software you will all have worked in teams you will all have worked on
sprint teams where you've built real products you will all have committed to
100 hour projects you will all had plenty of nights where we did this practice
together so if you don't have anything right now
a month or so you'll have enough for each and every single thing on this list
now if you can sprinkle in your past experience that's great not everybody

01:43
has that privilege all righty let's do it live
i haven't prepped these in forever let's see if we can do some cause action
result together all right let's bring up the inspector here
let's see if we can get like an actual question some of these are like weird
ones but let's see if we can actually get like a real question
all right 17. hopefully that's like an actual question
why are you interested in this opportunity wonderful all right thank
you for your time today so at my last opportunity i had the
chance to lead a large engineering team and helped new engineers start their
careers i'm looking for a team that is helping the educational space
and i want to bring my wealth of experience as an engineering manager to

01:44
a team where i can build real products that help real customers particularly
folks that are trying to change their careers and or find jobs that they love
so i'm interested in this opportunity because i feel i can satisfy all those
goals and help build wonderful software right this one's really not like a kari
problem it's kind of harder to fit car in here right but
one of the things that you're going to see throughout all my questions
is what there's only one theme through all my questions
and that one theme i'm going to bring up no matter what question you asked me
is engineering manager i've led engineering teams or something in that vein of
build like building with teams leading teams engineering manager because that's
the type of roles i'm going to go after right so that's the type of roles that
i'm going to go after you're going to hear that theme
throughout all my answers we're going to
do some more we're going to do some more and we're going to have whole nights

01:45
where we practice this right but i'm going to have those themes
throughout my answers because what happens at the end of these interviews right
excuse me and everyone knows this but at the end
at the end of your interviews the person that is interviewing you fills out like
a form that says like higher strongly higher do not hire strongly do not hire
that's it you like you like you you you sign
you like they literally they literally check off a box and then write like what
they remember about you and so when that person checks
strongly higher i also want them to write engineering manager in that little box
that's it that's what i want to remember
right so you're going to notice that all my kari questions
kind of have the same theme because i understand the game that i am

01:46
playing i understand that if i get through this somebody's going to say
strongly higher and they're going to remember the few things that they
remember and so the way that we can
game this is by saying the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over and over again right
so you're going to notice some themes in my answers all right let's try this
again hopefully we get like an actual real question here my math right
none of these are like the last ones are like not the actual questions
oh cool tell me about a time you failed great question
all right tell me what time you failed great question alrighty
so at my last opportunity we had a very important client that
needed a specific piece of software and i decided to push a change live to

01:47
production late on a friday that code failed it brought down the
site not only for that customer but 4 000 other of our customers and that
night i stayed up with the team to fix that bug but we also put in systems and
strategies so that never happened again we made sure to have a team decision to
never push code live on fridays we built in new testing infrastructure to make
sure things that would break didn't make it to production and
after that change for the four extra years that i led that team as an
engineering manager we never had a breaking build make it to production and
we kept our 99.99 uptime boom car cause action result
what did i do i made a big mistake i pushed code to production what's the
action i took i put a a a cultural change in place and a
technical change in place i put a cultural change that we don't push code

01:48
live on fridays we put a technical change in place where our code is not
tested things that break can't make it to production and the result well i led
a team hint hint and we had her uptime going forward for the next four years
cause action result i have not made a technical mistake
honestly so i don't know what to say bs we've all made mistakes we all have
gone to the console and had and had something not work right one of my
one of my favorite answers to this question right one of my one of my favorite
answers this question was i once spent three days trying to fix my
code only to realize that it was a curly brace so from that point forward i used
linting so that i would never have to worry about missing my curly braces ever

01:49
again and you'll be happy to know that i have never missed a curly brace in the
past four years right like like that was a legitimate answer i had somebody
answered that in an interview and i was like that's the best answer i've ever
heard to this question so i don't care where you're at there are ways to answer
these questions you just have to put a little bit of thought into it you have
to think through and answer honestly these things should be like real right
and you're all going to have some like you have you have time to
think through these you don't have to be like i'm doing them off the dome now
because i've done this right like i used to practice these it's been a few years
but i practiced these until my eyes bled
and like i i knew my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right so yeah
i'm doing them off the dome right now but it's something i put a serious
amount of time in to get better at and so once again my car brought up this
engineering manager theme and you're gonna notice that all my answers do it
so every answer should be based off of our clients and not our past experience
no you can definitely sprinkle in your past experience as long as you have a

01:50
good story right you have a good story that ties what you did in the past
to what you are doing now and that's why
crafting your story is the first thing i asked you all to do
right it doesn't matter what your past experience was as long as you have that
story that brings you to the current point and and why all the things that
you did in the past make you a better engineer
i don't care if you like i i've had folks that have crushed this that that
had the the completely different careers that they were able to spin into
experience to why they were showing up at my door
and so that's what we got to think through why we spend this time that's
why i asked you to start crafting your story so we're going to have specific
nights typically on fridays where we walk through this stuff together we're
going to have another crafting your story class
you can watch the unlisted youtube video where i craft five alumni stories live
then we're gonna do it again together with this cohort then we're gonna have

01:51
nights where we practice car we have nights where we practice prep
right this is the start of the next three months of our lives
so it's okay if we don't come out the gate bangers we're gonna work on this
together the unlisted video is on discord it's in the
materials i think from last class all right
civic thunder said i need to pee really bad can we take a break absolutely all
right let's go ahead and take a break so civic can go pee
we are at the top of the hour when we come back from our break if you're new
around here we do five-minute breaks uh to make sure that we're staying healthy
it's a marathon not a sprint when we come back from our break
we're gonna move into technical questions these secrets the tips that
you need to do well during your technical we've laid the foundation for

01:52
our behavioral now we get to our technical so i will see you all in five
minutes civic hope everything goes well alrighty folks see in five i'm gonna run

01:56

01:57
some ads you actually have to take a break peace lang [Music]
thanks jr appreciate it where's the music oh there we go
matt catch the vod go go go enjoy your date good luck
now the clan tag is the whole bit it's it's the whole thing oh
wrong headphones i'm like where's the music i have the wrong headphones in
you're like leon two sets of headphones yeah i got it like that's you know you
know what i'm saying all right folks come on back come on back [Laughter]

01:58
that engineering manager salary now it's pd funds alrighty folks
schedule saturday to complete my behavioral questions and some readiness dope
can you check the celebration section thank you for everything then
i appreciate that thank you all right folks
come on back come on back we got to get into the the meat meet tonight folks we
we got we got through the behavioral now we got to get through the technical
bangers only 14 hey thank you for the fire get this
subs thank you for being here appreciate it alrighty

01:59
alrighty folks let's get into it all right so there's kind of two phases to the
technical right we talked about there could be a chance
where you sit down and you're talking with an engineer and you kind of are
answering some questions you can show your project things like that
this happens for a lot of my students interviewing remember i told you that
about half my students did not have technical interviews and
when i say they didn't have technical interviews i mean that they didn't do a
coding challenge like a take-home challenge or a whiteboarding or like a
live coding challenge they had behaviorals
they answered technical questions they showed their projects they did things
like that so about half of them that's where it stops
and so you want to make sure that you feel really comfortable in these
conversations you're going to have with engineers we're going to practice you
talking about your 100 hours project we're going to practice

02:00
talking about technical questions and just like we had car for behavioral we
have eu for our technical questions cool ma yeah join the ketchup crew you're
good we got you catch your cruise exactly for your situation
all right we have eu right explanation use example
right eu explanation use example so for all of the technical questions that we
have on here you want to have an explanation for it
you want to have a use for it and you want to have an example for it
for all three hundred questions right so what does that look like well

02:01
one of the questions is about css sprites so the way i would explain css
sprites using eu is i would say that css sprites are when you take a bunch of
images and you combine them into one image
the use for this is that you can limit the amount of requests that you are
making to a server because if you have all your images in one image
now you've turned it from multiple requests into a singular request which
can speed up some operations and an example of this would be amazon if you
go to amazon's website and you click on any of the assets that you see and you
try and pull up the image you will notice that the the logo the swoops the
anything that's an icon is actually just
one large image and they're only showing you a piece of it for each portion
of the ui so that would be my way of working through eu
where you would have an explanation about what it is you would say here's

02:02
how we would use it and you would have an example of it in action
all right and so you're going to work through that for all the questions we
have here and the idea here is if you do this for all the questions
especially if you do them on your own or like in a small team or on discord
together you really start to learn a lot of stuff
that we really haven't had a chance to cover in class so
not only are you feeling some gaps in the knowledge that we don't have time to
do together but you're also starting to talk more like an engineer you're
spending a sniffing portion of your day during anki talking about technical
stuff you're talking like an engineer you are
explaining things to other engineers and so by the time you get into a technical
interview is something you've been doing every single day you're comfortable
talking about these topics and you have bits of knowledge to reference so you're

02:03
never going to say no sorry i've never heard of it you're going to say oh well
that sounds similar to this thing and i know here's an explanation of that thing
here's how i've used it here's an example of how i've seen it before right
so you you go from saying sorry i don't know to at least getting in the right
ballpark with the things that we cover throughout this checklist so behavioral
questions with car help you get through that past that first sniff test these
eu's through the rest of these questions make it so that if your interview stops
at just technical questions where you're just engaging with an engineer you slam
dunk that interview right cool now last but not least is the technical
whiteboard um there's two different ways that this
happens um there is like legitimate whiteboarding

02:04
and there is answering of technical like there's there's like the coding
challenge right there's two flavors to this there is like where you're
physically answering a technical qual challenge on a whiteboard and there's
maybe like where you're given like a code wars and you're typing out the answer
whiteboarding um used to be more popular um but i love this gif right where
whiteboarding used to be more popular but nowadays if you're going to test
someone's like coding ability you should probably give them access to like their
tools and like how they would actually write code and so the actual
whiteboarding test has kind of faded a little bit it's still there i would
still say like 30 of my students get like on on whiteboard type tests um but
a lot of them are now kind of just like regular coding challenges similar to
your code code wars but there's something you have to understand
and that's that white boarding specifically and even your coding

02:05
challenges have nothing to do with just solving the challenge that is
something that's a goal but the actual act of whiteboarding the
actual act of solving these coding challenges there are some other things
that are just as equally as important as actually solving the problem
and the big thing here is your communication and collaboration skills
during the solve remember there's two things right there's two things that every
engineer is trying to figure out during these interviews right they're one
trying to figure out can you code and the other thing they're trying to
figure out is do i want to work with you for the next two years
i have had folks that have come into my whiteboarding interviews yes i still
whiteboard yes i'm a monster right that have come into my whiteboarding

02:06
interviews and they did this only on the pi square 5.21 [Music]
okay i think that's right yeah bro you're you're close but now we're good
we're good all right the the the white boarding tests more
than you getting the answer i want to see how you communicate
i want to see how you collaborate with other engineers right here's the thing
most interviewers will even help you most interviewers want to help you

02:07
i took a group of my previous students uh to google
uh i resume coders we have a partnership with google and i took my students to
google and we had their like the way google
does it is like you have interviews and then like your
your like interviews go to a committee we had the person that was like the
chair of that committee and the interviewers in the room and they both told us
that it is part of their mandate to give you a hint to give you a hint google
you're in an interview they want to give you a hint
but they can only give you those hints they can only give you that guide if
you're communicating and collaborating so this whiteboarding these coding
challenges is so much more than just solving the problem it's how you
communicate during this solving it's how you show how well you're going to work
with other engineers during your team on these problems and definitely when it's
a smaller team we're not talking like big companies when when the person

02:08
that's interviewing is probably the person you're gonna work with they're
really trying to see can i work with this person for the next two years can
they articulate when they're getting stuck can they can they can do they have
a clear thought process right and so the cool thing is we can learn to do this
we can learn to do this well right we can learn to 360 slam dunk
the the softer skills that are being tested during the white boarding process
and so i'm going to show you my my patented tips and tricks to get
part through this part of the interview that's not only going to help you solve
the challenge but it's also going to help you solve this communication and
collaboration phase of the technical interview as well now whiteboarding
tests so much more than like i said just the
the actual coding challenge it tests that communication collaboration it's a

02:09
good chance for the interviewer to ask specific job knowledge it shows me how
you think under pressure as much as that sucks uh it tests how well you
whiteboard whiteboarding is like an actual skill
like most people that go up to a whiteboard for the first time don't do
too well so we have to practice it uh it's also really post really worthwhile
to mention that this is like a highly debated topic right now uh at companies
a lot of companies no longer whiteboard because they don't like it
a lot of companies are even moving away from coding challenges in favor of
looking at your projects um asking you like technical questions right so
not every company you experience is going to do this but i need you to be
prepared remember we're opening as many doors as possible so if you do come
across one of these whiteboarding sessions if you do come across one of
these coding challenge sessions we're ready for it cool so let's talk about the
whiteboarding skills specifically and then we're going to talk about like
solving coding challenges um because if you're solving a coding challenge on the
whiteboard or if you're solving it like on a code wars code or pad type thing

02:10
it's the same skills let's just very quickly talk about whiteboarding in case
you encounter this and then we're gonna spend more time talking about how to
solve the coding challenge cool all right so if you actually
are one of the folks that have to go up to a whiteboard or or even if you are
solving a coding challenge when the interviewer is laying out the problem
please take notes on the side right please take notes of the question
that's being asked of you right and the reason why this is important
is because there's nothing more there's nothing worse
than getting 20 minutes into solving a problem only to go uh

02:11
what are we doing again what what what was cute can you tell me the
question one more time i'm sorry i know we've been doing this for 20 minutes can
you can you tell me tell me the question now me i never had a problem reviewing
the problem again but for some people this is like an immediate like we're
done right and so it's really good to take notes on the side very small
just high level stuff and typically i'll say to the interviewer oh thank you for
the question do you mind if i take notes as you relay the question please and
they'll say yes please feel free to take notes you give yourself a little slice
a little slice of the white board and you just do high-level stuff so you
remember the question all right they're asking for this this this and now you
have your notes so that even if you get deep into the problem you still remember
what's being asked of you and what to do especially exactly when you're under
stress white boarding can be stressful and so people that heard the question
understood the question 10 minutes in when things are getting a little more

02:12
intense we'll forget so make sure you take your notes
make sure you practice writing clearly uh if you have never written on a
whiteboard it is uh it is a a weird experience
if you have access to whiteboard i would try practicing on a whiteboard if you
don't have practice if you don't have a whiteboard to practice on i just use a
white piece of paper like a plain white sheet of paper and
practice writing out some of your code wars on that white sheet of paper
right because you're going to get used to like spacing you're going to get used
to like how much room your your handwriting takes up not everyone can be
blessed of having worked with the nuns like myself so make sure that you are
being mindful of how much space you take up when solving problems cool
the other part is be mindful of your of your actual space a lot of folks that

02:13
are new to whiteboarding they literally run out of space on the whiteboard so be
careful you can also if you are communicating
with your engineer that that's giving you the interview this is the golden
thing this is this is the big brain plays right here
you ready come in get in close big brain plays right here to save space
you can put a method on the whiteboard that says hey
this method does this complicated thing just to save some space i'm going to put
the method here i'm going to come back to it
right we'll fill it in a little bit i just want to this method does this but i
just want to save some space and i'll come back to it
think about what i just did i skipped over a complicated bit of the program
by saying i'm saving space and i'll come back to it
and then i get them going we're talking we're communicating we're collaborating

02:14
we're solving the problem time's up oops
we never got back to filling in that bit how about i follow up with it in an
email about how i would solve it and then i get i go to my car
i'm sitting in my car googling figuring out how i'd actually do it and then i
send them the fully realized code that's one of the beautiful things about
being on a whiteboard it's a game we can play it if we want to
right and so whenever i've gotten stuck on a whiteboard i've used it and it's
worked i would say 75 of the time that's worked but it's at
least worth a shot especially if you have no idea how to do it right
and so you just put hey we'll get back to this we run out the clock and then we
come back later right you're still solving the problem you're just saying
that this piece we're going to come back to later right so be mindful of the
space you're taking and practice whiteboarding is a skill
that you have to practice nobody shows up to an interview and is good at
whiteboarding if they've never done it right

02:15
and so make sure that you you actually practice this skill
on the off chance you actually have to do it like i said most interviews right
now remote a lot of them aren't really bringing you into the office like the
whiteboarding thing is kind of dying off a little bit anyway but it's worthwhile
i love whiteboarding the reason i love whiteboarding is because my code doesn't
have to run i can talk my way out of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and i'm good at doing it because i practiced it
so i love whiteboarding they they want to put me on the whiteboard i'll take a
whiteboard every single day because my code doesn't have to run
right so it's worth practicing in case it does show up now most of you right
most of you won't probably whiteboard probably about 30 of you will
uh but a lot of you will have coding challenges similar to things like your
code wars or elite code as we get further on right and so my

02:16
strategy for getting through technical coding challenges comes down
to one very important tool and that tool is called prep
just like we had car cause action result and eu explanation use example prep is
how we solve all of our coding challenges every
coding challenge you do from this night forward you must use prep
every code wars leak code interview every coding challenge you ever do
right for the rest of your life is prep and difference said leon's bad head
writing is also a hack you can't do text recognition if you can't recognize
exactly see it you figured it out bad handwriting is going to get me
through more interviews you got me it's been my strategy all along

02:17
all right prep parameters returns examples pseudocode
i've taught every single one of my students to do this for years and it helps
them get through the interviews if you are nervous going into code wars if
you're nervous going into coding interviews this will save you this is
how you get authentic communication and collaboration it's how you buy time to
solve a problem it makes you look like a phenomenal engineer and a lot of people
don't know how to do it so you are going to interview better than them cool
parameters returns example pseudocode what the heck does that mean all right
let's prep fizz buzz we're going to do fizz buzz together
and then we should have plenty of time for questions we're going to we're going
to prep through fizzbuzz and then we'll have plenty of time for questions

02:18
[Music] i just need a text editor let me just open this real quick
all right file new well new i'm going to save this as um
i'm going to save this as prep dot js cool all right so i just have like a
normal javascript file and we're gonna walk through prep
when you're first starting out right when you're first starting out i
recommend that you actually type out prep like prp at the top
once you are actually in interviews you we don't type out prep anymore
i see a lot of folks that like do it for a while
right that do it for a while and then uh when they're in an interview they're
still typing up prep we don't actually type it during the during the interview
but we do it while we're practicing just so we don't forget anything

02:19
av noob hey thank you for the hydration cheers to you all right
fizz buzz so we've we've touched on fizzbuzz during class
but fizzbuzz is a problem where i want you so i'm going to i'm going to
give you the problem that we're going to talk through prep i want you to
uh take in a number right and i want you to print
is i want you to print that from one to that number one two number
if the number is divisible by three i want you to print buzz if it is
divisible by five sorry i want you to print fizz
if the number is divisible by five i want you to print buzz and if the number
is divisible by three and five i want you to print fizz buzz
instead of the number so basically you're gonna you're gonna have a loop
and that loop is gonna print from one to a number

02:20
and at any point during that loop if the number is divisible by three instead of
printing that number we print fizz and then at any point if the number is
divisible by five we print buzz and at any point in time the numbers build by
three and five we print fizzbuzz instead of that number very very very common
interview question uh it comes up a lot during interviews i think we saw like i
saw like two or three people in chat that said they had a fizzbuzz problem
earlier today all right is it a bad look if you start googling
stuff in the middle of a technical whiteboard uh yes if you have not talked
to your interviewer about doing it yeah so typically when it before you go
like you want to make sure knowing going into an interview can i google remember
we talked about you need to talk to your interviewer before you show up and know
what's acceptable all right cool uh are people still asking this one hell yes

02:21
uh i've seen this question asked so far this year from my students
uh and last year i i lost count uh so here's what fizzbuzz was such a
popular problem that people stopped asking it
and then it came back with a vengeance because i was like wait a minute we're
going to actually keep asking it because if you can't solve fizzbuzz one you
don't know how to code and two you did not prep for this interview at all
so it still comes up there's definitely variations of it um there's like there's
ways to make it harder so yeah it definitely still comes up but
there are definitely variations to it as well all right so
parameters returns example pseudocode alrighty so my interviewer just
explained the problem to me and i'm gonna go say great do you mind if i just
take some quick notes uh about the problem that you just explained and
they're gonna say yes i'm gonna say all right wonderful so i have some i just
want to write down real quick to make sure i understand the problem uh you

02:22
said i'm gonna i'm going to print numbers or return numbers uh one to some
value called that we'll call the number that you're giving us
and then you're gonna you said that if the number
is divisible by three we do fizz and if the number is divisible by five
we do buzz and as the number is divisible by three and five we do
fizzbuzz instead of the number does that sound
similar to the question that you just asked me is that correct all right i'm
asking the interview is that correct right
and the interviewer's gonna go yes that sounds that sounds right uh you're gonna
give be given a number that number is going to go from one you're going to
print all the numbers from one to that number if the number is divisible by
three you do fizz instead if it's divisible by five you do buzz instead if
it's three and five you do fizz buzz instead so now we're on the same page i
understand the problem we've talked through it i am not ready to solve this
problem where most people mess up as they go great i know how to solve

02:23
fizzbuzz they get really excited they jump into the problem and
that's not what we're here to test folks remember
solving the problem is only one part of the problem we're also here to
demonstrate our communication and our collaboration
i have so many folks during interviews that get excited because they think they
know how to solve it and i can see that they're getting excited i'm like wait
you probably know how to solve this right
so if you know how to solve it you guys stay cool
calm collect it you can't show them that you're about the 360 slam dunk all over
their face right but i understand the problem all right thank
you for that problem i think i think i have a good handle on it i just have
some qual like some questions i would love to ask just to better understand
the problem before we actually jump into solving is that okay
sure that's great all right so you mentioned that i am going to
be given a number right and this is where the parameter starts remember
parameters are the things that are passed in to

02:24
your function that you're building all right so you mentioned that i am
taking in a number i have some questions about this number uh will this number
always be a number right will always be a number and you're
gonna say yes it'll always be a number wonderful so it'll never be a string a
boolean undefined another function i can assume that you're always gonna give me
a number yes it'll always be a number great so
i'm gonna say it's always gonna be a number now will this number ever be uh a
floated value okay have like decimal places or will always be a whole number
yes it'll always be a whole number great so it'll always be a whole number
i will never be a negative number you said 1 to the number so whatever be
negative no it'll never be negative all right so it'll be positive the whole
time uh so i understand i'm taking a number it'll be a whole number it'll
always be positive or it'll never be anything other than a number is there
any other kind of things that might be passed in that i haven't clarified here

02:25
in terms of it being number whole positive is there any other kind of like
gotchas that might that you think might come up here
no okay wonderful so i feel pretty comfortable knowing that i'm gonna be
taking in a number and i just want to clarify what i am
returning to you and so returning to you
you said you want me to return all these numbers is it okay if i like print them
to the console or do you actually want me to return these numbers as we're
going through oh i can print into the console wonderful so
i know that i'm not going to actually spit anything out of this array like i'm
not giving you i'm like sorry out of this function like i'm not going to give
you like an array of all the numbers uh i'm not going to give you anything other
than like console logging each number as we go along
so just to make sure you would like to see a console log of each number so if
this runs correctly we would see the number one get console logged and then
every number up until the number you gave me wonderful all right so i feel
comfortable knowing that we're taking in a number only a number that'll be a
whole number it'll be positive i feel comfortable knowing that we're going to

02:26
cons along all the values do you mind if i give you an example before we jump
into solving this problem sure all right so i'm just going to go
ahead and set up my function here and i'm going to call this function uh
fizz buzz you said it was fizz buzz right it was
fizz buzz not fizz biz fizz buzz right yeah fizzbuzz all right so i'm gonna
call this fizzbuzz fizzbuzz and uh i know that i'm taking in a
number so i'm just going to put my i'm just going to call my parameter num here
so now i'm taking in a number and then i'm just going to go ahead and set up
some test cases here so i'm going to i'm going to call fizzbuzz
and i'm gonna pass in the number five and i'm gonna pat i'm gonna call
fizzbuzz here and i'm gonna pass in the number three
and i'm gonna do one other one here buzz and it's going to be a bigger one sorry
we're going to do 15 here and so for this first one
since we're going to start off with the number one

02:27
uh one is good then we should see two and then the very first time we hit
divisible by three it should be fizz then four and then buzz because we hit five
does this look correct to you and and then that we should see in the
console the numbers one two fizz four and buzz cool
all right let's let's do this other one here three it should be a little quick
we do one two and then fizz right that looks correct
right because one and two are not divisible by three or five we finally
get to the first team divisible by three so instead of putting three we do fizz
beautiful and then we have this last one that's bigger down here i'm just going
to copy this real quick because we already did the first five numbers here
so no need to redo them so we'll do fizz and then the next one
will be the next one would be six so six is divisible by three so we should see
fizz then we'd have seven eight then we would have fizz again for nine

02:28
then we would have a buzz for ten then we would have 11 fizz for 12 13
14 and then this is the very first time that we have fizz buzz cool
does that look correct does this look correct in terms of kind
of what we're expecting to come out of this problem
right we we know that we're taking in a number
that number we've confirmed is a whole number it's positive we'll never have
anything other than a number we know that we are console logging each of
these values we've done some test cases does this all seem good cool
so at this point i have set up my test cases
for a very particular i've set up these test cases for two reasons right
there's two reasons why i set up my test cases why do you think i do test cases

02:29
what are your guesses why am i doing this
buy time it does buy you some time these test cases are definitely how you can
run out some of the clock here running up the clock is definitely
something fun that you can do we'll talk about why that could be
impactful if you're running out the clock they often can't give you a harder
question to follow up and as long as you've been communicating
with them the whole time it would be on them to say
hey we have a second part to this question that we need to get to right
and you kind of already asked them uh to clarify what the process would be right
so yeah we we can run the clock we need to uh it shows you your process and we
we actually know that we're doing the right thing right we understand that we
are doing what the interviewer is asking us
of i've had so many folks that have come
in and interviewed that have built out a wild solution that works only to not

02:30
actually solve the problem i asked of them right
that i have not asked of them right and so this really clarifies it and then
the other thing is i have my receipts i have my receipts if the interviewer
decides to change the question a half an hour into me solving the problem
i go whoa we ran these test cases you said this
was correct where did this where did where did
bob come from we did fizz buzz where did bop come from there was no bop here
you said fizz buzz where did bob come from right so you have your receipts
cool now this part of the process we're still not done
right we're still not done we've done the prep
we've done the parameters like the thing that's coming in the number we've done
the return what we're what we're what's coming out of the function we've done
our examples we still have our pseudo code
right so now i'm going to come back into my function and say all right um

02:31
since i know that we want to go from one to the number that's being passed in
that sounds like a loop to me uh so i'm gonna go ahead and do a loop
here i'm gonna loop just from one to that number
and then inside this loop i'm gonna check to see uh if the number's digital
by 3 5 or 3 and 5. and so i know to check to see that if it's divisible i'm
going to use some conditionals that are going to use a modulus i'm going to have
mod 3 i'm going to have mod 5 and i'm going to have mod 3 and 5.
and actually as i'm typing this out i'm noticing something interesting here
i'm noticing if i wanted to do like the number 15
and i did my modulus in this order uh 15 mod 3 would be true but i wouldn't
get fizzbuzz i would get fizz so i know that i have to do the three and the five
i think first let me just go ahead and do my my logic cube

02:32
i'm just gonna do my my mod three and five here
and so i think if i do that first i'm in a good spot
uh and then inside of each of these conditionals i am just going to go ahead
and console log the uh the the answer like i'm gonna
either console.log the number or the fizz buzz slash buzz cool
all right does this seem like a good direction to go about solving this problem
and they're going to say yeah at this point they would give me a hint
most interviewers want to give me a hint they might have said i i've told people
i have told people hey you're doing three and five you should

02:33
probably try three and five first can you tell me why can you tell me why
right i've given them that hint when i seen that their pseudo code was
incorrect so now i know what's coming into the problem i know
what's going out of the problem we have some examples that we've all agreed upon
and my pseudo code is at least in the right ballpark
all before i even attempt to solve the problem if you have a 45 minute interview
the first 15 minutes of your interview should be this
if you start actually trying to solve the problem within the first 15 minutes
you have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you have failed the communication and

02:34
collaboration part of the interview you might go down a wrong path
you might not have thought through an excellent solution i have had so many
engineers jump right into it and i didn't get to see the
communication i didn't see the collaboration i didn't get to
see how they thought through the problem
that's what i'm trying to figure out can you code and do i want to work with you
for the next two years do we work through problems in a similar way can
you take hints can you take instruction can we work together
and so prep is super super super important it's something
that you should do with every single code wars that you do going forward
every coding challenge you go forward you should do prep prep should be part
of your daily practice so that by the time you are actually ready to interview
you feel comfortable talking through all the parameters you feel comfortable
talking through all the returns you feel
comfortable working through examples you feel comfortable working through your

02:35
pseudocode you feel comfortable talking to your interviewer conveying your ideas
explaining your thought process letting your letting the problem marinate in
your brain so you can actually figure out how you're gonna solve it
this is the way folks my students that really invest in prep
right invest in prep they make it part of their daily practice they just do
phenomenally well in interviews way better than other engineers that don't
do this process that don't know how to communicate that don't know how to
collaborate that don't know how to think through their ideas and don't know how
to show it in a process that can be understood
so we've we've talked a lot tonight we've had a lot of little things to work
through i'm not even going to solve the problem

02:36
you you can go ahead and do we've always done fizzbuzz before this is this is
this is important right we've done the prep cool all right
i know we've covered a lot between tuesday and tonight
we've talked about how to open the doors on tuesday's class we talked about how
to get through the technical interviews in terms of car eu and prep it's a lot
to put on your plate lots of little things so i want to make sure we got
like 20 minutes left or so i want to answer answer some questions that i see
in chat and then we'll do a raid uh definitely stay for these questions i'm
sure there's a lot of things are going to come up that are really important to
discuss would you do all that even for fizzbuzz
yes even for a problem i know is super simple i still do prep
because it's not about solving the problem it's about the communication and
collaboration as well especially for problems that i think are
easy because if the problem's too easy i

02:37
know a follow-up question that is harder is probably coming after it
does the whiteboard have a standard size no a lot of tech companies just have
full on walls that are whiteboards what about virtual whiteboarding it's
not really too much of a thing i've seen
one or two companies that do it honestly
but you're more likely if you're doing a remote process to do a coding challenge
where you're working through a coding editor similar to like code wars
do you use prep for code wars yes every single code words you do should use prep
going forward can i get some endorsements nah i don't
actually add folks until they graduate i definitely don't endorse until you
graduate should we look up technical questions we
haven't gone through yet absolutely uh you can do exclamation point
the bank or execution point bank to get the technical questions

02:38
rufio does a great job of showing prep with code wars i agree rufios has done
streams working through code wars with a full
prep process definitely want to watch their past streams
can you give a tip if there's a question
where you have absolutely no idea how to answer you try to give something that's
at least close to what they're asking um so you you it'll be rare if you if
you do full banky and you've built out your project it'll
be rare that you don't at least have something that you can hinge on to a
question um and so i would i i literally would never say i don't know i would at
least say oh that actually kind of reminds me of where i think it's in the
same vein as this tell me if i'm wrong and i would give something at least
something and then they go actually that's not what i was thinking about
like oh okay that makes sense then right does a company hire remote for other

02:39
countries they can um but it's it's definitely harder to get
hired remotely especially if you're trying to like work for like a u.s
company remotely it's definitely it's definitely harder the thing i recommend
folks that are looking for remote opportunities is to look for companies
with a global hiring process we'll actually share a list later on
when we do the hit list together where i show you a list of 80 companies that
hire globally and we build out a hit list based on those companies so that's
actually we did that last cohort so you can actually find that video on youtube
where i built out a hit list specifically of companies that hire no
matter where you're located in the world what does bank stand for oh it's just a
bank of questions yeah a question bank on an acronym
do the behavioral questions need to relate to code or tech um
like the one about working on the pressure i have a lot of examples from
teaching but can't think of any from code no they do not have to be from code

02:40
or tech although ideally they come from coder tech as long as you have a story
about how your teaching has made you a better engineer then you are free to
answer questions using your teaching experience but that has to be part of
your story so that when you're answering those questions there's a connection
between what's being asked and what your answer is
what do you think of things like triple bite for the job hunt process uh
it's one one small door i don't put all my eggs in the basket
but you might wanna as well try it right doesn't hurt
you gotta think that you're you're going for 60 recommended applications if
triple bytes one of those sure why not should we remove the open to work filter
on linkedin is it helpful or harmful um we have to ask danny this one i i
we're gonna try and get danny to come on and talk us through like linkedin best
tips um i think it's okay um but i don't have any data to support it

02:41
it probably does help a little bit with like the algorithm in terms of
recruiters reaching out but i don't have any definitive data on yes or no if it
helps their harms but i will ask folks that i trust
can i still have access to all these videos on youtube and twitch for the
next one to two years i have no plans of taking down any of the videos yeah and
none of my content will ever be behind a paywall ever ever ever ever ever ever
ever ever a lot of people are interested in me but
after noticing i'm a sophomore in college they stopped considering me how
do i avoid this stop telling them that you are a sophomore in college
just don't mention it you're probably snitching on yourself because i
every single day i help folks get jobs that do not have a degree at all that

02:42
have never gone to college so you're probably snitching on yourself
uh do you have any advice on how to plan
out the prep uh it's up to you to figure out like what your time and your
schedule is but you need to like this like i always say you can't go into your
weeks like an accident you need to plan time for your prep in code wars you need
to plan time for your bank you need to plan time for updating your professional
list we will have some class time for this but you really do have to find that
time and that and that's why i said this
it's not i honestly don't feel like it's hard i just feel like it's a lot and
that's that's why that's what makes it hard as we go throughout this part of
the process i started reading about data structures
and algorithms and finding it really interesting is it too early for that
probably because there's so much stuff you have to focus in on right now that

02:43
we will get to data structures and algorithms we will cover them in really
approachable ways that make it so it's easier for you to solve your your actual
questions during technical challenges so i would hate for you to be focusing on
the wrong things miss that part and then not be at the place you need to be
i'm getting an associate's degree in cs this month how can i land an internship
for next summer um so the the college internship process is very cyclical um
it's not i mean are you going to continue your degree or
are you just looking for it because if you're not continuing your degree then i
wouldn't go for an internship i'd just go for a job and then all the advice and
how to get a job and how to get a job class applies yeah i don't recommend
internships unless they have a conversion the full time and they pay the same

02:44
hey that's great glad to hear it um hacker rank is very similar we mainly
use just code wars and leak code throughout program
what kind of project can we do if we are an uber driver food delivery driver uh
one of my students that actually went to amazon that was an uber driver they
built an app to compete with uber that was a delivery app that gave fair wages
to the drivers so i thought that was pretty cool
it's something that tied their past experience into their current experience
and it was good enough to get them a role at amazon
how are we turning in our freelance contract i'm just going to ask for it

02:45
like a normal document how far back do we want our github green squares to go
um at least throughout this year i was if i was trying to play the game
do companies cover the cost of moving to another country if they choose you
some companies do some companies don't do i need to add 100 devs on linkedin to
get added to the group no you do not as long as you just join and you have a
picture and like a filled out profile you get added to the group cool
if i come to your cohort with a background in game development would it
be wrong to have games i've made uh no absolutely not there'd be great things
to have in your portfolio when i say no games i mean like don't have like

02:46
tic-tac-toe or like like the normal cheesy games that bootcampers build
is machine learning part of tech do you have content on it we have a little bit
of machine learning content uh microsoft sponsored some of our streams last last
cohort uh and we used their open source machine well not sorry they we we used
their open machine learning tools uh to um build out some cool stuff
they have some wonderful like machine learning apis that we used
do you think 100 is going to get so big that recruiters know it's a boot camp
probably and then they're gonna know that we have
amazing candidates that they're gonna want to hire
they seek us out that's the long-term goal
you mean we should backdate our pushes all the way to january i mean

02:47
it's up to you if you have any advice on becoming a mentor
i would like to work with the new developers outside of work just support people
we got so many people on discord that could use your support just do it that's
it that's all i need to do you'll get better at it over time
make sure that when you when you uh seek to help that you also seek to learn
it's now a good time to hone in on banky daily code wars getting all the
checklist items completed um yes you should start like tonight
like we're gonna end a little early take some of that time to plan out what your
week's going to look like what the month's going to look like and then get to it
i had a coffee chatter throw a bit of shade saying we're an agency yeah it's
called a gatekeeper you're going to run into those folks
that's why we that's why we have so many folks that we're reaching out to not

02:48
just one or two some people are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they can't help it
how many people have you seen go through us that are above 40. we have a pretty
decent number of folks that are above 40. hundreds uh cool

of the secrets here to to to to learning how to get through this
