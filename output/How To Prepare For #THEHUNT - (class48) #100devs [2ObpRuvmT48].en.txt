welcome back good to see you all love to see you in chat hey what's going on
everybody Emma B how you been what's going on everybody we online let's go
super excited for tonight uh this is one of my oh this this is like this is the
point right like everything that we've been working towards leads up to what we
start tonight right all the hard work all the late nights all the homework the

00:01
networking the the the coding the finger pain the wrist pain the eye pain the
neck pain the everything is for what we start tonight
so tonight we are laying out the hunt all right we are laying out the hunt
what do our what does the end of our August our September are hunt Tober
look like so that we can get these jobs that's what I'm talking about that's
what I'm talking about let's go so tonight uh will be a shorter class
hashtag End early as always and uh we are going to lay out kind of what to
expect uh what you need to be working on a lot of folks are Leon we're getting
towards the end of program what should be my priorities be what should I be

00:02
focusing on day to day what should I be building what should I be working on
we're going to answer that tonight and then we're gonna set the expectation for
the next two months let's go today I was able to say I have a lecture
on a software architecture Paradigm when someone asked do you really know coding
let's go let's go you did those MVC lectures I see y'all let's go
are you really in here like trying to spam your like bot service like what
that's weird get out of here what's going on that's wild I love that see look
that's why we do what we do when someone asks you are you a software
engineer not only am I a software engineer I make lectures on software

00:03
engineering do you wanna do you want to see my MVC lecture
do you want to see my MVC lecture come on now am I a software engineer get out
of here I'm you don't I bet how long you been how long you've been a software
engine I bet you don't have a lecture where's your lecture at who you taught
I honestly you teach nobody I've been teaching the whole Community I'm
Community taught by the way get out of here [Laughter]
I bet they'd never taught another person exactly mine exactly
I taught my cat MVC let's go let's go let's go I'm proud of y'all
that that was a lot of work and some of you are really ran with that homework
some of you built some really cool lectures I've been seeing them come in

00:04
[Music] share that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] put that stuff on your
portfolio put that on your GitHub right when when somebody's looking at
your portfolio and they see that you've built a whole
lecture on MVC what's going through in their brain let's stop and think for a
second when somebody's when somebody comes to your portfolio when they come
to your your GitHub or whatever they're interacting with you
and they see that you've put together lectures on topics
they know their stuff they know what they're doing they're teaching they know
so much they're teaching other people we're doing this stuff for a reason
folks we need to pass that sniff test if we're gonna do
well on the hunt right we need to do these little things that when somebody

00:05
comes and they look when they when they give you those six seconds
right when they give you those six seconds
right and they look and they go hmm this question pushes code every day hmm this
person has built lectures on software engineering principles paradigms hmm
this person has a really solid projects this person has real clients hmm are you
going to the next round like are are you passing that first like
are you getting past that first bar right absolutely yes
100 yes no recruiter no recruiter ever got in trouble
passing the person that pushes code to GitHub every day that has solid projects
that has built lectures on software engineering principles they have never

00:06
gotten in trouble for pushing that person to the next round
we're setting up a little little little sprinkles here right we're opening
little doors right that are going to enable us to have opportunity come our
way and what you have to realize is that a lot
of these interviews it's a numbers game but it's a it's an Impressions game
people are people at the end of the day and you can play the game and today I'm
going to show you how to play the game then you have a choice to make is that
the game you want to play so let's get into it as always I always
like to start off uh with some some lovely questions uh tonight we're
walking through some hundred Dev stuff we're talking about hunttober we're
bringing back the idea that you need to be done some stuff your professional
checklist your Hit List your interview prep your 100 project a lot of stuff to

00:07
talk about tonight but as always let's start off with some
questions you got questions maybe I got some answers
thank you everybody for the for the primes primes just lit up today that's
wild thank everybody and all those Bezos bucks
People Are People yeah uh People Are People we're playing a game where we're
we're we're realizing that we are we are playing a game where there are people
that are looking at this stuff I was told I was good at interviewing by
CTO and all I did was regurgitate my answers from the interview questions
Banky let's go let's go Banky hey NW Smith thank you for the gifted

00:08
Subs that's wild thank you so much appreciate it
thank you for the win I love that foreign list of companies that internationally
hire not only have we shared that list I have a whole lecture
where I found companies that hire globally and I found people that worked
at those companies and I showed you the messages I would actually send them and
we're going to do it again so as we get deeper into the hunt uh I know
that there are kind of two types of folks well there's technically three
types of folks right so we have folks that are going to be applying locally
which has a slightly different strategy than folks that are applying globally

00:09
right and then there are folks that are want to be remote only right and so
each of them has like a slightly different process and as we get deeper
into the hunt we're gonna have specialized material for each of those
processes so if you know you want to stay local we're going to do a version
of me building out the hit list for local companies we're going to do a
version of me building out the hit list for folks that want to be hired globally
and then folks that are kind of going for a remote only type opportunities yeah
is it too late to join this Hunt No join us make sure you uh you do exclamation
point 100 devs to learn about the what we've been going on what we've been
doing and then make sure you join our Discord we have a catch-up crew we have

00:10
new people joining us every day cool alrighty so
we have some good questions I think we got most folks in here I think we're good
was there a raffle today I don't know did you open the newsletter did you check
did you check that's the point yeah if you're new around here we have a
lot of I can see a lot of first-time chatter it seems like a lot of folks
that are kind of new today uh do exclamation point 100 devs that'll tell
you everything about what we've been doing what we've been working on and
then you can join our Discord and join our ketchup crew uh we have tons of
folks joining the program every single day uh our Discord is 38 000 plus strong
uh you can get all your questions answered uh we have an amazing amazing
community of folks we are Community taught we're not self-taught around here
we're Community taught around here cool all right folks let's get into it thank
you for being here if you haven't already go ahead and

00:11
check in for me please exclamation point check in I'll give you the link for
today uh the checking in is twofold one it lets me know that you're here and it
lets other folks find us uh we're gonna be talking about tonight how important
checking in is as we get into post program we need to know that you were
here how can we verify that you did the program if we didn't know that you were
here for the program so checking in is important please go ahead and make sure
you do that remember if you type in exclamation point checking it doesn't
actually check you in you have to go to the Tweet you have to like you have to
retweet it cool I want your homework your MVC lectures
were due today please go ahead and submit them uh some folks were saying
Leah and I did like a keynote or something drop it on a Google Drive and
share the Google drive with me if you didn't use like a Google doc or
something that's immediately shareable go ahead and just put it in like a drive

00:12
and share that with me so no stress if it's like a physical
file or just like a PDF host a PDF somewhere yeah cool
I want to see him we got a lot of them already came through uh we had 300 of
them before we even went live for class tonight which is pretty cool to see
um so yeah please get that homework in get the MVC in I was due today would
love to see them I've been taking a peek through them some of y'all are funny
some of y'all got jokes that's all I'm gonna say
what if it's terrible yeah we ain't got grades here nobody's great in this stuff
it's it's it's binary did you do it or did you didn't quality is up to you
laughs alrighty not this Sunday but next Sunday is an

00:13
important day September 4th we are doing our back end review we have one major
topic left to add to our back end which is our authentication which we start on
Thursday then next week we will be continuing authentication and doing a
team project building a full stack web application once we've had a chance to
add authentication we've had a chance to
build a project together as a team we're going to do a back end review so from
we're going to go all the way back to the beginning
all the way back to the beginnings of node all the way back to the things
we're talking about I don't know promises callbacks all that fun stuff
and work our way all the way up to building full stack web applications
together so how long we're streaming that'll be no
idea uh but that's what we'll be doing so book off your calendars especially if
you're new especially if you still have some review that you would like to do

00:14
you're part of the ketchup crew this will all be perfect for you so not this
Sunday but the following cool next week we will be doing team projects
uh you're a baddie uh 007 thank you so much for the gifted Subs
I appreciate that thank you thank you for telling me I'm a baddie every once
in a while you didn't know that you're a baddie right
I'm a baddie and I write bad code I love it uh next week uh we will be doing our
team project if you would like to participate in the team Projects please
fill out this form yes you right now that is watching this stream if you
would like to participate in our uh in our
in our team projects uh please go ahead and I fill out this form okay what we're

00:15
going to do is we're going to put groups together uh from that form and so next
week you'll have your group from if you filled out the form yeah
I've been having issues writing bad code
I'm starting to get kind of okay code oh no that's great
can we participate if we're still a beginner absolutely that's a common
question people say like Leon during these like during these team projects right
um during these team projects um during these team projects I I don't
feel like I can contribute cap that's a lie you always kind of something
contribute you could be the person writing the HTML you could be the person
writing the CSS you could be the person writing the documentation you could be
the person grabbing the copy you could be the person that trusts a little bit
in themselves and pushes to maybe do something a little bit more than they
feel comfortable with right there's always something to do in these team

00:16
projects and we are Community taught the point of the projects is not to be
flashy and show out and and try and bring in stuff that we haven't learned
yet leave all that off to the side I don't want you doing react in these team
projects or any other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we
haven't learned we're gonna take the things that we have learned in class and
use that to build and if you've been here in class you know how these pieces
come together you know how these things can be shaped and bent and broken and
that's what we're gonna do together cool
can we also pick our own team members no I want you at new people with fresh
Minds coming together uh to to work on a project because we're going to be doing
this quite a bit we're going to have quite a few team projects and one of the
things that you want right one of the things that you want
is that you want the ability to have more peers that you know that you can

00:17
start to to get to know a little bit better right
part of what you'll probably be looking for is some peer references going
forward right you're going to want to be able to say like hey I worked with this
person I know how well they they work in a team I know that they're a good coder
right you want to start being exposed to a few more folks in the 100 devs
Community because eventually peer peer references are a thing right and so you
want to make sure that you're you're kind of mixing a little bit yep foreign
the hardest thing about team projects you don't know if you're going to end it
with people significantly smarter stop I that that's one of the things that
gets my goat people are not significantly starred or smarter right
there are some folks that have the privilege of more time that have had a
little bit of chance to work on this more and there are some people that just

00:18
walk in with Brazen confidence and no idea what the hell they're doing right
and so what you want to be able to do here right is there's a lot of like people
that are getting bannivated I don't know what's going on but a lot
of people are getting banned immediately coming from somewhere
um if you're spamming something over and over again I'm just gonna ban you but
you're also getting bandivated yeah hair band
cool all right I like my whole thing just like lit up with people like I
think maybe somebody rated us from somewhere but they all just got banned
that's weird so there's something on Twitch now which
is like if you've been banned before and you create like a new account
um it like automatically filters out your your stuff like I don't know if it
shows you that you that you put a message um but yeah like it just knows that

00:19
you're like bandivating that like you were banned before and like now it knows
that you're being banned again it actually doesn't know if it lets you
know that you post it maybe that's why there is people spamming but yeah it
just blocks all of them which is weird yeah
I haven't seen that yet I'll look into that after
um after streaming cases being a little weird
but yeah so one of my things is that a lot of folks stop themselves for from
participating in team projects because they have this idea that they don't know
enough or that they can't be helpful on a project guess what you're going to be
doing in two months you are going to be joining a team full of developers that
already know the entire code base that already know way more than you already
know and guess what you still have to be able to do provide value

00:20
you still have to be able to provide value you every single person here is
about to join a company where they are the person that knows the lease because
they just joined and when you join right when you join
you are going to have to figure out how to provide value on that job
so when you join a team of your peers you can't have that mentality
you can't have that mentality it's something you have to practice now right
it's something you have to practice now it's something you have to get good at
now the reason why we do these team projects is that by the time you're
joining the company you've battled your demons already
right you've battled those demons already so you gotta show up to these

00:21
team projects knowing that if you've been here you have a means of being
helpful you have a means of writing bad code because we're all baddies still and
if you wind up on a team that has someone that's a little bit further
along on the roller coaster we're all on the same freaking roller coaster maybe
there are a few seats ahead you need to advocate for yourself and say hey I feel
like you're a little further ahead on the roller coaster but this is still a
team project how can I be supportive what can we do together to build this
project you have to start advocating and
communicating for yourself in these team environments and that's why we practice
it and we're going to practice it a couple of times because it is
hard it is something that people struggle with it is something that
causes people anxiety right right but it's the thing you're all

00:22
going to be doing very very soon so we're all on the same roller coaster
some of us are a few seats ahead some of us are a few seats behind in these team
projects figure out a way to show up to contribute and to be helpful and if you
are the person that's a little ahead well guess what it's your turn to help
folks and get them to where you are at on the roller coaster we're going down
the ride and we're trying to reach back and grab a few folks with us
Leon am I tall enough to ride this ride you absolutely are
this is something that um comes up I actually have a slide for it
we're gonna we're gonna skip past this wonderful stuff and I'm gonna go right
here there are two points in the learning to code Journey that are the toughest

00:23
or let's say where most people exit the roller coaster okay there are two spots
the first spot is day one day one everyone's like whoo money great
job happy career high growth uh sign me up right like that's what I
want I'm will not Leon I'll do the hard work I'll do the hard work I'll show up
I'll do the I'll do everything like I I want them I want and then next class
you wanted me to do all of that you were
serious you seriously wanted me to to to learn and to do this stuff you you like
there I gotta I gotta I gotta take I gotta take time out of my day to learn
like I can't just like press a button and now I'm making six figures like what

00:24
class three gone gone that's Shay Hal that Shay house has destroyed more more
careers because people realize the work they're gonna have to put in right
I love that reading but it it it it filters some folks right
that that that first three classes is the signing up for the gym
right the first three classes is a signing up for the gym it's it's
December we're oh man we're gonna we're gonna be we're gonna be looking good
we're gonna be pumped we're gonna be we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
we're gonna be oh we're gonna be looking good
January rolls around you're day one in the gym yeah let's go I'm on the

00:25
treadmill and then two weeks later how do I cancel this membership you're
you're sending letters to some weird corporate office and and who knows where
and uh yeah right so I've been in this game for 10 years
teaching boot camps for 10 years those first two classes are people kicking the
tires that third class is when it sinks in that holy crap I'm gonna have to do
real work and they're gone that's the first place we lose people
you've made it all this way you should be immensely proud of putting
in that work that time that muscle to build up the skills that you have how
dare you go to a team project sit down at a table with your peers and say that

00:26
you don't have something to contribute how dare you
you've shown up you've put in the work you've consistently shown
that you have what it takes when so many folks do not
so I don't care if no doesn't a hundred percent click I don't care if you still
struggle with some CSS it doesn't matter you're still in the game
and so the second part where I lose the most people is today
this is where this is where mentally a lot of people check out
because this is when it starts to get real right is when it starts to get real
and instead of facing the rejection instead of facing some of the hard work

00:27
that's about to happen right they take themselves out the game
there's nothing worse then taking yourself out the game
we've had people I have put the exact I have put the exact words people have
shared on the screen that said I have coded a button and got an 83 000 a year
job out of that interview I have put on the screen people that
have had no technical interviews and have gotten six-figure jobs
not me not me telling you me literally showing you you can go look in the
celebrations Channel and see 50 other people that have been pinned and then

00:28
people that have been popping off recently that have gotten the job
I don't care where you are if you do the
things we talk about tonight you can get a job
it's going to be a lot it is a lot of work to pass that sniff test to get past
the Gatekeepers takes a certain mindset and for a lot of folks they take
themselves out of the game right before they score the touchdown right before
they win right right before all the things that
you've been showing up for months are about to culminate and happen for you
they say you know what maybe I don't know enough
maybe I I haven't done enough homework maybe I maybe I forgot to submit a few
things maybe maybe I when I sit in these team projects it seems like they know

00:29
more than me so that maybe means I don't know something
these things they start to say in their brain right
start to say in their brain to slowly convince themselves to take them out
take themselves out the game they'd rather be taken out the game
then put in two more months of work and a whole host of rejection
I know rejection's tough I know it's hard I know that it it it it sucks to
get those first five ten rejections in a
row right because our our Spirits get so high when these recruiters Reach Out
and it doesn't work out okay all right but don't ever take yourself out the
game always let somebody else take you out like the I you want to be drag

00:30
Kicking and Screaming away from this career right like that's that's what
that's what the mindset is you need to be you you you I'm gonna keep showing
off these interviews I don't care I'm Gonna Keep some in code
I'm going to keep doing these projects I'm going to keep doing this and you're
gonna have to drag me away from this career that's it it's a decision
I have had students of all walk shapes sizes Creed colors it doesn't matter
I have never seen a singular thing that has helped
somebody get a job over somebody else other than their willingness and their
ability to want that job that's it there is always a way always always a way
now are you going to have to apply remember when we say apply we don't mean

00:31
click apply to 60 different jobs yes are you gonna have to do a lot of work
each day yes are you gonna have to do the work that
most folks don't want to do yes but there is a way
so please for the love of everything you have inside of you don't take yourself
out the game you've put in too much time too much work too much effort
to get in your brain and say you can't do this because you can people have
literally gotten jobs that cannot code I have known people that cannot code

00:32
themselves out of a brown paper bag that have gotten phenomenal jobs
how'd they do it I'm about to show you tonight I'm about to show you
I've showed you already I've shown you somebody that coded a button
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] button and got a job I've shown you somebody that did Fizz
buzz and got a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] job so how dare you say to yourself you're
not ready to get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] job out there how dare
how dare you that you're not ready how dare you say you're not good enough

00:33
how dare you say you're not ready how dare you say you're not gonna put in the
work after putting in all this work to get here nah
it's a decision and I need you to make that decision tonight
I ain't here to play I'm here to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around no more it's a decision
either want it or you don't that's it cool all right we got some other things
we got to go through real quick and then we'll get back into this
so team projects next week you all better be there no I
don't feel comfortable no I don't I don't know how to do the now get out of
here you all have something that you can contribute you all have some value that

00:34
you can bring you all have the ability to do amazing work you've been here
you have the templates you have the receipts you're going to show up you're
going to put in work you're going to build something awesome cool
uh we got some jobs to celebrate uh we we there's too many and I know that
sounds like it sounds like you know like
it's a flex but there really is too many uh so I'm just picking some ones that
that I think were were great um but there's plenty more in the celebrations
Channel there's way more on Twitter I'm gonna keep trying to highlight a few
each class um but there really are just a lot of
folks getting jobs which is which is pretty cool because we're not even
supposed to be there yet we're not supposed to be here yet and folks are
already bringing it through so uh let's let's go through the path that they've
gone through uh got the job I start my first role as a software developer next
month thank you Leon and Hunter devs community community taught folks uh for
a truly like changing experience an opportunity I can't believe it 100 jobs

00:35
you got this it's possible they got the job through networking folks
uh during the summer I took the opportunity to become a software
developer intern today every season offer letter and got promoted to a
software developer one thanks Leon Hunter devs for the amazing support
let's go get we don't get got we go get community taught folks they're not
saying Leon they're saying 100 devs 100 devs Community taught
next week we're doing community projects pull people along with you
pull people along with you if you wind up in the group and you feel like you're
the person that knows the most guess what your job is your job is to not
build the best software it's the it's your job to make sure everyone else can
we get that next week's team projects if you find yourself to be the person
that's sitting a few seats ahead in the roller coaster your job is not to be a
flexasaurus your job is to not try and
grab some weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you learned on

00:36
a weekend by yourself it's to turn to the other five people in that they're in
that group with you and say how do I get you a few seats ahead on that roller
coaster that's it that's the point
you can't do that get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out I don't want you here
God there's too many of you here this is gonna be a lot lots on my plate you
can't be a good team member you're not committing to a community talk get the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out bye it's been nice thank you bye all right
uh after being contacted by an inside recruiter and going through my first
interview ever I got the job as a software engineer I'm so happy I can't
believe it because I totally feel like I could never get a job like that
how many of you are feeling that right now because I totally felt like I could

00:37
never get a job like that felt it was out of my reach
I'll be making more than my father is making and he worked at a company for
10 plus years my first real job I'm 18 years old I'm a software engineer
let's go sure I got your shirt I'll send it to you later today let's go
totally felt like I could never get a job like that felt like it was out of my
reach let's go there's a window open folks
there's a window opening you're so close to going through it don't take yourself
out the game go through the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
window please please just go through the window
any doubt that pops up in your head shove it down now's not the time
it's game time it's the hunt no time no room for that doubt
I showed you the trough of Sorrows the first thing I showed you you're in The

00:38
Wiggles of false hope it's the lowest point on the trough of Sorrow
I'm a man I didn't put the slide on the screen the lowest point is right now
I showed you that day one day one day one day one lowest point is right now
I showed it to you day one most people like when I show them like
yeah all right Leon well you went through it and now's the hardest part
The Wiggles of false hope right The Wiggles of fossil this is where
we're at right now you put in the work you've been showing
up you've been doing the things you're supposed to do and now it gets real
because we have to transition from classroom to on the job and all the
alarm Bells go off in her head nobody's gonna pay me to do this I don't feel
like I can do this nobody nobody's gonna ever uh think I'm a real engineer all
these things come to our brain that's the thing I showed you day one

00:39
it's the lowest point but we're gonna start building projects
together you're gonna start building your 100 hours project we're going to do
hunt Tober together where we do a data structure and algorithm question every
single day together and slowly those Wiggles of false hope
get you to the promised land but you're in the lowest part and I
showed it to you day one cool so I love that everyone
I showed you tonight and I've been showing you from these jobs we were
getting are thanking the community we are Community taught
there are so many of us like it's it's not me right like yeah like I show up we
do class like fun yeah but I'm not the person answering all the questions on
Discord I'm not the person answering all
the questions in chat I'm not the stream team that that's that has another whole
crew of folks that are coming to help and support right like it's a community
we built something special and now's the time that we need to lean

00:40
on it the most I say that one more time we built something special and now is
the time we need to lean on it the most we know that this should be the low
point we know this is The Wiggles of false hope be on Discord help each other
answer questions look at each other's resumes look at each other's stuff help
each other takes nothing from you to help another hundred ever
all right don't take yourself out the game right
I don't know what it is about this point in programming doing it for 10 years
this is where folks decide you know what I'm not going to be successful so I'll
stop [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that get rejected 60 times

00:41
who cares what's the difference what's the difference what's the difference
stopping now or getting rejected 60 times and then stopping who cares
don't reject yourself exactly you got this you got this
you wind up in the same place if you take yourself out and you were to get
rejected 60 times you wind up in the exact same place but guess what happens
that doesn't happen you learn from each rejection you learn from each little
failure in an interview you learn how to be a lean mean interviewing machine and

00:42
you come out of it with a job why stop you have the skills you have the things
and I'm gonna show you tonight if you even if you never showed up for a class
before and this is your first class I'm going to show you what to do and you
would get a job that's it you do the things we talk about tonight
you'd get a job even if you're a ketchup crew even it's your first class
you do these things you'd get a job what we're about to show is a lot
and the next two months and the end of August are unequivocally an exercise in

00:43
time management an exercise in time management you will have a lot to do
lots of doors to open and I need you to go hard for two months
figuring out your schedule not going into your days like an
accident not going into your weeks like an accident not going into your mumps
like an accident you must plan you must organize you must have tough
conversations with your family and friends your friends as Dr Akama says
your friends call tell them they called
at the wrong time you got some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do for the next two months
some of you are going to talk to your family hey these Tech these next two
months I've been working really hard over these past few but these next two
they're going to be tough I'm gonna need some more time can you help me out
some of you have to delete tick tock exactly so I'm gonna have to delete tick

00:44
tock [Music] it's gonna be an exercise in time management but you go hard
for September and October and I guarantee you you will be
surprised in yourself how far along in your journey you will be and how close
to a job you will be so with that being said let's talk about hunttober
we're building up the hunt over October is a daily event we meet every day we do
a data structures and algorithms together on Discord I answer questions
from the crowd about the things that they're experiencing on the job we're
going to be looking at resumes portfolios how to do job Outreach we'll
be talking about interview practicing and skills we'll be doing verifications

00:45
for folks that start getting jobs it's going to be a special time
last cohort we did Mega month and it was
really really helpful for a lot of folks they went from really not being so much
interview ready to really interview ready because every day we built up to
more and more complex data structures more and more complex ways to interview
you were prepping for a whole month in terms of like talking through coding
challenges making sure all your stuff is buttoned up
but hunt Tober is not for everyone hunt Tober is for folks that are ready
to get a job you say it again October is for folks
that are ready to get a job and what does that mean that means that it is for

00:46
folks that are ready at this point in time to do the things they need to do to
be job ready I went to laser focus my attention on
folks that are ready to get a job okay that means that this will not be public
streams this will not be like on Twitch this will be in a private channel on
Discord uh this will be in a private voice call on Discord
um this is something that we're going to be focused you're gonna have special
channels where you can share your the things that you're working on you can
share the things that you need feedback on it will be a community of folks laser

00:47
focused on getting a job and supporting folks to get that job
and I ain't here to play not here to play at all
I'm gonna be putting a lot of time a lot of energy into October
hundreds of hours why did I always do this hundreds of hours
hundreds of hours uh into October lots of work on my end the mods and the
communities and and I'm not here to play so if this is something that you want
if this is something that you want to be
a part of if you're ready to get the job well then I got a list of stuff I need
you to do to be part of hunttober to get access to

00:48
that part of Discord to make sure that you're in that mode where you're willing
to grind there's some things you need to
do now if you're like Leon I'm not ready for that
I'm not ready for hunt Tober I'm kind of still going at my own pace that's okay
there will still be a path for you like there like this is just something
special for folks that are that have been culminating in this in this program
so far and that are ready to get the job it's a moment of focus it's a moment of
attention it's a moment of really making sure folks are ready for the job
now if you're not ready for the job that's okay still continue at your own
pace we'll be building systems for you as well right but October is about
getting a job so here are the things I need done
first if you want to participate in October I need you to type I want it in
chat I want to make sure that people actually want this before we commit so
much time and energy to it okay all right I think I think we're there

00:49
I see a lot I want it all right sounds good to me
all right I want it now I'm gonna hold you to it if you typed I want it I'm
gonna hold you to it I really really want it I'm gonna definitely hold you to it
people are highlighting the message I want it let's go all right all right all
right this this might not have been uh this might have been worth it let's go
that's why I show up folks I want you all to get jobs and this is the best
thing I could ever see right this to me means that the past months of time
right the past most of the time were worth it and we have a strong community
of folks that want to be focused that want to get jobs and that are going to
support each other in that Journey when you type I want it it's not just
for you we are Community taught that means you're committing to a month of

00:50
focus to help everyone get across that finish line let's go all right
I need to be checking in for every class uh going forward every single class
matters right we're going to be doing authentication we're gonna be doing
react and we're going to be doing classes specifically tailored to the hunt
right so if you missed one of these classes it's going to impact you during
hunttober right so I need you to be here for each class I need you to check in I
need you to be submitting everything meaning that I need you to be doing the
homework homework is always going to be due a week later the homework now like
actually really matters right if you don't do the homework now you'll
be hey thank you for the gift of subs thank you for being here
look at look at some of these photos look at some of these these ogs in chat
too DM boy how you doing uh I need to be checking in for each class

00:51
that means you're liking retweeting the Tweet so I know that you're here
uh you're doing the homework meaning that you're actually submitting the
homework you had an MVC lecture to submit get it in
get the lecture in I'll give you until Thursday
get it and placed you had the whole week I'm gonna give it to Thursday get it in
whoopsie you said you wanted it here's what I'm going to actually do so you'd be
checking it so I know that you're here you're doing the homework uh there's
gonna be mainly project building that you're doing and so I'm going to be
asking you to do the team projects to be doing the homework
right and the reason why the homework is important now is because it really is
setting yourself up for all the things we need during the hunt
right the MVC lecture people like when I when I signed it I didn't really
tell you why right A lot of people like oh Leon wants us to build a lecture huh

00:52
that's cool but now you see the logic right having a lecture on your portfolio
automatically makes you an expert right we're big brain in it when
somebody is taking those six seconds to look at your portfolio and they see that
you build lectures on stuff come on now that they're gonna think
about you differently right they're going to think about you differently so
all these things right all these things are just setting you up right to to to
pass that sniff test so you can get the job right and so the homework's really
important going forward it's really important going forward all right networking
I need you to bring it back uh each week I need you to be getting

00:53
one coffee chat and three connections every week uh as we
as we get closer to hunt Tober we are going to focus our networking and
you could start this now networking doesn't have to be General networking
anymore what we will be doing is our networking
will become focused meaning that we're not just going to random meetups we're
not just going to random twitters what we are doing is we are building out
where's our hit list sorry I'll get to it a second we are building out our hit
list right exclamation point sheet we do exclamation point sheet and chat it
gives you the link to our hit list so go into exclamation point sheet there
we go hold on I'm trying to grab I'm trying to grab the link

00:54
there we go copy link uh so there's something really uh cute today
uh somebody before class did uh exclamation point sheet and then
nightbot gave them the sheet and um they thanked knightbot for giving them the
sheet which I thought was uh pretty cool I think they said thank you to nightbot
I was like that's precious all right here's the sheet you all have
been doing this part of the sheet right you've been doing like oh I've been
going to these events been putting stuff in but boom there's this other part of
the sheet right it's not going to load right now because there's like a
thousand plus of you trying to load it right now but uh there's a place to put
the company the date you added it the open roll right the open roll you are
going to find 60 companies that have an open role

00:55
right 60 companies that are going to find right
that are going to find that have open rules where you can apply right
and you're going to add them to the sheet
so 60 companies that are hiring that it seems like a role where you could be a
good fit you're going to add them to your hit list
then your networking becomes targeted you are going to find Folks at those
companies to start networking with we're gonna have whole classes on this
whole classes on how to network how to find these people but that's something
you can start right now find the companies find the people that work at
those companies and that's your networking you're going to start trying

00:56
to get coffee chats with them you're gonna start trying to connect with them
so that when you are ready for hunt Tober and you are ready to apply
you're getting referrals and not clicking apply so I need you to start
this week this week I expect one coffee chat
next week I expect one coffee chat and three connections
it could be General but you maybe also want to start getting focused
60 companies with 60 rolls yeah yep we've had full classes on how do you get
coffee chats you can watch some of our earlier how to network we have a whole
class on how to network right so if you're like what's a coffee
chat go back and watch your how to network class

00:57
right this is often like I said the hardest part for folks we're going to
have classes on how to find people that work at these companies so we can well
we're gonna get there so you can do general purpose networking if you want
until we get there but if you want to peek ahead I have a few classes on my
YouTube about how to build Out The Hit List how to get a job how to find these
folks I literally did it for three hours
straight building out someone's Hit List finding the companies finding the open
rules finding the company the people that work at that company you want to
take a peek you can go take a peek at those but I'm going to expect you to be
networking cool I need to be pushing every day need to be pushing every day
you should be doing a coding challenge every day already

00:58
these are things that I uh these are these are not these are not
new things that I've been asking you to do I've been asking to do these things
for a while so it shouldn't be like oh Leon oh my gosh what are these what are
these things you're asking me to do now I've been asked you to do these things
for a while all right so you're bringing back the networking
I want you to push every day recruiters love those green squares they
do they do they do but more so it's getting you in the habit of writing code
every day that by the time we're in Hunt October
you're a lean mean writing code machine ideally you're doing your coding
Challenge and pushing that to GitHub right but if you're not ready for that
that's okay push a readme file I don't give a crap push a readme file every day
for the next week for all I care and eventually you'll start pushing real code
cool uh we have some other stuff that I want
us to do but we're going to take a break here I know like holy on expectations

00:59
things to do oh boy so we're gonna take a break we're at the top of the hour if
you're new around here we'd like to be healthy we like to uh make sure that if
you're able that you get out move around
walk around hydrate uh and then we'll be back I'm gonna talk through some of the
other things that we need to be doing to get ready for hunt October like I said
this is the hardest part I showed you day one trophy star has a little dip down
and then The Wiggles of Foss hope but we're bringing structure people need
structure at this point in time it's the thing that's going to help us push us
over the edge not take ourselves at the game we're going to do it together as a
community cool all right let's take a break five
minutes on the clock when we come back uh we're gonna keep pushing [Music]

01:00
how's everyone quitting their job to do class do you have sugar people
I love it I always ask myself please don't quit your job if you don't have to
right like I I I I am not a proponent of people quitting their jobs to to
interview or to get ready to interview um uh
I just I just think it's it's easier to hunt when you're not worried about food
some people say it hones your hunting skills I I think you go home hungry a lot
when you go out the hunt anybody that's really ever hunted you know that you
come home hungry most times so it's nice to have some food at home
yeah I know it's harder I know it's harder um but I I am a big fan of trying to
whatever do whatever you can do to increase stability
whatever you can do to increase stability I think is a really important

01:01
thing for some folks maybe that is quitting right maybe that does bring
more stability and time um but I think whatever you can do to be
more stable is probably the best thing ma'am cool all right so we talked about
bringing some important things in you already said you wanted it now let's
show you what you got to do to get it right right October special Channel
special voice channels uh daily kind of data structures and algorithms time
making sure that you are really ready to go out on the hunt to get this job you
said you wanted it you're checking in every class
you're doing the homework you're doing your networking
you're pushing every day these are not new things I've been asking you to do
this since the beginning and we're gonna start incorporating some

01:02
very specific practice that's going to get us job ready okay
so first thing we're going to do this week I need you to read about string
Methods right there is this lovely lovely bit of reading here in the slides
that I need you to do read about the string Methods
add them to a new Anki deck for you I need an Anki deck that's all about
interviewing right an Anki deck just for interviewing where you're gonna put
these new methods and then you're gonna do code Wars around these methods
okay I'm gonna go check my baby real quick I'll be right back I'm gonna put
three minutes on the clock three minutes on the clock little one
just got their uh their vaccine so I don't think they're feeling too well

01:03
three minutes o'clock take an extra break right back foreign we talked about
the idea of well we are now did you want it you're checking in
you're doing the homework you're doing the networking you're pushing every day
and now we're starting to add very specific very specific things to our prep
so this week I need you to read about string Methods and then you're going to
add them to a specific Anki deck for your interviewing right
or you're interviewing and then I want you to do your code Wars

01:04
or your code challenges this weekend all themed around strings so when you go
to do your code Wars this week you can look up code Wars that are specifically
tagged as strings one of the things we have to do is we start kind of getting
ready is not jumping around or bouncing around different different types of
interviewing right we want to be doing very specific problems we can focus on
and start to see the patterns right so go ahead and make sure that this week
you read about the strings that are here in the slides you add all those methods
all the string Methods to your Anki decks and then you do code Wars around
the strings no regex you want to actually learn and practice these
methods each week we're going to have a separate set of methods that we need to
get better at and then when it comes to hunt Tober we're going to lean on those

01:05
methods and start building out to some more complex structures right so we
start off with simple methods we get better and better we add more and more
so by the time you're in hunttober you have this breadth of methods that you
can dip back into for strings for arrays for objects for all of that stuff cool
this week strings checklist I asked you to submit the
stuff for the checklist for months it's been months we were on a break but it's
been months and that checklist has a lot of stuff
that I asked you to do for your professional skills uh so if you haven't
already done the checklist I believe it's exclamation point list or actually
yeah simulation Point checklist in chat exclamation point checklist in chat
that'll give you the link to the actual checklist and that link

01:06
has everything that I need you to do and what you will notice when you go to
this link is that it was originally due in April originally due in April
I did 10 coffee chats did 10 coffee Chats on Monday and uh quite a few folks
are like Leon I haven't done the checklist yet well guess what now you
got you got a week to get it done everything that's on here
we have our portfolios we have the resume we have our LinkedIn Sean you're
on here Sean's been holding some phenomenal uh Twitter spaces if you
haven't checked them out check them out uh GitHub Twitter everything you need to
be ready professionally for the job hunt is on here all right is on here
make sure you have completed this and guess what it's due by August 30th

01:07
you got a week you want to be part of hunttober you got a week all right
team projects will be due on September 6th right we'll be due on September 6th
you will have time to learn how to add authentication this and next week and
then we'll be working on a team project next week your team project will be due
September 6th the beautiful thing about the team project is that you're going to
be using the template right so you're not starting off from zero you'll be
using the templates you're gonna be adding modifying breaking adding just a
little bit to make it your own not the Instagram clone a simpler project
wait blah your team project was only friends that's awesome yeah cool

01:08
Hit List do September 13th I want 60 companies that you're going to
apply to 60 companies on your Hit List eventually you will add five individuals
at each of those companies minimum of three shooting for five at each of these
I don't need you to have all those individuals yet I just need the
companies that you're gonna be targeting on your list
you're all here to get jobs and we got to find the jobs right so if you're
applying locally you're going to be looking for jobs
locally you're applying globally you're going to look up lists of companies that
are hiring globally if you're looking for remote only you're going to find
lists of folks that are hiring remote only and you're going to add them to
your Hit List my question to you do you still want it

01:09
I felt hundreds of folks get jobs hundreds hundreds of folks get jobs this
is how they do it it's two weeks of a lot of catching up
and two months of a lot of work at the end the end is worth it all right
Hit List September 13th if you haven't already gotten your
client signature remember I asked every single one here to get a paid client
to volunteer for a Grassroots org or to contribute to a free software open
source project if you have not done that you have until the 27th to do it
you do not get into hunt Tober without having done one of those things
because we want to verify that you participated in the program eventually
folks that are part of hunt Tober will be eligible for references there's no

01:10
way I am being a reference without these things now
I've seen something going around that does not count somebody opened up a
like make your first contribution to free software and it was like just like
like open a pull request and I'll and I'll approve it get out of here with
that that doesn't count find an actual project contribute actual code get out
of here with that this is your first no that doesn't get out of here
like what are you doing either get a client contribute to a real project

01:11
or volunteer with a Grassroots organization they got got until the 27th great
also do the 27th I want a beautiful MVP of your 100 hours project beautiful MVP
MVP is a minimum viable product it means that your 100 hours project is nowhere
near done but the core idea is there the core idea is there and it looks good
because this weekend you could start writing the ejs the HTML the CSS you all
have access to the MVC template you all have access to the MVC template with
auth already I've already linked it on the Discord
there's no reason why you can't start with that right now to start building
your 100 project and I need that mvp like the core of it
done like the core idea like what you're

01:12
trying to accomplish looking good by the 27th Hydra come back to the slides
I'll put in Discord probably not tonight but yeah
and I need the hundred dollars project done by the 11th of October
100 projects need to look good if you can't make it look good use
bootstrap use a template use something that somebody's already made look good
11 premium apps also do by October 11th don't worry about this one yet we have

01:13
to have a whole class on how to do this but basically premium apps are like the
applications that you really care about we put a little bit more effort into
those applications we're not there yet so don't worry about this one yet but
know that's something that you're gonna need to be thinking about
and know that hunt Tober is an everyday thing so I'm asking a lot
but I'm giving a lot I'm asking a lot but I'm giving a lot Tober we hunt
now you said you wanted it now's their turn to not take yourself out the game
now is your turn to lean in to go deep to figure out whatever you got left in
the tank and put it on the field it's time to carry some boats some logs
it's time to hunt it's not called The Hunt because we kind

01:14
of just like we like laugh and like we do interviews no
we go we eat people's lunch we hunt and these are the things I need if you
want to participate in the hunt together I want a community of folks that are
lean mean interviewing machines that are supporting each other for a focused
window of effort to get a job so you do these things that I've asked you to do
uh you will get added to special channels on Discord where you will have
a community of folks that are serious about getting a job that will be looking
at resumes portfolios that will have special discussions that will meet every
day to do data structures and algorithms to go through coding challenges that

01:15
will be able to talk through the problems they're having in the hunt with
the goal of getting the job you do these things you get a job
and a lot of our classes right a lot of our classes will be focused around
getting you ready for these different pieces these different Bobs and making
sure that you are ready for the hunt this is not a coding boot camp this is a
getting a job boot camp time to pay the piper it's time to get a job cool
all right um on top of all of this on top of all
of this uh you need to be keeping up with your bank
right you need to be keeping up with your Banky you need to be practicing your

01:16
behavioral questions don't let your car atrophy cause action result for all your
behavioral questions make sure you're still working through those Banky
questions those technical questions using EU explanation use example make
sure you're doing your coding challenges every day and now your cutting
challenges should be a little bit more targeted you should be doing string
problems this week everyone do string problems this week next week it'll be
something different just getting us ready ready for the hunt now
depending on how many folks we have in Hunt Tober
there will be a culmination of an interview with me there will be a
for all the folks that complete this work because it's a lot that go through
the whole process right if you submit everything you get a reference right so

01:17
you sorry you get a verification right uh when somebody says hey can you verify
that this person was a part of a hundred devs I'm gonna be like all right did
they did they check in all right did they
turn in the homework all right did they submit their networking sheet all right
did they push every day all right did they uh submit their checklist did they
submit their team project did they submit their Hit List did they get a
client An approved pull request on open source project or volunteer for a
freelancing client did they uh submit a hundred hours MVP 100 hours completed
project that they do their premium apps because if they did
there are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 100 devs graduate and
they will get verified I've hired literally hired someone to help us do
these verifications so when a company says Hey Leon was this person at 100
devs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah they were look at all the

01:18
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that they did we'll submit the
verifications and uh we'll make sure that they knew that you were here
participating can catch-up crew get verified that's
the goal the goal is to still build these systems for folks that last for a
while now the downside is that it does cost me money to do this so I got to get
this agency up and running because it's not cheap to hire people to handle
thousands of verification requests from hundreds of different companies right
hope you understand there's a lot of stuff that's happening in the background
to make this work I will never take money from students so don't even go
that route um yeah uh so that that's something we got to
think about we got to get this agency up and running
because it's a lot to do that right so I say that because some people are like
why can't you just do verifications without doing all this stuff there's no

01:19
way I'm saying that you were here if you didn't do these things right
all right this is this is me feeling
yeah you did these things [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah you
were here I know you're here I knew you put in the work I'll do everything I can
to get you the the verification letters whatever you need to help you with that
job application now once we come through hunttober there's a lot of stuff right
for folks that go through hunttober they give me their all and they also want a
they want a reference like me picking up the phone to talk to people on their
behalf well we'll do that as well um we'll the folks that make it through
hunttober they'll have the opportunity to do a final interview with me it'll be
a behavioral question it'll be some technical questions it'll be quick
pseudo coding a coding challenge you pass that I will get on the phone and be

01:20
your reference so it's a lot I asked you in the beginning if you wanted it
you said you wanted it now this is what we need to do to hunt there's a lot but
this is what gets jobs this is what gets Jobs been doing this
for a long time I don't care how good you are at coding
I don't care how well you've done up until this point you do these things
that I've asked you to do and you will be at the level that you need to get a

01:21
job questions how can we help you we're going to talk about that next week
I floated this idea last week and during office hours called 100 maintainers
there's a lot of little projects that are going to help this process go
smoothly and so we're going to need folks that want to write some code to
help 100 devs and so I've been recruiting some senior Engineers some
alumni that want to help lead projects that'll help 100 devs and make this
process go smoother and something that's maintainable for the future for the
catch-up crew so this is our first run through a lot of this we're going to get
a lot of things wrong we're going to get
a lot of things right and we're going to build systems that help all the folks
that come after us uh what would count towards an open
source PR like an actual open source project that you committed code to you

01:22
did something for that project yeah boats and logs baby yep
are global companies remote by default no at like so there are a lot of remote
companies that only hire folks from certain countries so there are a lot of
remote jobs that will only hire people from the US or like Canada right that's
not a global hiring company those are two different things now there are lots
of companies that hire a global Workforce but those are different yeah
being remote doesn't necessarily mean that you could that they will hire
anyone from anywhere oh would it contributing to 100
maintainers count as a proof PR yeah I think that would count yeah why not
how do we go about getting a reference before hunttober
um we well blah has been working on a submission form

01:23
um for folks that have already met all these things that I've asked you to do
um and we will be sharing that soon so if you've already done all the things
that I need you to do for me to feel comfortable getting on the phone and and
saying that you are like the bee's knees um you'll be able to submit all that
stuff for for ahead of time I'm a few classes behind uh Can I submit
that and catch up yep you have some time
to catch up we're also going to be doing
the uh full back-end review so if you're like close you still have some time to
catch up is Google doable without knowing
typescript angular yeah plenty of people work at Google without knowing
typescript or angular but saying can I can I work at Google is like saying can
I play for the Yankees right like maybe you could walk out of high school and

01:24
play for the Yankees but most people can't and that's okay
don't ever let your dreams be dreams though lots of things you can do to make it
into those types of companies it's just not something that I that I and
necessarily an advocate for because I think it's it's unreal expectations for
folks uh question is this the only hunt Tober
that will happen uh it's the only one that we have planned for right now
um right now this is the only hottober right like there's something special
about this being a live program uh we're definitely committing to helping the
ketchup crew be like get verification that they went through the program or
that they were at the hundred devs agency so that's something we're

01:25
committing to for the long run but another October we don't have it planned
yet but if we have another good group of folks that want it then I will do it
yeah right now we have a group of folks that
have been going through the program live that all need a focused dedicated time
to get a job and so that's what I'm going to help support
all the dates are on the slides you have Malden slides I'm sure we'll eventually
put it in Discord but they're on the slides for right now
uh our October classes weekend uh weekend and week weekday only we'll be
meeting uh every weekday but there will be stuff to do over the weekends so it
is like an everyday thing but the actual voice calls will be Monday through
Friday uh and this goes without saying like don't don't let me get in between
you and your God like a lot of folks need to take that one day off a week
like you should be taking that one day off weekly I'm expecting like six days

01:26
of code Wars not seven days of code Wars if that makes sense
uh will it be different time zone calls for October nope it'll be because we we
always have class at the same time um so it'll be around the same time we
will probably have some groups that are in different time zones that form
um last time we did Mega the mega month we had a good group of folks that met
like earlier in the day and then a good group of folks that met later in the day
so I think naturally will help that organize
uh so the people that make it that don't make it to hunt Tober won't learn about
data structures and algorithms no we still have classes that'll be regular

01:27
class time on data structures and algorithms but it won't be the learning
everyday type of uh practice like learning data structures and algorithms
is one thing putting them into practice is a whole different thing like if you
ever do any data structures and algorithms course it's worthless because
you have to do it and you have to practice it you have to put it into
practice you have to solve real problems so we'll have a class on it but then
it's going to be on you to then practice those data structures those algorithms
every single day and the cool thing about hunttober is that we will be doing
that every day uh can you still be in hunttober if
you're if you're no I hunt over to the folks to get these things done I need to
be super focused on a core group of folks that are ready to get a job right
like that that I just want to be focused I want to be locked in I want to make

01:28
sure that the folks that are ready to get the job I can help support there'll
be plenty of stuff after hunt Tober to help folks specifically like in the
ketchup crew and stuff like that but I want a group of folks that really want
it that really want to grind that really want to go on the hunt
um that's what I'm looking for uh the real ant asset the pr decided to
be for an actual project not something like like not like a repo
that somebody says contribute to open source by submitting a a PR like no like
like an actual real project um uh if you're still catching up yeah
you'd probably try to catch up like if you want if you want this then you would

01:29
have to catch up in time yeah uh gamer woman 3D send me a mod mail
please and then we'll we'll make sure you get the the link
been here since day one I feel so unready for this well that's the point
the point of doing the hunt Tober and the mega month we did last time is to
focus folks right like I know it seems like a lot I know that it's asking a lot
and I don't I don't do that lightly but it's what a lot of folks need at this
point in time or else they kind of just trickle along
and I don't want you to trickle along I want you to get a job I'm not doing this
for my health I'm doing this because I want you to get a job so I'm going to
try and focus to give a little bit of a push as I can so that folks can focus

01:30
and actually get the job that they want um you can you can do anything else you
want to trickle along but this is a getting a job program and I want you to
do the things that you need to do to get a job
and sometimes people need this push they need this Focus that's what we're going
to do can we go over at premium apps all right
we'll have a whole class in the premium Maps it's basically just like the 10
companies that you're most excited for you do more
for those applications you build like a custom project for it
um you do you do a series of things that will have a whole class on
um so it's just like it's like 10 companies that you're really excited
about and the extra things that you do to make sure that your application
stands out at those companies but we'll have a whole class on it so like I said
don't really stress about that one right now it's I know that's 100 clear but
we'll have a class on it when you said use a template for your

01:31
100 products what do you mean it means that you should not be writing that code
from scratch you should be starting probably with my MVC with off template
and building from there and then probably bringing like other templates
so that it looks good foreign [Music] with a small company doing WordPress
sites count as a client signature if you're getting paid to be a developer it
counts yeah how will being verified help me get a
job well a lot of companies want like if you say that you're a software engineer
at 100 devs they're going to want to verify that you were actually in our
training program here at 100 does so if you do these things then when you apply
to jobs you can say hey I was doing this program at 100 devs and then we'll be
the ones that'll say yep they were here they did everything they did all this

01:32
work and we'll we'll return their verifications
if the company is not hiring should we put it on The Hit List no you don't want
to put companies you can actually get a job at on The Hit List so yeah that
would you'd want you want them to be hiring
is there a limit of people going into October
um no but we'll see uh I have a feeling that it'll it'll thin a little bit
um that's not what I want to have happen but that's what happens when you ask
people to focus for a little bit right not everyone will have the privilege of
time to focus in and if you can't participate in October like that's okay
all the classes are still like you still
have class you still have all the things that you could be doing to get a job
it's just I want to light a fire underneath the folks that are ready to
start getting the job right all my classes already on YouTube all of last

01:33
cohorts already on YouTube you can go through that at your own pace but I want
a a small contingent of folks or not small as big as it can be of folks that
are like ready to actually go on the hunt the whole reason I do this is to
get people jobs and so I want to be that
little bit of a push to get folks actual jobs instead of people just trickling
along not doing the things that they know they need to be doing to get a job
this will help Focus folks and actually get a job
how much time do I have to catch up all the dates are in the slides
what if someone can't catch up well that's what the catch-up crew is for you
keep going on at your own pace class still continues like normal like
we still have a lot of classes to do live it's just October is going to be

01:34
like a special space on Discord and a special bit of focus from me
Neko why wouldn't you get verification if you've been doing everything
very so just be very very clear we are working on building systems for folks to
be verified no matter when they complete the program that's the goal
how long I can continue to do that I'm not sure because it takes a lot of time

01:35
money and effort to do that but that's the goal is try to build those systems
what if life happens in October when we miss a few things communicate
communicate communicate communicate uh so we when you verify do you get the
nft yeah that's kind of the goal is that we wanted to do something fun for
graduating uh basically all of these are also the requirements for graduating
right like you do all these things you graduate
um we've been talking about like doing a

01:36
graduation nft and some fun stuff around that um [Music]
uh how does this work for people that who already have gotten jobs do they
need verification no I mean if you get a job right like none of this is required
right like a lot of folks like get jobs without doing this right it's just if
you want these things right if these are things that you want
um that you do this stuff yeah oh all right just see if there's any more
questions in here we'll have office hours this Sunday too so if there's
things that you're worried about or things that come up as you start

01:37
thinking about this timeline um on on Sunday um
uh on Sunday you can come we'll have more time to answer these questions uh
Leon I've had horrible experiences with networking working with teams in the
past my goal is to find a job where I wouldn't have to work with others is a
coding job out of the question yeah I mean it's it's hard a lot of Engineers
really don't work in isolation they work as a team they work building products
together that's that's kind of hard the cool thing is that a lot of these jobs
are remote now and like your contact with people can be minimized there are
also people that are individual contributors and like are really good at
what they do and they kind of interact with folks less but coding is a is
really a collaborative career so that's kind of hard but I'm sure there is
definitely jobs or opportunities that fit the things that you're looking for
it's a huge base millions of jobs right you'll find something that fits what
you're looking for yeah freelancing is also a little bit

01:38
maybe different you're not working necessarily in a team but for someone um
[Music] do certs help you with the job hunt probably not no
very few ones maybe a few of the cloud starts but even those not like nobody's
gonna hire you just because you have one um as a software engineer at least
uh during October how much time do we need to be live every day
um last time we did Mega month the calls are about a half an hour each day
when we look at data structures in September is everyone building the same team

01:39
project um that'll be up to your team last time
like I gave like a general prompt and then people tweaked it to their their
wants um it's definitely better if you do your own thing or at least your own
like your own variation of it so I'll give you a general prompt and then
if your team wants to tweak it to your desires you can definitely do that cool
alrighty folks we're getting to the top of the hour
um have you decided when the what time the October discard calls will be uh not
yet once we know how many people and who's gonna be in hunttober uh we'll do
a doodle to find like what is like the best time for folks or at least the
closest time to helping the most folks um so we'll kind of pick it closer to

01:40
the actual start cool all right kind of looking like some
questions that aren't related to The Hunt that's okay um but
there's a lot here right we we agree that this was a lot uh and so your
homework is to start go start why why are you still here like like right now go
start you could be working on your strings you could be doing your code Wars you
could be finishing up your your checklist no raid just start

01:41
you said you wanted it now go and get it we don't get got we go get
