00:03
seconds to get in here what's your favorite food vegan pho

you come you come on sunday on sunday we're going to review a lot of html a
lot of css we're also going to get some javascript review in too so if you want
to see some cool layouts and then actually use javascript for real like
take javascript and do real stuff with it
come on sunday we're going to go through it oh that's a good one well yeah i'm
scared to freelance no need to be scared
we're going to go over all the big stuff tonight don't worry about it
indifferent hey thank you for the gift it subs i appreciate you thank you for

00:04
being here hope you're doing well don't worry we're going to make
everything make a little bit of sense you're going to have time to ask lots of
questions at the end of tonight's class so if there are things that still don't
make sense we're going to do kind of like a normal question and answer like
we normally do but the end of class so as we're going through all this
freelancing stuff if there's stuff that you're still scared about things that
don't make sense we have plenty of time to work on that stuff
somebody said what is my favorite freelancing project um well before i get
to that do we have enough knowledge to land a paying client yes
already you have enough information to land a paid client
so for folks that don't know i'm going to bring this up a little bit we get
further in uh i run a boot camp during the day right my
day job is running another boot camp called resilient coders
and in that boot camp we have folks in the sixth week of

00:05
program get a paid client so they learned html they learn css and just a
little bit of javascript and then in week six they have to get a paid client
in the five years that i have been in charge of program
for that boot camp we have never had someone not get a client
let that sink in for a second in six weeks five weeks technically because in the
six week they have to get the client right all right in the in the in the
in the sixth week after five weeks of just html css and javascript in five
years hundreds of people we have never ever not had someone get a paid client
because you all you need is html all you need is a little bit of css and all you
need is the tips and tricks we're about to cover tonight so if you have any
interest in getting paid with the skills that you already have
landing freelancing clients tonight's the night

00:06
right we're gonna go through everything i got to help you land those first few
clients and we have to realize like the reason why
right the reason why this all started the reason why 100 devs is even a thing
is because folks were struggling still are due to the
pandemic and we wanted to see if there was a way to get them the skills that
would help them get new jobs and to put food on the table in the meantime this
is the way you do that right the freelancing helps you
to be able to between now and getting a job have some money coming in but also
to help you get that job in the long run the
freelancing is not just a money play it is a getting a job play and we're going
to break all that down this evening so we're going to start from the beginnings
here's the agenda we're going to go through tonight we are going to we go
we are going to go through what is freelancing
we're going to talk about setting up your online presence to enable you to

00:07
freelance to find those clients we're gonna talk about finding actual clients
i don't care if you're in the us if you're remote if you're in the middle of
nowhere it doesn't matter we're gonna talk about different strategies for
everyone to find clients we're gonna talk about proposals with real examples
i'm going to give you examples of the proposals so if you watch this class you

and then we're gonna talk about reinvesting in
continuing to grow your freelancing empire and at the end we're going to
leave lots of room for questions so as we work through it lots of things are
going to come up lots of concerns are going to come up we'll share a slider
link in a few minutes go ahead and put your questions in that
slider link that i'll share in a few minutes and then at the end we'll go

00:08
through the top rated questions and make
sure everybody feels good and this won't be our only time that we talk about
freelancing it's gonna come up over and over again because you owe me a
freelancing client if you're participating in this boot
camp you all owe me to get a paid client it's one of the first big deliverables

please submitting work uh you all have been tasked with reading
through javascript.info and at the end of some of the

screenshot it doesn't matter whatever you can do to show that you did the task
that's what i want right so you can go ahead and um
you can go ahead and just put it in a code pen you can put it in a um
a screenshot of what you did i don't care just show me that you did it

00:11
yep there should only been one or technically two but yeah just the one is fine
cool how do we submit the screenshot you have

slim thug hey thank you for the fire that subs hope you're doing well
thanks for being here cool alrighty next he wants to be fancy
who wants to who wants to to show up on discord and everyone sees you everyone
you stand out amongst the crowd people see you typing in discord and they go
ooh who's that right well tonight's your chance to be fancy uh if you clip

00:12
something of the stream uh after class i am going to have a thread where
you can share your clip best clip gets a fancy color on discord
you will be the envy of all of your friends we're only doing one a stream
two one a class right so you're talking about if we only have 60 classes you'll
be one of 60 out of 27 plus thousand right
so figure out how to clip during one of our breaks and whoever has the best clip
posted in the thread you get the fancy color
now leon why why are you doing this it's not an engagement play i promise not
engagement play i want to start sharing a lot of short form
content uh right now i just looking at where eyeballs are
folks that are getting into tech that are getting into
uh learning how to code they're not investing as much as they used to in
three hour javascript classes right they

00:13
are looking for short form content to to see if this could be right for them and
we got a lot of fun stuff to share with them that might get them excited to then
come and join us live and invest in a longer form boot camp and so i want to
take some of the better moments from class the things that are really
educational the things that are really funny and share that as short form
content and one way you can help me is by clipping the fun stuff we do right
here all right and so i'm going to be taking these clips i'm going to be
turning them into short form content sharing them across other socials so yeah
best clip get special color on discord alrighty tonight we are talking
about a lot of stuff we are talking about money contracts
we're talking about entering into legal agreements
and what i really need you all to understand is that i am not a lawyer

00:14
i am not a tax professional i am not a cpa i would rate my level of kind of
understanding this stuff and where i get
my major source of understanding is bird
law and this really isn't bird law right so what you have to realize all right
this is just my ramblings as someone that has done this for the
past 10 plus years right you have to realize i'm not a lawyer i'm
not a cpa i'm not a tax professional as you freelance things might come up
you might get into a quandary you might get stuck somewhere i'm not the person
to come to you want to seek out professional help if those things do arise so
before we jump in tonight before we start talking about
how to get paid clients how to freelance i really want to make sure that you

00:15
understand i am not a lawyer and none of this is legal advice i say that again
i am not a lawyer and none of this is legal advice hold on one second one second
all right i am not a lawyer and none of this is legal advice some
folks some folks like it when i'm bigger i am not a lawyer
and none of this is legal advice alrighty beautiful i am not a tax professional
and none of this is tax or financial advice and one more time i am not a tax
professional and none of this is tax or financial advice

00:16
this is simply the ramblings of someone who has done some of this stuff before
and i think i've done a decent job at it
i think everything you could have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up when it comes to freelancing i have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up i've i've
absolutely made all the mistakes that are out there to be made and
i'm trying to synthesize the things that have helped save my butt
and the butts of my students in the past but understand the only reason i'm able
to do that is because i've probably messed it all up before so i hope
tonight you get excited about freelancing i hope you get excited about um
having this new avenue of expression to to work with others to build really cool
stuff but realize that it's a journey right i'm synthesizing my journey my

00:17
perspective in an attempt to help you cool a big
disclaimer is that this is going to be my perspective and so that's going to
heavily skew to the us and the uk most of my contracting has happened in
the u.s and the uk not that these skills won't be
applicable to everyone i really do think the things we share tonight really
doesn't matter where you're located doesn't matter where you're coming from
you can do the stuff we're going to talk
about tonight i just want to put that as
a disclaimer i'm from the u.s i know the things that have been tricky in the u.s
but i might not know the very specific intricacies of contract work in your
country or your location right so that's something to keep in mind
last cohort we had students from all over the world we had students in india
get clients we had students in brazil get clients we had students in the uk
get clients we had students in poland clients we had students in all these
different countries that got clients i'm just letting you know tonight my
perspective is that as someone that's only really ever done client work in the

00:18
us and the uk cool now the why why do i like to introduce freelancing so
early and why do i like to make sure that all of my students freelance
i have two major reasons why freelancing is such a big component of all the boot
camps that i run uh one is about money and the other is about
experience i shared the the money issue before but i'm going to just
reiterate it because i think it's it's important it really does
highlight why i do this so for me um when i was in university i moved off campus
and i would often spend the summers working in labs or
trying to get an extra study in and there came a point where i ran out of

00:19
money i didn't even have money for food i started asking around to get help
nobody could help and i was hungry so what i decided to do was to see
if someone would pay me for the skills that i had i had been building websites
web applications i had always had an interest in entrepreneurship i had always
wanted to build stuff and i had been doing that i had had smaller projects
that i had launched but i really just had html and css skills there was
nothing really fancy beyond that and so for me i was like wait a minute
um let me see if someone will pay me for the html and css skills that i have i
went on craigslist i posted hey i'll build your website web application i am
in the city that i was in and literally that day someone got back to me said yes
i need something built they paid a deposit and i skipped my
whole way to the grocery store to buy pasta and pasta sauce and i ate

00:20
handsomely for a very long time that moment changed my life
like that like if you think about like if i think about my life that that was it
in that moment i knew that i had a skill
that no one would ever take away from me
i had a skill that when i needed to turn it on would put food on the table would
make sure that i could live my life and it it clicked something clicked my
brain that tech could be an equalizer it could be a way if i if i honed those
skills to not only get paid but to have a very different life and i had a
phenomenal life since that moment right went on to raise millions of dollars in
venture capital i've built some amazing companies i've taught a lot of folks
tech that have helped them get amazing jobs as well so for me the freelancing
is something that i want for every single person that ever comes into my

00:21
classroom i want you to have that belief in yourself
to be able to get the job done and get paid
your life is different when you know you don't have to rely on a boss we want to
rely on somebody else's job when you know you can hustle
make good money and provide for yourself and your family so to me
that unlocks something in my brain in my soul in my heart and in my life that i
want for each and every single one of my students
and the honest truth is just with the skills you have now
you can do it just html just css you can do it i've had hundreds of students
with less skills than you have right now get amazing high paid clients
i want that for you now like i said at rc their bootcamp run during the day

00:22
in week six so after just five weeks of learning our students
in the past five years have never not gotten a paid client within that week so
tonight i'm teaching you everything that they know everything that the last
cohort of 100 devs knows to get jobs and sorry to get clients and to do
it quickly we're going to talk about playing the
game i'm going to show you how to play the game it's up to you to play it okay
now the second part the second reason why getting a client
is so important has nothing to do with just the initial money
it has to do with the fact that you smell
every student coming out of a boot camp has a has a has a stench a scent
and every company you apply to the recruiter the engineering manager they

00:23
can smell it they can smell that new engineer smell right and that stench
that smell is what's going to stop you from getting jobs and let me explain why
when somebody tries to hire an engineer how much do you think it costs to get an
engineer in the door like to to find an engineer that's going to start working
for you chat throw it in chat how much do you think it costs to get someone in
the door and ready to start working that's some pretty good guesses
it's anywhere from like 10 to 30 000. i work with a lot of companies that
really do spend that 20 to 30 grand per hire so let's let's just for the sake of
argument take the higher amount you spent 30k to get someone in the door
because remember it takes a lot of interviewing time it takes a lot of

00:24
recruitment time maybe you're paying a recruitment fee maybe you're paying for
the advertising to get those folks in the door right so let's say 30 grand all
in to get someone in the door now most engineers take anywhere from
like three to six months to fully ramp up right most engineers they join a new
team they start getting some small wins some small tickets completed but like
really three months to get like up to speed and feeling comfortable on the job
right sometimes if you have a more complicated team a
more complicated stack poor documentation that three months can turn
into like four or five or six but let's say three months so
you hired an engineer it cost you 30 grand to get them in the door
and their salary is 100k a year so it's going to take 30 grand to get

00:25
them in the door 30 grand to get them paid for those first three months
probably another 10 grand on top of that in terms of like benefits things like
that and maybe like another 10 grand in terms of like relocation bonuses work
from home bonuses paying someone on staff to take donate
their wing like let's say anywhere from like 70 to 80 000
they get someone in the door and within the first three months to
figure out if they're a fit 60 to 80 000
just to figure out if this person can be a good fit for the company
right to see if they can be an engineer that'll be there for the long haul
right and the sad thing is if you invest
all that money they're probably going to stay there for one to two years and
they're going to jump ship to another company so it is super expensive

00:26
to get engineers in the door and working and in those first three months you
might not be really sure if they're fit yet and it might take you that 60k to
figure it out so now when an engineer comes to the doorstep
and they don't have anything that proves that they could be a good
fit that stench is overwhelming that scent is a proxy for
risk all of us as entry-level engineers are way too risky to hire
right that scent is risk no company in their right mind can bring
on an entry-level engineer and risk 60 000 on a hunch on a few coding challenges
that you did well on maybe one or two interviews that you knocked out the park
because even if you do that it's still 60k on the line

00:27
so how do we get rid of this smell how do we take a really good shower how do
we de-risk ourselves the number one way to do it is to have someone that has
already employed you if you've already been working for someone else
the hiring managers the recruiters see that and they go well it worked out with
those people so probably it'll work out with us
that's why getting your second or third job is so much easier than getting your
first engineering role because if you've already worked for
somebody else for a couple of months a year then that risk that stench is gone
so freelancing is great we get the bag we get paid
clients but it's so much more than just the money it's the shower it is the
getting rid of the stench it is the de-risking of yourself so that more

00:28
hiring partners more recruiters can say with gusto that you're a good fit you
should join their company knowing that they're not risking that 60k
right and the more clients you have the more clients that are willing to be
references for you the easier it is to get that first job i'm gonna show you
tonight some folks their portfolios their contracts that took them from
never having worked in tech to working at some of the biggest companies that we
all know i'm gonna show you exactly what they did how they did it the messages
that they sent their portfolios their twitters i'm going to show you
everything this evening and know that freelancing is not just about getting
the bag it's also about getting the job that makes sense
that makes sense why like why freelancing is so important and why i

00:29
want that for you cool all right now i am going to show you how to play the game
it is up to you if you want to play it the things i'm going to show you tonight
i have been called shady for i have been called scammy for
scummy for i have been called [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on because what happens
when you have hundreds of people that have gotten paid clients in five weeks
when folks that have been doing this for five years haven't is they get a little
they get a little touchy they get they get a little they get a
little they get a little hateration in their heart right they get a little jelly
exactly you get a little salty as i used to say back in the day all right

00:30
and the things i'm going to show you are going to cut corners
the things i'm going to show you are going to be what folks that have never
done this before might consider not the right way
and my overwhelming response to them is go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself
i have helped hundreds of students that need the money
that need the clients to put food on the table that are in
the worst of times due to the pandemic this is for them it's not for you i
don't care about your hot take on templates i don't care about your hot
take on free hosting i don't care about your hot take on
stuff that you have no idea what you're talking about you can get out of here
and you can go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself all right every time i teach this class
i get dms i already know i'm getting dms on twitter well leon i don't know about

00:31
that template thing no you're wrong just just don't just close your eyes
take out your headphones walk away don't need you what i'm about to talk about
are things that cut corners but at the end of the day you are still
going to provide amazing value to your clients
and you're gonna do what's in their best interest nobody else matters
right if at the end of the day your clients are happy
they have the things that they want it that's all that matters
they can go pound sand exactly so i was going to throw out this disclaimer
now i'm going to teach you how to play the game it's up to you if you want to
play it there are going to be some folks out there that want to say uh that
it might be shady maybe a title unethical
it might be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whatever else they
can conjure up but they haven't done it and they haven't done it at the scale

00:32
that we've done it uh at rc or at 100 devs right and so to the haters
xd thank you for the gift it subs uh to the haters uh please
uh allow me a a brief reading of the folks that have played the game you ready
so i i sent out a survey uh to folks that that graduated
uh and we we had a lot of folks that filled it out
uh so this reading goes out to all my haters uh and one of the question was if
you landed a paid client how much were your total contracts worth
and this is this is to a hundred devs folks that have graduated from the last
cohort so allow me the reading from last cohort just the folks that
filled out the survey if you graduated and you're here and you haven't filled
out the survey i gotta bone the pick with you fill out the survey please
we need you to fill out the survey so we can we can share this with more folks

00:33
but a rating a reading okay this is from 100 devs graduates that did the co last
cohort if you landed a paid client how much were your total contracts worth
uh please include your local denomination first answer 28 000 so far this year
200 200 600 1000 canadian dollars 200 800 3 000 pounds 6 400 u.s dollars no
400 200 8 two hundred one fifty two thousand two
hundred usd and they made a note that said it was a static website
two hundred six hundred fifty dollars fifty dollars all right whatever a

00:34
thousand currently negotiating uh more contracts 250 500 250. 239.96 okay
two thousand one hundred five hundred one thousand three hundred dollars five
hundred two fifty eighteen hundred twelve hundred forty one hundred nine
hundred one thousand two hundred three fifty 1600 1200 300
it keeps going folks it keeps going and these are all folks from the last
100 devs cohort exactly jasmine bruh so i'm going to teach you
how to play the game it's up to you if you want to play

00:35
but i just read out for the folks that did play but it was worth it to them
so you want to do 100 devs they said well if you want to do 100 devs here's
the requirement you owe me a paid contract by the end of
this month you don't have to have the project done i need the signed contract
with this side contract the amount must be for 200 us dollars or more
and it cannot be a close friend or family member member doesn't mean you
can't use friends or family to negotiate and get somewhere else but 200 or more
no close friends or family members it could be a friend from three years
back that the kid that sat behind you in 10th grade math class their fair game
no close friends no family members 200 u.s whatever that is in your
denomination now there will be some folks that are not
able to freelance that this is i'm not calling you out i'm not talking about

00:36
you um some folks um if this would cause you harm please
don't do it uh if this would violate your visa please don't do it uh if there
if taking or entering into a contract is not something you're actually like
legally able to do please don't do this there will be
exceptions there'll be other things to do contributing to open source projects
um working on larger project teams things that volunteering there'll be other
things that you can do that'll get you most of the same benefits
but i'm not talking to those individuals i'm talking about the folks that have
the privilege of being able to do this sign contract end of the month
it's a beautiful day it's the first of the month you got a full month to do it
i'm going to show you how you can do it no close friends or family it can be an
acquaintance now there's going to be a lot of questions that come up as we
work through how to freelance and so here is the

00:37
slido for the evening you can do exclamation point ask
right or you can just go to slider.com and type in that number
uh at the end of the stream we're going to go through the questions that are on
the slido please upvote the questions that you
would want to be answered uh don't put just generic stuff we're going to get
we're going to cover a lot of material tonight so like don't jump the gun and
try and ask questions that we'll probably answer as we go through but as
as things come up if you have questions about them throw them in the slido
upvote the ones that you care to see answered at the end we will answer them
together cool we ready we're going to do this thing
i'll leave the slide up for a second just so folks can grab the number if
they need it yes please let's go all right all right we're going to jump into

00:38
what is freelancing and take it from there but one thing i want
on your brain before we go into this i just read off a lot of numbers
you saw some that were at the 200 range and you saw some that were in the
thousands of dollars range the only difference between someone that got 200
and someone that got a couple thousand was that they asked for a couple thousand
when it comes to freelancing they're gonna be some folks that
undervalue themselves and they're gonna be some folks that value themselves
appropriately that's it that's all there is to it some folks
know their worth and ask for it and some
folks have to build up the confidence to get there you right now

00:39
have skills that no one else has the folks that you're going to be working
with to build their sites to do this freelancing they're not going to put in
the time that you put in you're on class 15 hundreds of hours now spent in class
outside of class homework reading doing building
no one that's running a business is gonna take those hundred hours to do
what you just did so they can understand what's going on in the things that
they're building folks come to me and they say leon what about wix what about
squarespace what about all these things and my question to you is do you know
how to use squarespace because if you don't and you're an
engineer then somebody's running a business won't they're not going to
spend the time to figure it out so what you have to realize is that as a
freelancer what people are paying you for is not what you do
but all the things you had to learn to be able to do the things that you do

00:40
and they pay you right they pay you for the things
that you provide business value towards right so remember they're not paying you
for fingers on keyboard they're paying you for the business value that you
provide and all the learning and hard work you had to do to get to where you are
so what the heck is freelancing um i love that this gif because it
highlights what freelancing really is like in the u.s um
i think the the number is one in three professionals is a freelancer right 36
of professionals freelance and that's about 59 million americans
and so what the heck is it freelancing means you're working as an
independent person or company rather than being employed by someone else right

00:41
instead of being employed by a company you're providing value or services to
another company right and you're working independently
now there are a lot of other terms when it comes to freelancing and your country
might have its own terms as well so you might have heard people referring to
freelancing as self-employed independent
contractor contract job or contract work or contract role might have heard the
term consultant or specifically in the u.s 1099.
these are all terms to mean right right to mean right that you are
an independent person not being employed but providing value to that company
now in the us specifically we have two different terms we have w2 and 1099
folks that are employed by a company they have at the end of the year a form

00:42
sent to them called a w-2 it shows them the salary they got paid
all the money that got taken out for taxes right
an independent contractor at the end of the year will get a 10.99 right it's a
form in the u.s each country has their own thing so i'm just going to talk
about the us for right now but each country each country has like
their own different way of doing it so at the end of the year if you are a
independent contractor you will receive a 1099
from a company that highlights how much money you made but they do not do
anything else when you are a freelancer or an independent contractor
no taxes are withheld you do not get insurance you get no work extras no 401k
contributions no no health benefits no contributions to
retirement right you get none of that stuff but you get the full check

00:43
and you get to be your own boss and you get to offset or write off some of your
expenses right right and so it's something to keep in mind that when
you work for someone as a w-2 you get all those taxes with how to get
those other perks but you're not your own boss you're not writing off your own
expenses it's a different beast and so i mentioned this as a huge huge bag
that if you go this freelancing route your taxes will not be withheld that is on
you right it is the first thing i must bring up to you remember i'm not a
lawyer i'm not a tax professional i'm not a cpa but please pay your taxes
when you work as an independent contractor when you get at 1099 at the
end of the year no taxes are withheld what most contractors do is when they

00:44
get a job 30 to 40 percent of that job they put in a savings account right
at least 30 some people do 40 just to feel a little bit more safe right
because the company is not taking that money out for you and sending it to the
government you have to send it yourself and if you wind up freelancing a lot
you're eventually going to be paying your taxes quarterly in the u.s so
remember if you are freelancing if you are contracting if you are 1099 whatever
you want to call it where you are doing work for another company but are not
currently employed by that company you must set aside some money for your taxes
cool 30 40 is what most folks do alrighty now tonight
we're going to talk through all the big things when it comes to
getting a client we're going to talk about building our online persona and
i'm going to show you some examples we're going to talk through how to find

00:45
clients we're going to talk through the proposals that you're going to send to
those clients we're going to talk about the contracts that you're gonna send to
those clients we're talking about how to close a client like you you've got
somebody on the hook how do you seal the deal and talk about delivering that
value and then reinvesting and building your your empire yeah so
lots of stuff to get in tonight lots of fun stuff to kind of dip our our toes
into and what you're going to realize right is that
it takes a little while to get the momentum going so a lot of this is
setting ourselves up to win a lot of this stuff has to simmer before you can
start to generate leads and um a lot of things we're going to talk
through tonight we're going to get to in more detail even as the cohort goes on

00:46
cool echo yep always saved alrighty all right let's talk about your online
persona it's business folks uh there is the the trifecta of your
online presence uh that you need established if you're going to do
freelancing in my opinion you want to have a solid portfolio you
want to have a decent twitter and a decent linked in now when folks
see this the portfolio the twitter the linkedin they think it has to be
something um like really intense or well thought like like
like a meticulous detail no it's actually some stuff that are very simple
to do you just have to do it the right way so
the portfolios i'm going to show you tonight are simple but effective the
twitter i'm going to show you is simple but effective the link that i'm going to
show you is simple but effective it's not something i need you to run off

00:47
and spend hours and hours and hours on no we need to set up our baseline
all right make sure we have the basics covered and then we have to let this
stuff marinate so when you start your professional presence online
it's gonna take about six months for all that stuff to really start showing up
right so you wanna start now no matter if you want to use it down the
line you want to start now so that over those six months it'll start to
show up now a lot of folks what i recommend you start off with is using
your first name last name or your just your name that you identify as as like
your presence online some folks don't feel comfortable with
their like personal presence being online and they'll start like an agency
or some sort of business entity or name that they work under and that's
something you can do but it's way easier when you use a name or a moniker or

00:48
something that you can be identified as that works well for your portfolio
twitter and linkedin right i'm not talking about like setting up an
llc or anything like that we'll talk about that at the end but just like it's
a decision you make am i going to work underneath uh a business name or am i
going to work underneath my own name or the name that identify as right
the the benefit of working underneath your name is that it's easier to be found
it is easier to enter into contracts it's easier to kind of get a few leads
but it's a decision that you'll make is an llc necessary not yet we're going
to talk about that at the end though cool now let's talk about the trinity here
we have two examples that i want to show you when it comes to portfolios
the first portfolio i'm going to show you is our mod extraordinaire blah blah

00:49
got an amazing thousand dollar contract and then an amazing job if you came to
the alumni panel uh you heard about the job they landed the amazing salary that
they locked down uh knowing that they went from kind of no
technical experience before to a senior role for their first role and it's going
well so i want to show you blah's portfolio
and when i was talking to them today the thing they brought up is that right now
they have too much inbound interest where they're
literally turning down offers or handing those those like clients off to other
people and they literally just had somebody
reach out to them they handed that off to another 100 devs member and that 100
devs member actually locked down that client
right so i'm going to show you blah's portfolio first and i want you to keep
in mind that they got a great client paid a thousand dollars
they had more clients coming to them that they passed the other folks that

00:50
then also got those clients they got an amazing job right and let's keep our
let's keep our mind on that so let's look at blogs first the this is their
link to their portfolio you can click on it or i'll just type it in
here's where we are hi my name is barbara i'm a full stack software
engineer uh please take a look around and right off the bat they can say i
need a site or i need a dev right they're they're just trying to say like
what are you looking for you need you need a website built you need a
developer to join your team uh is your web presence working for you
right and they kind of give a little pitch about the things that they're able
to do they show their past work they talk
about their services they give a little bit about themselves and then the
ability to connect so very very simple right straight to the point nothing too
wild out here you don't have to you don't have to really reinvent the
wheel each time here like it's it's good

00:51
but you're going to start to notice some things as we move through here [Music]
spectral salon let's take a look at this what does this look like folks
what does this look like people are like that's our homework exactly
their homework but look at it look at the way what they did here this is this
is expert what they did here this looks like a real salon no one would ever know
that this was homework right that's what i'm asking you to do when i say make
something your own make it your own when you do homework
make it look like a real salon right looks like a real salon you would
never know say anything about some of their other
examples too right an artist portfolio a face painting business right they look
like real sites so even if you don't have clients yet you can build out three

00:52
sites that are probably just your homework right and add them to your portfolio
every single person that's been here and
has done the homework has stuff they can use for their portfolio
all right now the other thing too is we start to kind of like go down here i
notice something here we have like a nice contact form
the beautiful thing is that you're like i'm going to do contact forms i don't
know how to do email if you use netlify for hosting which
we're going to talk about in a second which is completely free
you can literally have a form that you just put the netlify tag on right you
put netlify on the tag and then that's it that's it you're done
right netlify and you're done and your forms just work it's literally an
attribute value pair and then your form works and the and you can you can treat
it like you can start accepting emails so you're likely i don't know how to do
forms i'm going to show you it's easy just put netlify on there it's done no

00:53
php no any of that stuff now the very last thing is you'll see down here hold on
html5 up hmm interesting it's a template our our fearless leader used a template
right they did not code this from scratch they used a template right
you fill in the gaps and you keep moving right because look
they got a thousand dollar client they had so many people coming to them
that they literally had to hand off clients to other people they got an
amazing six-figure job and they did it with the template all right let's take a
look next person so this is sean uh sean was one of my

00:54
students at rc and now they've been a tireless mentor at 100 devs and so
i wanted to keep theirs on there sean went from kind of real no technical
experience just doing a little bit of learning on their own to now working at
amazon uh their first client right their first client was for
fourteen hundred dollars for one thousand four hundred and ninety five dollars
right so they went from kind of no technical experience a bootcamp
and then landit an amazing client and a fang offer right let's take a look
at their portfolio hi i'm sean your next software engineer
they're not they're not pulling any pulling any stunts here they're saying
hey i'm your next software engineer hire me today don't delay hire me today
right and look at their last projects some simple mirn stack stuff that we'll
do together some fun stuff that they built but nothing here is wild a few

00:55
sites a few games a few full stack apps and that's it this portfolio
got them a great paying client and an amazing job offer once again
what do you think they're using template using a template right
don't waste your time so many folks when they first think about freelancing
think they have to do all this crap they think they have to
have an original design they think that they have to set up an llc they think
they have to buy a domain they think they have to uh have a business entity
they think they have to do all the spending all this money to get started
you can freelance for 100 free if you're spending any money before somebody pays

00:56
you you have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up if you have paid any money
at all i don't care about hosting i don't care about the mains anything if
you've paid any money you have messed up that first contract you locked down you
take that deposit and you can use it do whatever the heck you want
all right but let's look my favorite thing about this it's changed now
it's changed now now they're making the big bucks at amazon right so this
changed but look at their original link to their portfolio let's look at this
trials.netlify.app what you're telling me you can get a
over thousand dollar client and an amazing job without even buying a domain name

00:57
if you're hosting your stuff on netlify not only is it free to host it on
netlify but you can get this lovely netlify.app and nobody cares nobody cares
all the stuff that's in your brain saying i have to buy a domain i have to
buy a beautiful landing page no it just doesn't matter
all this can be done for free so i wanted to show you these two
amazing examples because they they took something they made it their own and
then they focused on the stuff that matters the stuff that matters is
actually talking with your clients helping to provide value to them
building that relationship with them all this other stuff you can set up in a
weekend you can do it for free you have to pay a dime all right all right
we're at the top of the hour um i want us to take our break and then i'm
going to tell you the thing that people hate when i share all right we're going
to i'm going to do it and we're going to they hate it when i share it so we're

00:58
going to come back to that let's go and take our break
uh if you're new around here we like to take a break at the top of the hour
we're in this for the long call we're in this to be software engineers for the
rest of our career i'm gonna make sure that we're if you're able we're getting
up we're moving around we're hydrating we're letting our eyes focus on
something in the distance and we'll be back in five minutes
so let's go ahead and put five minutes on we're gonna keep looking at some uh
beautiful stuff when we get back more tips more tricks
but the the big thing take away here folks
you start freelancing 100 for free you don't have to pay a dime to do this
not to pay for hosting not to pay for domains you have to pay for templates
anything i'm going to show you how to do it when you get back five minutes

00:59

01:00

01:01
i'll see you soon history do forgot to run ads and run ads for two minutes

01:02
so folks can join us do yeah nine seconds left on the end alrighty folks
welcome back alden regat oh no uh so folks that
weren't here last class i'm running ads during the break because you should be
taking a break anyway and it stops folks from not being able to join and getting

01:03
ads or some folks are getting like while
we're teaching ads so i don't want folks
to get ads while we're teaching so we're just going to run ads during our breaks
always a grass type starter thank you rockstar hope you're doing well
am i required to run ads no i'm not it's like not part of my agreement but which
will just run them anyway and so folks were getting them while we were teaching
and that can't happen all right folks come on back come on back

01:04
let's do this thing alrighty so let's chill the music already so we talked about
we talked about two portfolios i gave you two examples of folks that
there's no technical experience before a boot camp right just a little bit of
learning on their own went from building out a portfolio that
got them over a thousand dollars each and also both six-figure jobs right so
those portfolio examples i'm going to show you where you can get similar
templates in a second the next thing i want to show you are twitters
there's two people that i think that have done twitter really well that i
want to highlight one is naya who was one of my rc
students and now has been a fantastic mentor uh for a hundred devs they did a
t-spill uh last cohort where they shared everything that they did
they are the person that has gotten the like highest paid client i've ever seen

01:05
out the gate and so they shared all the details of how they
landed a 70 000 client what first client right off the gate uh so i
wanted to highlight them again because they they destroyed the game
and so they did two things that i really loved
uh their twitter changes every once in a while every once in a while like what
what what they share on their twitter but i love
their sayings whenever you look at their twitter they do something really well
uh so the original one they had was your
inclusive tech leader founder and cto of afros and ai so they branded their
their agency as afros and ai they label themselves software engineer and black
tech twitter as like the hashtag of choice right when you come to their
twitter that's what you see that's what you think they are like that like you
have no idea who nia is you see that and you're like boss mode right same thing
they've an earlier one they had with software
engineer abolitionist community right they put the things in there they care

01:06
about right even now they change their twitter to earth and code it's the same
thing they talk their talk they show their strength and i bring this up
return of the z a thank you i bring this up because
the way you describe yourself the way you talk about yourself is
what people are going to believe about you right now nya can talk to talk and
walk the walk right but so many folks i see when they start their freelancing
journey still have aspiring in their in their twitter bio i'm an
aspiring software engineer they have a junior and they're in there and they're
in their title right no one wants to hire an aspiring software engineer
no one wants to hire a junior software engineer

01:07
you're a software engineer you have aspiring if you have a junior take it
out of your title now no one's going to hire you with that in
your title talk your talk and then walk that walk right
so definitely give naya a follow they're an amazing developer um
and they're a really good example of how to through hard work and really good
community building will amazing clients and amazing contracts cool
the other person we can't talk about somebody that's amazing and able to build
uh great relationships and land amazing clients without talking about sam
so sam is a hundred devs alumni they're now a developer advocate a material ui
and they share some of the best right the best right some of the best
information on how to freelance how to get clients and they have a phenomenal

01:08
story about how they went from learning the technical skills and immediately
applying them uh to bring in more money than they were at their
normal job and so i love the advice that they share and they've
helped a lot of other 100 devs folks make more money
get better clients get bigger contracts and so that's why they have their own
hashtag sorry their own their own command here in chat you can do
exclamation point sam and get their link as well but definitely give nai and sam
a follow they're two people that i know have done the best at
taking the raw skills they have and translating it into clients and their
twitter is something that you'd want to model as well now
we're going to talk about how to build those relationships as we kind of
continue on but the reason why a portfolio and twitter are so important
is because twitter ranks really high so if you are trying to get like the the

01:09
the above the fold on google stacked with your name or your agency name
twitter is that thing that's going to help boost in the search engine results
and so some folks don't feel too comfortable
twitter but you got to get comfortable with it because it will help any of your
other stuff rank a little bit higher right so that's why i push twitter
last is linkedin when folks are trying to evaluate if
they're going to work with you to build their like products they're
typically going to google you and hopefully they find your portfolio
they find your twitter and then a lot of folks will look for your linkedin and a
lot of folks kind of freak out about their linkedin
so i'm going to show you a linkedin of someone that's gotten good clients but
also has gotten a great job uh so andy is one of my past students and
um i just want to show you their linkedin and i have permission to share
all this stuff like i'm not putting people on blast i asked the permissions

01:10
when i first did the the cohort uh so here's andy's linkedin
and i they're they're an engineer at draftkings
and i want to show just kind of their their basic activity they have their
experience as an associate software engineer they have their experience at a
boot camp and they have the thing they did before that's it
three things you're gonna see this pattern come up over and over again of three
things i don't care what you've done in the past i don't care what you're going
to do in the future you really only need three
things all right so you saw one thing from their past their boot camp and
where they're at now if we go back and we look at at sean's examples right if
we look at sean's resume you're gonna see this pattern of three show up again
they have what they did in the past they have uh what they're doing now and

01:11
their boot camp experience right and so what you're going to have happen
is that i'm going to share eventually resume templates right and
other templates as we kind of go on we're always going to have this like
rule of three where you're going to talk about something you've done in the past
and talk about your boot camp experience
and until you get a job your third thing is your freelance experience
right you're going to talk about a past job your current your current experience
right and then your freelance experience and so we're going to put that on our
resume we're going to put that on our linkedin and the way we talk about it
right the way we talk about it is we talk about your past experience framing it
framing it as something that's going to lead you to tech you talk about your
boot camp experience not as a boot camp we never put those words anywhere on our
resume our linkedin our portfolio we talk about 100 devs as an agency

01:12
and if folk give you pushback you say the agency has a training program and
that's what you're all in right you're you're all in 100 devs academy right
you're in the training program of the agency and then you have your own
freelancing whatever you want to call it
first name last name consulting whatever you want to call it those are the three
things that you're going to put on your resume you're going to put them on your
linkedin you're going to put them on your portfolio and you don't have to
stress about other stuff if you want to fill in more stuff you have a longer
work history that's okay but a lot of folks are coming to us with maybe a
shorter work history or some gaps and so those three things
are what fill the gaps and your freelancing is smaller or larger
depending on the gaps that you have to fill if you haven't worked for the past
year do the pandemic it's the best time ever to say oh i was freelancing for
that past year if you have a larger gap well guess what you are freelancing
during that gap and then you're going to get clients that are references that

01:13
help you get past that smell and help explain that gap now as we start to work
in the future i'm going to give you resume templates
i'm going to give you linkedin templates i'm going to give you all this stuff
it's going to make it easier to build out those presences in terms of gearing
for a job but this week for your homework i'm going to
ask you to build out your portfolio and actually build out your twitter i'm
going to ask you to build out your linkedin you're going to keep it simple
just enough that when you're talking to a client and they google you or they
look at you on linkedin or they look at you on twitter they see something and
they go oh okay i can talk to this person that's all we're working about that's
all we're worried about for right now in the future we'll build more stuff we'll
do more stuff etc now some folks are currently working
somewhere great that's one of your three right you're gonna have wherever you're

01:14
currently working and then either 100 devs or you're freelancing but keep it
simple nothing too wild cool now the thing that i get the most hate for
the thing that um i know i got a dm already for like i
just i just whenever i talk about this especially we got so many people here i
just don't have a dm about it and there'll be some person that's gonna be
like well i don't know about this go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself all right so
here you go are you a developer true are you a designer probably not some of
you are though right so if you're a designer equals true then
you should go ahead and design your portfolio
but if you're not a designer or designer is set to false you should use a
template okay so are you a designer if so go ahead and

01:15
design the portfolio of your dreams but if you're not a designer get out get
over it use a template and here's the other thing too
if you're not a designer and you're working for a client use a template
for your clients huh i gotta get bigger if you are not a designer
use a template for yourself and use a template for your clients remember
your job is to provide value to your clients
they are going to appreciate the cost savings that you provide to them by
using a template if they had to pay for a designer to
design something and then for you to build it that cost real money
so by using a template they wind up with something very professional

01:16
something that helps them accomplish their business goals it saves them money
and it's easier for you that is a win-win win we all agree all right
can we tell them that that's up to you some folks come off the cuff i use
templates it saves you money some folks don't tell their clients to use
templates and they go that's kind of up to you that's your move that's what i
said i'm going to show you how to play the game
it's up to you how you want to play and how you want to play it
some folks don't snitch on themselves some folks snitch on themselves it's up
to you how smooth a talker are you will your client care will your client
even know what the heck you're talking about right
can i share something that i that i'm allowed to tell you lawless client

01:17
wanted a wix website let's sink in for a second thousand dollar client
wanted it done on wix all right you want it done on wix i'm
happy to do it do you know how to use wix the client will say no great i will
build you the site of your dreams on wix it's going to cost a thousand dollars
right that's that's how the conversation went
right remember it's about the value you provide not the tools you use
alrighty now i've shown some templates uh the place i like to start with
templates right the place i want to start with templates is html5 up
um they're completely free and from what i could find uh they're just not shady
uh a lot of these places where you download free templates it's always

01:18
weird stuff weird ads i don't know it's a hot mess
but html5 up from what i can see and what i've used are
pretty good templates just regular html nothing more wild than html and css
right completely free to use and no shady stuff and um
you'll notice as you look through html5 up i think we broke it oh great
as you look through it you'll start to notice some stuff wait a minute oh
this editorial template that looks pretty similar and if we keep scrolling
let's see where's the other oh this photon template looks kind of similar
i don't know we gave it the old 100 devs hug of death
that's all right it'll come back up when we're done all right so

01:19
html5 up completely free easy to use free to download has helped
lots of folks get high paying clients why would you use anything else
right why would you use anything else well after you get your first client right
after you get your first client you want to reinvest right you want to reinvest
and so after your first client you might move on to some more
advanced templates that are a little bit closer to the niche or the the the job
that you're trying to do and you might look at things like rap bootstrap or
theme forest these are like pretty popular places to get templates there
are so many other places to get templates but the idea here is you don't
do this on your first your first rodeo right after you get
some money coming in the door you can always upgrade but the idea here is that

01:20
you can do it for free cool hosting you can do it for free
netlify.com drop is the easiest hosting you will ever find
you literally take your folder and drag it to the browser window and it
is hosted you can then change the domain to whatever you want it to be
at netlify.app right 100 free i have so many clients and i know so many of my
students have their clients solely on netlify entirely for free
because for most of the client you're working with early on you're talking
more like mom and pop businesses lower traffic where it just
it just doesn't just doesn't matter right how much traffic they're going to

01:21
get they're just not going to get a lot right and so netlify is completely free
you get a netlify app if you want and then if they want to get a domain you
charge them for like you put that in part of your proposal right
this works everywhere yeah um it should work for pretty much everyone it's
completely free hosting it's super easy to host stuff you literally drag your
folder into the browser and it's hosted that's it
that's it you're done right so you don't have to worry about hosting you don't
have to worry about templates it's all free
how do how is it free how do they make a profit well it's very cheap to host
static sites and by static we just mean like html css a little bit of javascript
now that's kind of trivial to host it's very little money but they want you to
integrate netlify as your development tool right so um now that i build bigger
sites with beefier front ends i still use netlify i got got they hooked me
with free stuff that i use for myself and all my clients but as i want more

01:22
featureful stuff i want bigger stuff i want other stuff then you pay a little
bit right but the idea here is that you don't
you have to pay out the gate just works it's free it's easy to use uh yeah
but it's not but it's it's very like i don't want to like say that people like
oh like i'm gonna no it's just that there are other services that they
provide and once you're already in the ecosystem it's just easy to use those
other services too juicy said do we need to write
server-side stuff for these basic websites that's up to you and your
client a lot of the first clients you'll probably work with won't have back ends
and if you do get with a client that wants a back-end we're going to talk
about how to handle that in a bit domains uh i showed you someone that got

01:23
that got an amazing high paying client a job at a fang company and they just use
netlify.app so you don't need anything other than netlify.app for yourself
a lot of times your clients will want to put their site on their own domain
right and so what i'll typically do is i'll have them buy a domain on one of
these two registrars or if you want your own domain you can buy it on these two
registrars i love namecheap i've been a namecheap
customer for 10 years now plus probably um they have always had amazing support
whenever something's been a problem um they they have helped me they've gone
out of their way um they they do all they do the most right they do the most
in the best way possible and they've just been a phenomenal host right so a
phenomenal domain host provider right um
and so for me i use namecheap for all my domains

01:24
now sometimes uh namecheap doesn't have uh like the special tlds like the really
weird endings like not.com.org but like the weird ones and when i want a weird
one that namecheap doesn't have i use i want my name right so name cheap and i
want my name are pretty much what i use for all my domains you don't really look
anywhere else um i love namecheap uh an interesting and i do it for right now
like 70 of their employees are from ukraine and so right now they're getting
a lot of like namecheap is doing right by their
employees which i always love to see and so if you're interested in
supporting a company that employs ukrainians like that's just another value add
for namecheap right now cool articus hey thank you for the hydration

01:25
cheers to you what about godaddy no just know godaddy is a horrible company
with horrible support the most misogynistic commercials i've ever seen
like no just stop godaddy is the papa john's of the domain
world exactly godaddy is the papa john's of the uh domain world and normally i'm
pretty like i don't i don't like to make i don't like to say stuff like that on
stream but no they they deserve no just don't use godaddy namecheap is amazing i
want my name is amazing and just don't like this is like one of the things where
it's like just take my advice on these two please um there's so many other
domain providers that that are out there i've used them all like i've used a lot
of them and i just constantly come back to these two because it just they just
work they get out of your way they have great support a lot of the other domains
are kind of owned by like two or three big companies and so even if you think
like they're separate they're not namecheap is now kind of part of one of

01:26
those but yeah just just don't go you won't go wrong using these two cool
and none of these are like just to put out there none of these are like none of
these links are like scammy like none of these are like referral links or
anything like that like i would never use those without like yeah i would just
never use those so these are just like my actual opinions there's no like
referral link or anything happening there cool
all right so now we've talked about how to
set up your online presence you now have
a decent portfolio that's using a domain for free hosting for free templates for
free you set up a twitter that has a great intro that explains that you are a
software engineer not aspiring not junior you got rid of all that stuff
during the break and you have a linkedin that's just simple you're keeping it to
three things so that way all that stuff can start to marinate
right all stuff can start to marinate and when folks eventually look for you

01:27
online they find those things so now we're gonna talk about finding clients
this is the part where folks get a little a little scared a little a little a
little shooketh but it's not it's not wild i'm going to
give you a process uh that has worked for all of my students and we're going
to go through it together cool when you're looking for clients right start close
tell your friends tell your family and post on social media all your social
medias even if you gotta dust off the facebook and post for the first time in
three years put everything out there you will be surprised when you talk to
your friends that somebody from your your your third grade soccer team
there they now run a barber shop and they need a website right
tell your family you never know your brothers cousins uncles best friends

01:28
twice removed they they they're starting a new coffee company
and they need a new website the more you put out there to your
friends and your family and honestly explain to them what you do hey i'm a
software engineer i build websites and web applications for different clients
if you ever know someone that needs a website or web application send them my
way it's that simple but tell all your friends tell all your family
you will be surprised who comes out of the woodwork
to say oh i heard from so and so that you do websites or web applications i
need help right put it on your xanga put on your aim away message exactly
whatever whatever you got put it out there
right by telling your friends and family
you will be surprised i i say this every
single time i teach this class and i get all these messages leon somebody twice
removed from church his best friend's brother they they want me to build

01:29
something and they get the client so please tell your friends tell your
family and then share it on the social media that you have and you will be
surprised what comes to you that's the first place you're going to get clients
right now the next thing you want to start doing is going local
right all of you are networking locally right the idea is that
you try going local first and then if locals not
the bee's knees you go to the closest metro area
is the same thing for freelancing the being local
is the biggest advantage you will ever have when it comes to freelancing
we're going to talk about ways for folks that live in the middle of nowhere that
don't have a local area to to network with or to get clients from we're going
to talk about how to do that but you have to understand for folks

01:30
that do have the ability to be local that is your biggest
advantage and so you want to make sure that as you are networking you are
introducing yourself appropriately when you're going to these meetups
you're going to these events right and you introduce yourself you say hey i am
so and so i am a software engineer and i build websites and web applications for
clients in the and then you say wherever you're from so i would say hi i'm leon
i'm a software engineer i build websites and web applications for clients in the
la area i do that to every single person i meet southpaw said what
if i don't want my current employer to know we are doing this don't tell them
they don't know what meetups you're going to they don't know where you're
where you're going you might be a little bit safer on your social media um but
that's that's up to you i'm going to show you how to play the game and what's

01:31
up to you you want to play and how you're going to play it right
so um the the joke that people always give when i when i when i mention this
is that if you ever watch the office there's one character that does this
amazingly well it's bob vance bob vance vance refrigeration throughout
the entire show bob always introduces himself as bob
vance vance refrigeration you will never meet bob vance from vance's
refrigeration and not know what they do it seems funny
but it works every single person that has ever watched the office knows who's
bob vance is and they know what they do who like if you think about any other tv
characters do you know what their profession is like off the rip
this is like a secondary a minor character in a show and we all remember
what the profession is because that idea works and so when you're going to these
meetups bob's burgers exactly when you go to these meetups
it it sounds a little silly at first but hey i'm leon nice to meet you i'm a

01:32
software engineer i build websites and web applications for clients in the la
area uh how are you doing what do you what are you why did you come here
tonight right like it's it seems a little odd at first but the more you do
it the easier it becomes and then every single person you meet you build that
relationship with knows what the heck you do and you're local to start right
you're local to start and so as you're networking you're meeting
these folks locally start telling them what you do and maybe off the rip with
the the introductions a little bit hard but maybe try and let folks know
throughout the conversations now you've told your friends you've told
your families you've put it out there on social as you're networking you're
letting folks know what you do that's like how like 70 of my of my students
get clients like off the rip 70 friends family um
social media and networking that's like 70

01:33
of how folks get clients it just works right next is listings using local
listings so local listings are things like craigslist
facebook marketplace facebook groups next door your local chamber of commerce
right any of these places that are local now a lot of them are crap
like a lot of them just don't work or there's a lot of weird stuff that
happens on them but a lot of my students still get amazing clients heck i even
get amazing clients from things like craigslist like you you're like what
it's not gonna be your main vertical it's not gonna be the main way you get
clients but it's worth it to check once a week and to post once a week if you're
able that hey i'm a local software engineer you put in big bright letters i
am local i will meet you at and you insert the famous hot dog site i would

01:34
love to talk to you about your web development needs right remember remember
the the local thing is your shtick when folks are putting stuff on these
listings or putting it out there they're going to get inundated with like
hundreds of messages of folks that are not local you have to infuse the
localness in the way you talk the lingo that you use and the messages that you
send right so if you are talking to someone you say like hey i'm a local to
nashville let's go to this wonderful hot dog psych and talk about your project
right you got to infuse that locality to help you stand out we're going to talk
about other folks that are not local we're going to talk about in a second
but local is your value ad it is the thing that will help you stand out from
the onslaught of other folks that are reaching out on these listings now
you've done friends you've done family you've done social you've done told
every single person you've been networking with remember you're

01:35
networking every week you owe me three coffee chats i'm sorry three network
connections and two coffee chats a week that's a lot of folks that now know you
are a freelancer and it compounds the more you network
the more people that know the more people that are willing to
come your way you're now putting out on all these listings you're talking to
folks on facebook marketplace you're talking in facebook groups that are
local to you you're doing all these things you now have like a strong face
the next step is to talk to places that you know right the places that you go to
right your barber the nail salon the hair salon the
restaurants right look at the places that you know
is there something that they don't have about their web presence do they have a
web presence right help them right you know them you know they're
they're they're offering best talk to them

01:36
right a lot of my students first clients are their barbers a lot of my first
students are the restaurant that they've been going to since they were little
that doesn't have a website right now a lot of these local places
are hurting uh folks want digital when the when kovitt hit like the people went
digital and so if they haven't kept up with that wave they're missing out on a
lot of clients they're missing out on a lot of opportunities you could provide
them tremendous value by helping them modernize or making whatever they did
sign up with during the pandemic actually work better right
and so you've now told friends family you you've put on social you've been
networking and telling everyone you've done the listings you talk to the places
you know the next thing is to be outbound pick a niche and go for it so

01:37
uh when i used to teach in the classroom and rc
we would do we call it we call this process hustle week so they have you
have five weeks of instruction and then your six week we have off and all you do
is get a client right hundreds of folks in that week you've gotten a client
but every once in a while we have some students that struggle
and so one of the very first times i did this we had a small group of folks that
were struggling and so i said hey let's get a client together today and
that's what we did we did a three-step process that got us two
clients in one day let me say again two clients one day so in the morning
we picked a niche we said we're we were located in boston he said all right
what's that what's your niche what what what can we help folks with like who can
we provide value and what are there a lot of and so our answer was restaurants
we said all right well restaurants right now are having to modernize they're
having to go online they need digital menus they need ability for folks to

01:38
order right they're getting if they're competitors on uber and they're not
they're they're getting disrupted right and so we're like we could probably
provide a lot of value to restaurants and help them modernize and come online
and so we said all right we're gonna go at restaurants and for two hours
all me me and my students that were doing this process with me we compiled a
list of every single restaurant in boston it only took us like two hours to
put it up against all of us we found all the restaurants in boston and uh
mecca pre hey 609 thank you so much for the 10 gifts it subs that's wild
thank you so much thank you for being here appreciate you
all right we take we made a list of all the restaurants and so i'm going to
share a list of restaurants all this is public info but don't be like a weirdo
and start calling people or anything like that these are all restaurants that
um were in boston and we found them and we put we

01:39
found their their business name right and then we said do they have a website
and is it shitty i should probably need to change that uh
so we just we just found all these we found all these places and we split it
up by different people right so there's different different people for different
different restaurants right but we found all these restaurants we said do they
have a website and is it bad and then we dialed for dollars
right we said all right we have all these restaurants we found them all
we're gonna start calling and our goal is if they don't have a
website to get them a website and they have a bad website to get them a better
one right and so we we start dialing for dollars
and um you'll notice we kind of have like three different color combinations
uh red was uh they didn't answer or they
told us to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off they're just like don't ever call me again um
and then blue was like we couldn't talk to the
manager or something weird was happening and green was like they were interested

01:40
like they were like all right like like we left a message or like there was
something that we could probably reach back out to them again and so what
you'll notice is that like we're like half of them we told like like we got
rejected the other like third like nobody like it
just didn't we didn't work out and like a third was like people that were like
oh interesting tell me more nobody picks
up the phone anymore they're not getting called they're not getting calls and
they're not getting calls from people that are local remember local is an
advantage right and so we were like all right
i'm not some sales guru i've run sales teams in the past uh but these are some
folks that have never sold anything in their life so for folks that were not
charismatic that some people are saying charismatic
some folks that have never dialed for dollars before how did they do it well
i gave them a script and the script was super
simple it's not some some wild script that they had memorized where they were

01:41
elite sales teams no right it was a very simple script hi this is bob
do you have a website where i could see your menu that's what we say on the
phone hey do you have a website where i can see your menu
and then there is a decision tree if they said no right
uh if they like so they'd be like all right odd question um can we see your
menu right they say uh you like you have a menu and then now it's the kick kick
off the conversation right like hey do you have a menu that would get the
conversation going right and then i would say huh odd question but is the
business owner available so it didn't matter if they had a menu or they didn't
have a menu it didn't matter it was just to get them talking right then i would
say huh odd question is the business owner available right and you're like
business owner who says that right but then if they said no then i would
say hey what is their name and when are they normally around right and if they
asked why i would say oh i'm a boston-based web developer i make
websites and would love to help out a local business if they said yes i am the

01:42
owner we would say great i'm a boston-based web developer i make
websites and would love to help out a local business if they say yes they are
busy i'll say great i'll call back in a few minutes that was it
this was the simple script that we used i had what was it five or six students
dialing for dollars this is not some woof of wall street thing that like
folks are saying this was it this is this super simple simple decision tree and
there was two things that i held my students to right two things
you could only ever get off the phone if one of these two things happened one
they had to agree to a package of at least a hundred dollars
or two they had to hang up on you that was it that was the only outcome
for my students the person had to agree to a package
of at least a hundred dollars where we set up their website

01:43
or they had to hang up on us and we were calm
we were persistent but we weren't mean we weren't pressuring them we were
asking lots of great questions good qualifying deals right like we weren't
we weren't doing anything that would be like
like bad we just weren't getting off the phone until they agreed to a package or
they hung up on us right and we got hung up on a lot but we were calm we were
cool we were collected we were professional we were nice the whole time
we were trying to joke and have fun with them
right and they would either hang up or they agree and so my students did this
for all the restaurants that you just saw and at the end of the day we had two
clients and the clients weren't for a hundred dollars we had a client for i
think it was like 500 and 800 right and we yeah so we were like what's
inside we called this company instadyne.tech it's not up anymore but
it was for a while we built a really quick landing page using a template and
when people asked us who we were we would say oh we're instadying.tech we're

01:44
a local agency that helps restaurants like yours and that's it for dollars has
short and simple script and by the end of that day we had two clients so
you can start with friends you can start with family you can start with your
social you can as you're networking letting folks know you can be local
using your listings and that doesn't work you can always dial for dollars it
does work now i showed you how i created a list
i gave you my script the call folks it works
you're going to get hung up on a lot you're going to uh get
rejected over and over and over again but uh in the end

01:45
it works and some folks go really deep into the sales world they watch the
video i asked you to watch today called
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you pay me and they start to really
like the sales process and they get better at this outbound
uh outbound exactly is a numbers game it's not
the game i really play anymore i have a lot of inbound now but i did a lot of
networking to get that inbound coming in so it's kind of a personal preference
which way you go about it inbound outbound some people prefer
some some folks really hate the networking piece so they'd rather just
talk to a thousand strangers that's just what they like to do right it's up to
you cat hey thank you for the hydration cheers to you
alrighty what if getting away from cold calling is one of the reasons i like the
sound of web development well good you don't have to cold call to uh to get

01:46
clients i don't code call cold call anymore ever to get clients mine's all
inbound um but i'm just showing different strokes for different folks
right like some folks like the dialing for dollars some folks really like the
networking some folks prefer just to keep it friends family and social it's
up to you alrighty last in this realm of finding clients
is going wide so you've done the local game you've done everything you can
locally the next thing is going wide so there are kind of three big things when
it comes to going wide and this is also the advice for folks that are not
they don't have a local area to invest in right they're maybe not close to a
metro area local is not a thing for them and so they have to start going wide

01:47
one of the first places that folks start off by going wide are gig sites they'll
go to upwork or fiverr or freelance like all these gig sites now
gig sites are really really hard because you're competing against a lot of folks
and so if you're going to use gig sites you have to do two things i've had
hundreds of students try using gig sites the only ones that ever see be really
successful do two things one they invest heavily and making sure
that their presence on that gig site is all up to par they get all the all of
the like accoutrements you can put on your profile everything
and then the second thing is they price everything really high right when you
use these gig sites there it's a term i don't like to use but it's the truth
it's a race to the bottom right it's a race to the bottom right it's it's
it's this idea that there's so many people competing and they're all just

01:48
racing they give the cheapest price because they think
they think competing on price is the thing to do
never ever ever compete on price it doesn't help you land good clients the
clients that are that price sensitive are not the clients you want to work
with if you go on these gig sites and you price higher folks see that and they
go huh they must be providing a lot of value to price it at a thousand when
everyone else is pricing it at a hundred right and so the folks that did gig gig
sites the only way that it's ever worked is by having a really tricked out
profile and then also valuing high but otherwise i stay away from the gig
sites i've tried them all it's just not the best time investment
there's a better time investment and that's building authority right
folks that build authority can get around a lot so what do i mean by that
pick a niche right pick a niche if you are

01:49
in an area where there is no localness you are fully remote you'll never have a
metro area near you where you can do this in
or you're in an area some folks like to think that certain areas are saturated
there rarely are but for some reason you think maybe local can't work for you
the best strategy i have seen for folks to get clients when they don't have a
local area to to balance off of is to build authority around a niche so you
pick something and you become the expert at that thing
it could be restaurants it could be barber shops it could be nail salons it
could be something where you know that industry inside and out and you build a
presence around that niche i've done this before with dental offices
i built up a whole agency that just worked with dentists
it was great dentists are horrible clients to work with but i had an

01:50
amazing blog i had a lot of content when i would talk to dentists they would see
that i was the authority on how to get clients to come into dental offices how
to build their web presence right and so they would pick me over all the
other folks that were talking to them because i built up authority you can do
this i don't care if you live in the middle of nowhere have no network you
start today you pick your niche you build a blog you build authority you put
out content right right you put out content and you
slowly build up that train of content and then you build out a list of folks
that are in that niche and you reach out to them right it takes a long time
but it's a way to get through it um you can start a blog tonight node former
sponsor of the of the stream completely free to start a blog sam has an amazing

01:51
blog that they started that helped them build authority in the freelancing world
right in the freelancing world and so yeah exclamation excitation point hash
note thank you and different um you can start a blog tonight and so for
folks that can't go local building authority is the way to go
this would seem like a long-term investment it is you're talking about
building a niche and becoming the expert
in it so that you can serve your clients best awesome all right now
the next thing we're going to talk about is we've built up our online presence
we're either going local or building authority now we we have found a client
and we start the conversations with those clients
now it's time to build our proposal like what are we sending to them what are we

01:52
negotiating with them how are we getting them to pay us like how do we do the
pricing how do we how do we know like what to charge them
well that's what we're going to talk about next
but before we do so we're going to take a break
so let's bring our five minutes up here when we come back from five minutes
we're gonna talk about how do you price effectively like how do you like
actually figure out how much you're gonna charge someone right we're gonna
talk about the proposal you send to them once you agree on what's going to be
built i'm going to show you real actual proposal templates you can
use starting today i'm going to show you
real contracts that you can use starting today we're going to
paint a beautiful picture we're going to
walk through all that stuff together and then we're going to take probably about
30 minutes to answer all your questions you might have about freelancing
if you haven't already submit your questions to the slido
and upload the questions you want to see answered during the question and answer
period alrighty folks uh let's start the timer

01:53
if you're able to please get up move around hydrate uh let your eyes focus on
something that's not the screen and we'll be back in five
i'm gonna run ads because we we should be running ads

01:56
so folks don't get cut off during stream all right cn5 folks tinker said

01:57
i have a co-worker that i'm friendly with there's a youtube channel but no
dedicated website do they count uh yeah those count just like no like like not
your best friend or your family like you want to push yourself to try this stuff
folks won't see ads if they have a sub some folks asking
spell i use a shure sm7b how many paid clients will you have by
the end of this cohort it's up to you the requirements at least one
is paypal okay for taking payment uh it can be if that's the way that works best
for you but um check is also good paypal is weird because then you have to worry
about like chargebacks and stuff like that all right folks
drinking some cold brew tonight yeah a lot of folks will use zell or
check or some sort of wire stripe there are there are a bunch of platforms that

01:58
you can use all right folks come on through come on through
can you get a signed contract over email yeah and there are plenty of platforms
that do contracts now to like docusign and stuff like that
not shuffling paper anymore these days really especially with the pandemic
all right so talk about a lot of ways to one build our presence and two to um
start finding clients and it's a process at first finding clients is very hard
but it's something you tackle one at a time you tackle building your presence
you tackle talking to friends and family then you talk tackle trying to do it
while you're networking like it's pieces that you build up over time right but

01:59
the thing is you can do it i've had hundreds of students do it from all
walks of life it feels really uncomfortable at first
but you have the skills you have the ability
you will be able to do it and if you get
stuck or have questions or you're trying
to find ways to make it work for you ask lots of questions uh especially this
coming weeks on discord try and figure out something that's
going to work for you and then like i said if there's things that are actual
barriers to you doing this process we're going to decide
things that you can do either volunteering
working on open source projects things like that cool
alrighty so we've used some of these channels to maybe get a client we're
starting to talk to them we are going to want to send them a
proposal so what the heck is a proposal a proposal is kind of like a simple walk
through of what you are going to provide right
you are going to come to an agreement on what they need and what you can provide

02:00
that satisfies those needs and then you're going to send them a proposal
that details everything that's going to be delivered
to them in the end and we're going to talk about like how to come to that
agreement we're gonna talk about like how to figure out what the charge for
that but for now let's just get that proposal idea in our brain so we can
explain that in a second or two so there are two really great proposal
uh templates that i recommend and that's
proposify and hand a doc uh they're both completely free
and you can click through and look at them i think we might give them the hug
of death uh so here's the proposifier that i linked to
and it's just a really good template you can see it's an overview of goals the
scope of services additional recommendations and a bunch of other
stuff time frame all that stuff goes in here so i actually recommend right

02:01
i actually recommend combining this proposify and this panda doc one together
right like there's there's two different ways about going through it
but you kind of take what you want from each of them but
completely ready to go proposals you don't have to pay somebody else you
don't define them they're completely free this is what you're going to use
it's going to break down like what you're going to do and what you're going
to send to the client in the end that's what a proposal is right
the other thing folks kind of um worry about our contracts we're going to get
that into a second so here is a real example from one of my
past students that's now at amazon i have their permission to share this with
you all and so here's like what their proposal
looked like that they sent to a client uh design logo for the organization uh
ibrahim has agreed that the client will be able to request multiple edits of the
logo design estimate for the logo design was 300
the final website development in qa would be 700 and the total estimate
would be a thousand dollars when the website is completed the client agrees

02:02
to pay a hundred dollars monthly that keeps the website functional and updated
occasionally the client can end this agreement anytime if they feel there's
no longer need for the service any longer so this is just a real example
of a simple piece of a proposal that has actually
wound up paying one of my students a thousand dollars
and uh they actually worked in a retainer uh some students really like
the idea of a retainer having that monthly coming in and so the retainer is
something that i no longer do but i used
to do a lot and the idea is that you can charge clients
maybe one billable hour a month where they know that each month they get at
least an hour of your time and you have that recurring money coming in so a lot
of folks like to do that a lot of my students do it
i don't do that anymore just because i didn't want to be on the hook for it i
don't want calls at like three o'clock in the morning to bring people's sights
back up and i didn't feel like i was providing enough value or that time i

02:03
feel like i i felt like i was kind of tricking them right like
they signed up maybe they used it for the first month and they just forgot
about it and for me business relationships are always about providing
value both ways and if i'm not providing value i don't feel comfortable with it
so i stopped you know but this is a real world example
definitely give ibrahim a follow just because people are don't share their
contracts people won't share their proposals but this is like a real world
example where they broke it down uh also creating
logos and stuff like that is pretty easy namecheap has a free logo maker that's
really easy to create logos i love it namecheap is amazing i love their logo
maker brand is 100 devs create a free logo all right let's create our our logo
uh with the namecheap logo maker left middle or right chat left l m or r lmr

02:04
all right we got m l m or r left middle or right
oh this one's close you are going m again l m or r
if people are getting caught up in the slow mode too well a lot a lot of l's
here cool l m or r definitely l ah middle yeah i think still the l l m or r
well r has got it this time you want the thick boys and definitely a m again
cool color i was going to pick blue blue green purple red brown or orange

02:05
throw it in chat blue purple red i think the the blues or greens have it uh
i'm gonna go oh purple came through too green green has it all right we go get
cool uh favorite icon let's do like computer search for computers
nah search for code oh it's fancy i like that one uh i like that one
maybe the thicker or that one too there we go
uh maybe not this one maybe maybe the that one
cool all right let's continue with those three icons there we go all right
so now there's like a bazillion different logos that you can choose from

02:06
everyone you like the most you all picked horrible fonts
y'all picked horrible thoughts uh oh i like this one this one's clean
there we go and there we go look looks good on the
business card it's good on the t-shirt merch coming soon folks look at that
beautiful and then you can just download it and there you go super easy
throw that in your proposal you're off to the to the races that'll be 300 please
cool so proposals you can use either one of
these examples or combine them i like combining them uh this is a real world
example and then the last kind of piece here is the the contract before we talk
about like how to price and how to send the proposal okay so contracts are
something that kind of gets a lot of folks kind of uneasy uh they
they they don't know like what a contract really is they get they get

02:07
nervous about it but contracts shouldn't make you feel uneasy um they shouldn't
be scary contracts are simply there to protect both parties
right so a contract should be a two-way thing it shouldn't be in favor it
shouldn't favor one person more than the other it's actually like not a good
contract and might not hold up remember i'm not a lawyer now this is legal
advice but for me a contract is really important
because it just says what happens when something goes wrong
and as you are freelancing stuff will go wrong
you will send out shitty proposals your proposals get better with time
you will agree to things that maybe you shouldn't have agreed to you will take
on clients that pay you too little and ask for too much
right like freelancing is hard it takes a while to get good at freelancing right

02:08
and so uh a contract is really just there to make sure the parties know what
happens when things go wrong not that things will go wrong but if they do you
both know how things are going to shake
out the video i had you watch the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
you pay me video is all about this it's just about like why contracts are good
why they help both parties and why you should always use one now i actually
start off with friends families you definitely need contracts even if my
mom's getting a contract right i don't care who you are you're getting a
contract and you're getting a proposal because contracts are there just to help
both parties and to say what happens when things don't go right
the closer you are to somebody the more you want to contract because you want
that relationship to be good and for both parties to agree to what happens
before things go wrong right right you you want a contract just so
that you know what happens when things go wrong and to have thought thought

02:09
about those things and talk through them together before something happens
it's not about trust it's not about um having to to to
enter into litigation or anything like that it's just so that when things don't
happen the way that you expected them to happen you know what the next steps are
and that just eases the process for everyone
has nothing to do with like those other pieces it's all about everyone coming
into an agreement as to how you're going to treat the relationship cool
i like to use the contract killer uh it is a completely free contract uh that
you can use right um that has all this stuff spelled out
right it has all this stuff spelled out you tell a story of a sign something
went wrong i like i told you in the beginning anything you could mess up
i've messed up i have done it all i'll talk about it i'll talk about that

02:10
in a second let me let me talk about the contracts and i'll talk about the time
things went wrong all right i like contract templates to start right
after you get your first client then you upgrade so there are two contract
templates that i really like uh the first is the contract killer template uh
you can click on it it's on github and they also have their own website and
it's a full breakdown of everything that you need to put into your contract for
when you're working right when you're working with a client it's all here it's
everything you need not to worry about anything else there's maybe like two
additions that i would make sure that are also in here um but it's a really
great place to start for your contract you don't have to
worry about figuring out something else you can use this and be off the to the
races uh this is really cool i really like the people that did this if you get
your first client and you use their contract they have like a way to donate
to them i would donate if you get a thousand dollar client and you use their

02:11
contract give them a donation that's worth it to me um but our one of our
fearless alumni that we always talk about sam
they actually took this contract killer and they changed some of the language so
contract killer is made by people in the
uk so there's some spelling there's some like words that we might not use in the
us so sam went through it and actually changed the wording so that it matched
what we might say in the us and so there's a second link here to like sam's
updates and i definitely highly recommend that as well right so
depending on where you're coming from or which one you want to use they're both
there so now you've have an online presence you've figured out some ways to
find some clients you have a way to create good proposals you have a good
way to write a decent contract uh there are some important bits that i
want you to have in the contracts before we talk about like sealing the deal and

02:12
closing the opportunity right the two big things that you must have in every
single contract are the two paragraphs here
never ever agree to do any work without these two
things in place the first thing is an indemnification clause the
identification clause says hey we're writing code
things can and will go wrong because it's code it's never going to be
perfect and what this means is if the code that i write that's something that
causes you to lose money or to incur some damages in any way shape or
form it's not my fault that's the risk that you're agreeing to when you work
with me and we write code that may not be perfect right so
let's say you you went down the restaurant niche
right you went down the restaurant niche and you build out a restaurant website
that has um online ordering and that online ordering platform messes up

02:13
and they drop they drop a couple orders right so maybe they drop a couple
hundred dollars worth of orders that indemnification clause saves it from
being your fault right so you don't ever want to do work
without that first paragraph in line because it stops them from coming after
you well it's not going to stop them coming after you but it stops it from
being on your end right so always have an indefinition clause and then the
second piece is kind of what happens and who owns the code that you write
and so this this clause here talks about giving a
i'm just going to read it and then i'll explain what it means
we'll own any intellectual property rights we've developed prior to or
developed separately from this project and not paid for by you
we'll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a
complete design and will license it to you once paid in full

02:14
exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only unless we agree
otherwise so what this means is that you don't own any of the other work that
i've done you only owe the you only own the work that i've done for you and
technically right technically you don't actually own the work i do
i am giving you a license to this content that is exclusive and in
perpetuity and for this project only now why do you think we do this why do we
do this but give them a license an exclusive license why do we do that
for our portfolios exactly we still own it all so we can still
highlight it demo it on our portfolio and if we're freelancing

02:15
there are probably pieces of our code that we're going to reuse over and over
and over again in other projects so if we don't own our code we can't reuse it
in other projects that doesn't make sense we did we did all this work we
can't put on our portfolio that doesn't make sense so we do our work
and we give them an exclusive perpetual license to it so we can still be able to
do the work that we do right now the other big piece here was once paid in
full amazing movie um they do not get this license right
until they have paid us in full right and so they might have seen the
work they might have been playing with the work but they do not have any claim
to it until we have all of our monies when you enter into an agreement
to work with someone i always recommend you get a deposit

02:16
i only do work with 50 up front i will never work with you unless you
pay me a 50 deposit up front i do that 50 of the work right you're
happy with it then you pay another 25 up front i work you feel happy with it
i finish that last bit and i am paid in full and
once i am paid in full i transfer things onto your server
you will never have access to the code it'll never be on your servers you will
not have your license to it until i am paid in full
is the deposit refundable absolutely not because you're paying me to do the work
i don't want to get halfway through a project and then you no longer want to
do it i only do work that i have been paid for
i only do work that i've been paid for so i'm going to do 50 of the work
because you've paid me 50 up front you're going to pay me the next trunk

02:17
i'm going to do that work you're going to pay me in full and i'll finish it out
all right and so that's how i save myself from getting getting burned ask me why
ask me why i do it that way somebody asked me why i do it that way yes why
because i have been stiffed plenty of times i have not gotten paid i have been
burned i've been people have tried to pay me less anything that could happen
has happened and so i get a deposit right and in fact actually my very first
project i got a deposit right i knew i knew enough to ask for a deposit up
front that's how i bought my pasta and pasta sauce so i've been burnt anyway
you can be burnt so get a deposit only work for work that has been paid for now
when folks are first starting out it's harder to ask for like 50 up front but
something in good faith is always worthwhile asking for 10 25
right you want to make sure that they have skin in the game too it doesn't

02:18
make sense to do all this work for them to just not pay you in the end right
so don't get got make sure you have these two important bits in your contract
and then the last thing i want to talk about is how to close
you have an online presence right you have an online presence
you start to reach out to you start to reach out to clients
clients are reaching out to you you're building out proposals that have
all the highlights of what you're going to build for them you are sending out
good contracts the last thing i want to talk about is how to close and
how i close comes down to one magical question i love being on the phone
for me whenever i'm working with a client it's always on the phone
and i do one thing on the phone and one thing only

02:19
tell me about your project that's it there's not some amazing speech i give them
not anything that's that's wild i just say hey it sounds like you have a really
interesting idea tell me everything about your project
and i let them talk they'll talk for 30 minutes 40 minutes an hour sometimes if
i give them the time and i'm taking really good notes
everything their dreams their wishes their hopes their desires their third
grade crush everything they could ever want in this
project i'm listening okay amazing i'm digging a little bit deeper tell me a
bit more you said you want this thing tell me a little bit more about that
thing right i just let them go off on the largest
tangent ever about everything they could ever want to be in this project right
and then at the end i say wow this sounds like an amazing project

02:20
there's a lot here what is your ballpark budget and some folks go
how dare you ask me about money what do you think i am right and you go wait a
minute there's a lot here we just talked for 30 minutes about all the bells and
whistles and everything that you want i need to know what budget you're working
with to build all of this stuff because here's what i want to do for you
i want to build you a proposal that highlights everything i can get done at
that budget now i could build a proposal for a thousand dollars sorry i would
never say a thousand dollars i would say i could build a proposal for ten
thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars i could put a proposal for one
million dollars that doesn't help us if we're not in the same ballpark i don't
have that time to build out all these different proposals at all these
different price points so what is your ballpark budget
it doesn't have to be exact like where what are we talking about we talking

02:21
about a thousand five thousand ten thousand right
and then they'll give you the budget sometimes they'll say i actually what is
your hourly rate no no i don't do hourly rate i need to know what your ballpark
budget so i i know where we're at least talking about and i'll tell you
everything i can get done at that budget you gave me a huge laundry list i'm
going to tell you exactly what i can get done off this list that i think is the
most impactful and i'm going to get it done at your budget
right so i never give them an hourly rate and i'll have i'll keep saying this
over and over again and 99 of the time they'll eventually give
me the ballpark budget uh skipping hourly rate is really important
because hourly rate does nothing there is uh an amazing youtube channel
called the future which is about building an agency and
they have something that i there's this one talk that i really love and they
talk about hourly rate and so the hourly rate punishes me

02:22
right it punishes me christo exactly that's their name christo
um punishes me for being good at my job right because if i take more time right
if i take more time you pay me more money
but i'm not going to take that time i'm good at my job so i'm going to do less
time but you're going to get a better product so you're actually punishing me
for being good at my job that doesn't make sense so how about you
give me your ballpark budget i let you know
what i can get done at that budget and if we agree great if not i'm going to
connect you with three other freelancers that might be able to do more for you
right at that price point so i would love to build you a wonderful
proposal that takes in everything that we just talked about at your budget that
i think would be a huge win for you and your business but if it doesn't work out
that's okay i'll connect you with some folks that i know are really great

02:23
friends that won't steer you wrong that's it
that's it they give you the ballpark budget and then you build them a
phenomenal proposal that takes into account all the things
you wrote down about what they want that
you think you can get done at that price point and you're doing the back of the
the menu like the back of the the back of the napkin numbers and your brain be
like all right i think it's going to take me this amount of time so this is
how much i can get done right but you you do that on your end
right you think about all right if the ballpark budget is 5 dollars what can i
get done for them at that five thousand dollars that leaves me the things i need
left right you're gonna need to think through that that like all right
i think it's going to take me this number of hours i want to make this
amount of money per hour right you do that all yourself you're not ever going
to share that with them but you're trying to figure out all right what can

02:24
i build at that price point all right when you're talking to clients there's a
couple big things you need to keep in mind the what is your ballpark budget is
the magic question but when you're talking with clients i need to do a few
things you need to be firm right not mean not pushy but firm right
don't let someone try and convince you to take less money or to do more work
those clients never work out be firm of what you can get
done at what price point and that means you're going to lose some clients
but that is always a good thing losing a client is the best thing that
could ever happen because if it's starting off like trouble
it's going to be trouble and it's going to end with trouble right so be firm
be clear in what you can get done and what you can provide and what you can do
and then there's two things that you must always live up to as a freelancer

02:25
under promise and then over deliver right
under promise the things that you can do and then
exceed their wildest expectations right the other thing that you have to do as
you're negotiating or figuring out what's going to go into the proposal is
that you have to leave room to get help both in time and money every contract i
have ever worked on i take how long i think it's going to
take me to finish and i double it if i think it's going to take me a month
i say two months if i think it's gonna take me two months i say four if i think
it's gonna be three i say six i leave myself enough room that if i get
in trouble i can get help this is the biggest thing you have to do for your
first freelancing client because you might run into some trouble and you're
going to need to get help right so i always leave room in my timeline to get

02:26
help from other folks and i always leave
room in my budget to get help from other engineers
a lot of times there might be problems that i can't solve on my own and i'll
need to bring in some other engineer to help me with that problem so i always
leave room my budget for that to happen if i really do feel like i can really
crush the project and i don't think i would have any trouble i still leave
room for something odd to come up maybe there's some like weird bit of
functionality that i don't feel comfortable building out and i'll bring
someone else on right a lot of times with higher paid clients
i'm upfront with it hey i'm really good at talking with clients
making sure that you're getting the best value like best value out of this
relationship possible but i work with a team of other engineers they're going to
help me get some of the work done right and so always leave room for time and
always leave room for money get a deposit we already talked about this

02:27
in the beginning your deposits might be lower and then you'll build up to
getting at least a 50 deposit and then it's time to deliver the goods right
delivering the goods comes down to a few
things remember when we're delivering on the project we've we've done all the
hard work we built out our we built out our presents we've done the
work to get the client in the door uh we've given them a monster proposal
we've given them a monster contract they're super happy with the value that
we're going to provide at the price point that we feel
comfortable doing it we left ourselves room in both time and money now it's
time to deliver the goods when it comes to delivering
the goods remember always under promise always over deliver and always
communicate regularly people that communicate regularly can get away with

02:28
anything they want when working with a client if you are
if you are communicating regularly you can get away with being
a little short on time you can get away with sometimes asking for more money
the most common thing that happens with folks when they hire or work with
another freelancer is that they get ghosted or they don't really know what's
happening every friday send your client an email
here's what we got done here's where we're gonna go this is where we're at
every friday every friday my clients get an email i don't care if i got nothing
done that week or if i got everything done this week they have to know that
consistently i'm not going to leave them
in the dark i'm going to communicate and they're always going to know where we
stand this will help you get out of so much
hot water when you need an extra week they're going to give it to you every
single time because they never had to guess where you were

02:29
if you're a little over budget on something they'll at least come back to
the table right so i like to make sure every friday my
clients get an email i actually schedule them
and then i add more stuff to them as the week goes on and then i actually ping
them on wednesdays too so on wednesday i'll be like oh we just did this really
cool thing right so wednesday to get a message that says
i hope you're doing well today like we just did this really cool thing this
feature's live look at it on the test server whatever and then friday is like
the formal update here's everything we did the week
at the end that's why my clients come back right time and time again my clients
have come back because they value that communication and how
quick i am with it and how much detail i give right a lot of folks hold stuff
back they're afraid to give the full picture no i don't care if it's good i
don't care if it's bad you're going to get you're going to always know where i
stand and that takes a lot of weight off their
shoulders it gives them a lot of relief and they'll come back for that

02:30
and so that kind of leads me to this idea of of kind of coming back
there's one other step here and then we talk about this idea of coming back uh
get help when you need it right you're communicating regularly there might be
start to realize wait i'm not gonna hit this deadline i'm not gonna be able to
figure this thing out get help you've left enough room to get help you left
enough room to figure things out get help come to discord i don't know how to
solve this problem right there'll be so many people that are ready ready to help
you even with your client work there will be so many folks that maybe you can
bring on board to help with the project right and so get help right get help
don't suffer in silence make sure you get help especially when working with
clients right so many folks from 100 devs last cohort
came to discord when they were working on their client projects to talk through
details to figure things out to ask for recommendations about how to solve
problems that's what we're here for make sure you ask for help even with client

02:31
work cool last thing is reinvest all this stuff is going to suck at first
your proposals are going to suck your contracts are going to suck your your
portfolio site's going to suck it just is because we're we're using stuff off
the shelf we're doing it just to to get stuff done we're bad as we write bad
code right but as you get that first client in take that money to reinvest
and and if you have the privilege to reinvest right if you have the privilege
to reinvest use that to bolster everything now
i talked about this idea before we get into the investment about like clients
coming back and why that's so important uh i've had years
where my income has relied on freelancing if i'd if i wasn't
freelancing i wouldn't have had any money in some of the years that i've
been doing this right when things got tough i knew i could freelance to bring
money in the door i've had years where i have freelanced
my freelancing has brought in more money than my day job

02:32
right and so this could be a really powerful thing
but what i don't want folks to think is that it's easy
it is very hard to freelance it is very hard to go out on your own
right and have the the amount of clients
it takes to sustain your salary right so
many folks think oh i'm going to quit my job i'm going to freelance and that's
going to be it no freelancing is the most stressful thing you will ever do if
that's what you rely on if you don't have an emergency fund right
if you don't have an emergency fund and you go a month without a client that
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] will will devastate you i the the lowest lows i've had
are when i was freelancing and didn't have enough money in the bank to like
tie me through to the next client so when folks are thinking about this i
need you to keep in mind that freelancing is something that at first
is supplemental and you can build up to it and eventually the way most

02:33
freelancers make their money is through repeat clients
i looked at my my contracting from the past couple years 50
of my freelancing income came from one client 50
came from one client that came back continuously time after time we call
these evergreen clients it's really hard to find an evergreen client but it's
what makes up most freelancers money they have some clients that just come
back with work time and time again and they come back to me
right because i get what they need to get done at a good budget
i communicate my ass off and they're never left in the dark about what the
heck's going on so they give me all their business
i say that to highlight that all the other freelancers that i know that
freelance full-time they either have an amazing network or
they have a few of those evergreen clients that they can rely on and they
have a war chest like six months of expenses fully ready rocked and rolled

02:34
that's not touching anything else so that if they get through a slump where
they're not getting any new clients they're good to go so i say that
because if your goal is to just do freelancing you're in for a really wild
ride do i have lots of friends that do it yes do they love it some of them do
some of them hate it but just know that you need to
build up to it right all these things we
talked about tonight are not easy and at first they're going to be kind of
they're going to be pretty hard and not really that great all right
after your first client if you have the privilege reinvesting those monies can
be put to really good use right you can be uh can be put to put the good
use right you can build a better portfolio you can build a
better proposal you can build a better contract you might want to set up a
business entity you might want to bring in a lawyer to look at your proposals to
look at your contracts you might need a cpa or a bookkeeper to handle all the

02:35
inbound stuff that you're coming in right and so after your first client if
you have the privilege do things the right way right i showed you the freeway
that's good enough to get started once you have monies coming in
maybe and reinvest if you have the privilege in doing things a little bit better
right right and so a lot of folks ask me leon do i need a
business entity do i need an llc not in the beginning
llcs limited liability corporations what they do is they help protect you from
your assets if you don't have any assets you don't need an llc
nobody's coming after your bubble gum collection right so if you don't have a
house or expensive car or things like that nobody's coming after you for for
nothing right so you don't need an llc an llc is just there to protect you
like your business from your assets right so a lot of people like come out
the gate with an llc you know like you just wasted five ten grand setting all

02:36
that up um because you used the lawyer to do it when you could have just went
through the like state's way of doing it which would have cost
you way like a tenth of that right um so just be careful
the the first the first run through this
your first few clients give you the cash flow if you have the privilege to use
that then you reinvest in all this other stuff yeah
yeah llc's don't cost 5 10k you can normally if you're in the us each state
has a different process anywhere from like 50 bucks to i think west california
now like 5 800 like each each state's different right or you can use like one
of those services to help you set it up but in the beginning you don't need any
of that get some clients coming in the door and then reinvest those monies and
things that you might need to do the right way cool and once again i'm not a tax
professional i'm not a lawyer all this is just ramblings of things that i've
learned on my journey through this right back at it hey thank you for the

02:37
hydration cheers to you alrighty so we talked a lot tonight folks
we talked about we talked about building our online
presence i gave you some good examples that i hope you go back to look at their
portfolios look at their twitters look at their linkedins copy everything right
was it good artist copy great artist steal right the reason i gave you all
these things is that you can go back and
use them look at them make them your own look at their twitters looked at their
linkedins then we talked about how to get clients
think about what strategy you're going to use first you're going to talk to
friends family you're going to put it on all your social you're going to talk
about it when you do your networking this week maybe you're going to dabble
in some doing some local postings maybe you're
going to dabble in a little bit of cold calling whatever you need to do think
through some things get the ball rolling at first it's hard it feels weird it

02:38
feels awkward it feels uncomfortable but it gets easier with time
all right then we looked at some proposals you could go you're going to
go back look at those proposals you're going to see oh that's they laid out
that's how they do a timeline that's how they break down the design and all that
stuff right then you can look at the contract oh that's what the contractor
said there's too much detail for us to cover it in one class you got to go back
and look at it right then we talked about how to close how to seal the deal the
magic question what's your ballpark budget we talked about how to price
don't price hourly price based on their ballpark budget provide them a proposal
at that level where you can get done at that level
and then in the end we talked about how to reinvest right you got some money's
coming in if you have the privilege we use them the everything set up cool
so we got about 20 minutes left and i i promised that i would save it for
questions so you can use the slido link at slido.com use exclamation point ask

02:39
here in in discord sorry discord in twitch chat and you'll get the link
and i'm gonna go through the questions cause i know there's a lot of questions
about this uh we're gonna have a couple of our office hour sessions where we
just spend time on this freelancing stuff right so i know there's a lot here
and there's a lot of other questions you might have and so
we'll have time where we talk about this again right this is not our only class
where we talk about freelancing we're going to incorporate a lot of this stuff
into our homework it's not that's going to come up in classes over and over but
let's go ahead and take a look at some of these questions then we'll end with a
raid all right first question remember you can upload
the questions that you care about how do we handle hosting for a website
for a client you use netlify right you open up netlify you drag it in and
you're done well let's see if i can make sure let me see real quick that
will find accounts drop all right here we go

02:40
so here's netlify.com drop you literally drag a folder onto this location and
you're done so i would typically ask my client to set up a netlify account
uh they'll share their credentials with me in something like lastpass or i don't
know one password any of the password managers they'll share it with me
and then i will take a folder so let's um let's look at bachelor code from last
class all right here we go here's my bachelor code number one
i'm just going to drag the folder here it's uploading
and then boom here you go the site is live
that's the link you can change this link to be whatever you want and we're good
now bit warden exactly any of those password
magic doesn't matter whatever whatever you use um and then you can change that
link if you want so a lot of times uh it's on their account i don't use my
account i make them set up their own stuff sometimes when i'm ready when i'm

02:41
ready to host it for them remember i'm always working on my server right on my
netlify until they've paid me in full and then i go and do this on their server
right that's it and so you saw me do it in three seconds
i literally just dragged it over we can go ahead and change this url if we want
so uh normally i'll set one up where it is like the client's name at netlify on
my account show it once they pay me in full i do the same thing for their
account we're done and dusted now if you're doing full stack web applications of
course hosting is a little bit different we're not there yet cool next question
hi leon how are we supposed to deliver a website for a client don't we need to
know quite a bit about hosting databases back in in general no

02:42
most of your clients at first will just be static sites uh just like
just basic stuff html css a little bit of javascript you're gonna be using
templates for most of this stuff that's it
right and so you won't really need any anything else you won't need databases
or things like that once we get further into the cohort and you learn how to do
back-end web development then yes then you'll need some other things but by at
that point you'll know how to do all those things as well
should we use other hosts not really the other hosts are more complicated they
don't give you as many features and they're not free all of them so i really
do like netlify for this like simple stuff yeah do they give you passwords no we
use a password manager so i'll get them set up with any of the normal password
managers bitwarden lastpass one password they'll put all your they'll create
their accounts they'll put their passwords in there and they can share
them with me when it comes time to transfer stuff remember everything's
done on my servers until i'm ready to to put it on their servers and that's when
we ask for all the passwords and stuff what about github the host yeah that's

02:43
fine how many sets can we deploy on netlife i don't know if there's a max it's a
lot what do you recommend for getting paid
like an invoicing system that's kind of your personal preference
checks zell is typically the way to go i've even done like cash app and venmo
with some more hipper clients eventually once you have a lot of
freelancing work coming in you'll use a bigger platform to do your freelancing a
lot of folks use like fresh books or xero or quickbooks or things like that
but in the beginning you don't need any of that stuff you don't need to pay for
any of that stuff you can just ask for a check or a zell transfer or something
like that yeah and you send them an invoice you send them an invoice yeah
there's a you can just google invoice generator and that's what i've used for
pretty much all my invoices what kind of work should we avoid uh

02:44
that's up to you i think anything that makes you feel uncomfortable just don't
do if the client's asking for too much and too little time if the client's
asking for too much with too little money you just gotta let those clients
go it should be a good you should feel good going into an arrangement if you
ever feel like it has it isn't going well like the contract didn't go well
the proposal didn't go well it's time to stop and let that client go it's you
should both feel happy you should both feel like you're both getting value
right the clients you feel like they're getting a tremendous amount of value
you should feel like you're getting a tremendous amount of time and money for
your your services right if you're under 18 can you land a
freelancing gig yeah i've had a lot of folks under 18 get get jobs as
freelancers anonymous that i love you all right

02:45
should we include monthly maintenance in our contract or is it more a headache
than it's worth that is a huge decision that you will have to make for yourself
a lot of my students love maintenance contracts
i personally used to do them a lot i don't do them anymore i really want i
realize that my clients come back because i provide a lot of value
you might be providing a lot of value with that maintenance contract if you're
not providing value then i wouldn't do it i i don't like maintenance contracts
cause some folks kind of like sucker people into them or like they don't they
feel like oh i'm not going to do any work and i still get money each month i
think that's the wrong way to go about your freelancing the way that my
freelancing has always grown is because people have been always well not always
like i've had some stuff go bad right but by and far most folks have been like
leon was great to work with and they tell other people that's how your
freelancing grows right and so i i if i don't if i'm not giving a lot of value i

02:46
don't want to do it what's an example of maintenance you
would do sometimes they want to update some text they want to
make some quick changes maybe they want to replace a menu each each month right
or maybe the site went down and they need some help getting it back up stuff
like that can you show the password manager for
clients it's just you're going to use lastpass bitwarden onepass just google
password managers and pick one it's not really like anything special
lastpass yeah just use one and that's only at the end that's after you've
built everything remember everything's on your servers until the end
are we responsible for the copy on the site sometimes it's up to you
um if i'm working with a client that has no idea what they want sometimes i'll
throw that into my proposal hey i'm doing the design which will be a

02:47
template i'm doing the copy which is just stuff i'm gonna make up right and
that all adds to the money in the proposal
sometimes you'll work with a copy editor
or you work with somebody else to do the
copy or they already have copy they want to throw in it's kind of up to you
if we build a website with squarespace wix etc is that something you can put in
your portfolio yeah absolutely yeah what is copy copy is like the text on a
website like the text on the website yeah like the words that you put yeah
yeah text on the on the site um a lot of freelancers or folks when
they're new to freelancing get they get worried about squarespace
or they get worried about wic so they get worried about like these static site
builders but they're just tools that you can use to make your life easier
a lot of clients some some clients want to use them and so it's up to you to
decide if you're going to use them or not or if your clients want them or not

02:48
but they're just tools right somebody's running a business doesn't want to have
to learn how to use those tools they might but a lot of these folks that i work
with early on were older they they didn't like want to
invest the time they had like kids and like
they're they're at their jobs all day long and then at night they want to
spend time with their family they don't want to be investing their nights and
weekends in learning how to use squarespace or wix right so they pay me
to not have to worry about it and then even if they did use those other website
builders right they something happens right like they
don't know how to like make that bigger or move it around right and then it just
caused them headaches they'd rather pay me to come in and do their logo do their
design do the do the setting up the site make sure it all works and have someone
to talk to to help with ideas to help figure out how to do online payments and
all this stuff that they don't know how to do your job as a software engineer is

02:49
to solve problems and the moment you become a freelancer not only are you
solving technical problems but you're solving business problems too and so
instead of them having to think about how to do it you do that research
if they're a restaurant and they want to offer online ordering it's your job to
figure out what is the best way to get them hooked up with online ordering
right you have to do the research you'll have to play around with it you have to
ask questions on discord and then bake that into the site right
you're going to figure out how to do all
this and at first you you just ask a lot
of questions right and you figure it out
what are your feelings on wordpress it's good certain clients really like it a
lot of clients will ask for a cms or a content management system something
where they can go in and make quick changes and not have to bother you to
make those changes wordpress is one of the biggest versions of those so a lot
of clients ask for it and then you'll have to watch a tutorial
on how to use wordpress it's not hard you'll figure it out

02:50
but there are plenty of other cms's that are way easier to get up and running
than um than uh then wordpress including netlife netlife
has their own cms built in which is pretty cool
how quickly do you make a proposal oh amazing question i hope we still have
everyone this is a huge bit of information that i did not share early
on that i need it to on the conversation where i asked them
the magical question this i'm so glad you asked that question i would have
been really pissed if i had forgotten this all right when you
finish that conversation about the ballpark budget right
and they give you the ballpark budget your immediate response should be great
i'm going to build you a proposal that incorporates all the things we talked
about at that budget do you have time to talk on thursday
right like the next day like do you have time to talk this week how about

02:51
thursday so today's tuesday i would say hey i'm gonna build you an amazing
proposal i'm going to send you the proposal tonight you're going to get
that proposal tonight it's it's it's 9 30 but you're going to get the proposal
tonight i work quick i deliver a lot of value and i want to
show you that we're going to start this relationship off right so tonight you're
going to get the proposal do you have time this week to discuss
the proposal together how about thursday you make sure that you have scheduled
the next call right it doesn't have to be tonight it could
be tomorrow right like i'm gonna get this thing in your inbox first thing
tomorrow morning right right but you you make sure that you get it to
them quickly and then you don't hang up until you know the next time you're
talking to them you don't want the lead to fizzle right
a lot of times you'll send a proposal and then you'll go back and forth for a
week trying to find the next time if you're already talking to them make sure

02:52
you set up the next call send them a calendar invite saying discussing such
and such proposal right and then you work on the proposal you
send it to them as quickly as you can same day next day
in that proposal you say look really looking forward to our call on thursday
on thursday you get in that call and you work through the proposal with them you
i like to do it on the phone because you can hear
you can hear what they like what they don't like you can hear the uh or i
don't know right and then you can massage the proposal to fit what they're
looking for sometimes you might charge a little bit more money maybe you might
maybe you might do a little bit less right maybe you negotiate on time one of
the biggest things i negotiate on before we leave the proposal stage and go to
the contract stage is how long i'm going to take the work on it sometimes
i won't negotiate more money i'll just negotiate hey
you know what this is a big project it's

02:53
going to take me more time so instead of four months how about five or six right
and so the idea here is that you want to make sure that you don't let leads
fizzle you have the magic question what's your ballpark budget you're going
to get the proposal same next day then you already scheduled a call to talk to
them next cool are you normally one client at a time no
i normally have like two clients at a time sometimes more sometimes less
how do i price things that we don't know how to do you're never pricing anything
you're looking at their budget and you're going to think through what you
can do at that budget so if they say they have a budget of 3000 you're going
to look through everything they want and you're going to sit there like hmm
is there a reasonable way for me to build what they want you're going to
google you're going to look at you're going to look at different builders
you're going to look at different tools you're going to look at different things

02:54
is there a way for me to piece through what they want and can i give myself
enough time and enough money to get it done right
so you never pricing anything you're just working off their budget and what
you think you can get done at that budget
you've got a hundred dollar budget i'll i'll give you a wink and a smile and
send you an invoice right like i'll work with you i don't care what your budget
is i'll tell you what i can get done at that budget um i take every meeting
anybody that has an idea i take the meeting i find a way to provide them
value even if it's a wink and a smile and a firm handshake right i've given a
lot of firm handshakes and never worked with that person but i try to hand them
off to other engineers that might be able to work with them at that price point
you know and so i actually have referred a lot of
folks to other people and when they have a bigger project they come back to me
they remember how i treated them they remember i still gave them 30 minutes of
my time that i still answered all their questions and then i referred to

02:55
somebody that worked really great with them so they either go back to that
person they come to me with the larger project
how would you fire a client that's typically in my contract there is a walk
away clause that's in all my contracts what does 200 of web dev look like
that's up to you and how much you want to build
a lot of my students by this point in program
they can they can take a template and write some html and css to make it look
good to plug in their info right let's say you have a restaurant you would find
a restaurant template you plug in all their info it might take you four hours
and that might be a two hundred dollar project for you four hours of work at
fifty dollars an hour is not bad um the original
the original two projects that i did like the original two packages we sold

02:56
in the example where we dialed for dollars that was 500 and 800. if you're
working minimum wage you just made minimum wage in one day
like your whole month you made your whole month's salary in one day if you
do this process right so it's kind of up to you and what you
feel like you want to get done at that price point
and then remember taxes and stuff like that as well
what do we show our first client as a portfolio or skill set based on what we
know right now look at blah's portfolio they got a thousand dollar client
and an amazing job and the stuff that's on their portfolio are the homework
assignments that we did this is the homework assignment right here
i've i've already given you what needs to be on your portfolio

02:57
if you have done the homework you've made the homework your own you have
portfolio pieces y'all get it now you see what i'm trying to do
i'm trying to build what i'm trying to shape you into it all builds on top of
each other we add pieces block by block by block and we make it
right do you get it there's a reason why i gave you the hair salon
there's a reason why i gave you a restaurant website we just talked for
four hours about a restaurant website three hours of our restaurant website do
you get it now do you see do you see what i'm trying to do ah
i love that question all right let's let's answer like five

02:58
more questions and then we'll do a raid more questions and we'll do a raid
we don't get got we go exactly we don't get guy we go get
all right how do you pass a sniff test when you're building a template website
for clients they don't know and they probably won't ever
you know it's up to you to massage the templates to look good
but a lot of times you'll they'll have no idea like if we look at blah's site
this is this is a template this this looks like a template i think it's
template but this is beautiful this is perfect don't snitch on yourself
and ship it this looks great what what hair salon wouldn't be
um happy with that you know so it just it just won't come up

02:59
i'm currently laid off by taking a client i would void my unemployment what
suggestions to avoid this talk to the unemployment office i have
seen folks make deals with unemployment to be able to do freelancing so first
step is to talk to unemployment i have tons of folks that have still been able
to freelance and be unemployment at the same time don't do anything that would
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up your unemployment so talk to them first um
and like i said we're going to offer other suggestions that'll help you get
rid of that smell right that'll be like working on um open source projects
that'll be volunteering things like that you can do
all this stuff but not have the payment piece
still have contracts you still have proposals you you so my favorite thing
is like if you save applies to disability exactly
my favorite thing is like if you know that you can't charge you still do the

03:00
exact same process and then you give them a discount on your services so you
you you find a non-profit that needs all this stuff right and you they have a
budget of five thousand dollars you go through the exact same process and you
go you know what i really enjoy working with you all i'm
gonna give you a five thousand dollar discount on this first project but
i need you to be a reference customer uh for not only this like for any future
clients that i have any jobs things like that i'll give you a five thousand
dollar discount we'll get this project done at no cost but you have to be the
best reference that has ever existed in tarnation and i'm gonna put you to work
for a couple of other contracts right so you still do everything the same way
and you still get value the value to you might be different though
what's a good timeline strategy whatever you think it might take you you
double so i think most of my like first timers do

03:01
like around four months for their project
what do we do with the clips i'll create a thread in
uh probably the general channel after class
uh my wife owns a marketing firm she's willing to pass me some work helping her
with editing websites also creating websites would this be okay i think it's
great to do but push yourself to get clients that come not from close friends
or family so i think it's still great to do
but you still want to push yourself to figure out this process independent of
that all right templates red flags and interviews no
um what's the best way to handle billing collecting payment kind of already
talked about this there are plenty of services online that help you but just a
normal check or zell is also fine just make sure it's in the in the comment
all right what if i'm not entirely confident in my

03:02
ability to code yet especially with javascript doesn't matter
i would say most of my students that get clients don't know javascript yet
right yeah they just don't because it's only html and css you're talking about
like taking a template and filling in their info that doesn't take any
javascript it's just html or css and you'll your javascript skill will
increase your backend skills will increase and then you'll keep adding
stuff onto this as you go there's a lot more questions here
uh so i actually really like these questions keep adding questions keep
uploading questions and i think i'm going to do like a special session this
week maybe the tomorrow night i might just play pokemon and answer your
freelancing questions or something weird just because there's a lot of them and
we're going to answer more during office hours but if folks want to keep asking
more freelancing questions i think we'll just create like a time to to answer

03:03
those questions so i'll probably go live like either yeah
probably tomorrow or friday um and we'll just we'll just go through
rest of these questions thoughts on gen 9 i'm all for it i i'll always play a
mainline game um but yeah so we'll find a time to answer more of these questions
this sunday we're going to do a more like in-depth office hours we're going
to do html and css review we're going to look at some layouts we're going to add
javascript to those layouts and then we'll talk a little bit more about
freelancing as well i think that office hours will go a little bit later than we
normally do them and so let's go ahead and end with a lovely
raid uh you know we like to we like to spread some love some
positivity you haven't given them a follow give them a follow give them some
likes and then i will see you all i will see you all
on thursday if not tomorrow let's go ahead and raid

03:04
i'm gonna set it up right now one second alrighty let's see
all right hiccup interactive is live uh they're amazing developer they also do
like game development so let's go ahead and give them a raid
remember you get extra channel points for for doing the raid i'll see you all
over there have a good rest of your night hope you're excited to start
freelancing let's get some let's do a raid
thank you everyone hope you had a great night be over there peace
