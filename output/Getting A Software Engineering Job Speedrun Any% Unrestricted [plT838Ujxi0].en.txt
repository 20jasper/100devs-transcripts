00:00
the speed run getting a job folks I'm going to show you
how I would find the companies the messages I would send the step-by-step
instructions that I would follow to build out my Hit List to go about the
hunt in the appropriate way all about transcending being a clicker
right we don't have any clickers in this community
clicker is someone that posts on Reddit hey apply the 400 plus jobs and I I'm
not I haven't gotten one yet you know why because you and the just clicked

00:01
you're a clicker no Clickers we don't click apply WE Network our way
in we get our work in front of real living breathing human beings
that can can see what we've been able to do that can see our githubs going back
most that can see our full stack projects that can see the clients that
can see the volunteer organization that can see the pull request that can see
the open source contributions that can see the group projects that can see
all the work that you've done which always goes out the window
when you just click apply so no Clickers we're here to build Out The Hit List
live my goal tonight is to find 10 companies that I could
realistically apply to right 10 companies uh that I could submit my

00:02
proposal to I'm gonna do five that are local to me because local is always a
value-add and then I'm gonna do five that are like Global remote companies
that companies that will hire you no matter where else you live in this in
this beautiful world right so we're trying to get 10 within the first three
hours I'm gonna go slower tonight because I want to show you my process I
want to show you the things I think through the things that I would actually say
and then we're going to run it back on Tuesday and I'm just gonna lock in music
will be playing I'm gonna get 30 done in in three hours that's the goal so
tonight's a little slower we're going for five and five right we'll probably
take the full the full class period though just so I can explain how I'm
doing it the things I'm thinking through and then I'm going to show you how you
could grind out your Hit List in one class period That's the goal and then
we're gonna do it again because we got some Hit List to do live for folks that

00:03
won uh one of the Raffles back in the day so uh
let's get right into it I always set off with some questions if you got some
questions I got some answers you got some questions I got some
answers let's give folks another minute or two to get in here and then we'll get
started I know you said people shouldn't donate
would you rather folks donate instead of gifting a sub
um gifting Subs help others not have ads so I I guess that's good but I like
don't like don't sub don't don't get don't donate like no
can you go over the Big O notation for the stand-up problem uh no because that
problem wasn't about the Big O notation um the Big O notation was uh something
that we're gonna work up to during stand
up it was more about our methods so once we learn a little bit more we can come

00:04
back and talk about the the bigger notation Leon why do you still do this for us
like why because I want you to get jobs I've been on the other end of not having
food and Engineering was the thing that put food on the table
you can't have that experience and not want it for others that's why I do what
I do I want you all to get jobs I want you to have high paying high growth jobs
where you're happy and then I want you to turn around and
help three other people do the same thing it's not about money
the program is free but there's a cost
and the cost is answering [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] questions on Discord it's answering
questions here in chat it's turning around when you get a job and hiring
three other hundred deaf folks to pull up along with you that's the cost

00:05
we do that we we start to make a dent in folks that need help most
hey thank you for the gifted thumbs [Music] you know I have to I appreciate that
thank you for being here and thank you for all you do for the community
can't stop me Leon I appreciate you cool I appreciate that ghost as long as this
Discord exists I'm happy to be part of it and working to help others get us
where we all want to be hell yeah let's do this alrighty
uh looks like we got through some good questions here
if there's any other big ones beautiful all right so we're in it we're
in It to Win It like I said I'm going for 10 right

00:06
I'm in it for 10. I want five that are local and five that are remote uh that
are hiring anywhere I'm gonna take my time show you exactly what I would do to
not click apply to get myself in front of real people and so that's what we're
gonna do um before we start just in case we got some clickers in the audience
I just want to demonstrate briefly uh what clicking does one sec I need I

00:07
need to get something all right if you are Clicker this is your resume
and it's accurate because people that just click apply this is what their
resumes always look like blank nothing do you see any full stack projects no
do you see any client work no do you see GitHub with with three months of daily
history no accurate this is what a clicker's resume looks like
right if you click apply if you click apply this is what happens some ASMR going
all right if you click apply this is what you're doing with your resume right

00:08
Yee that's what you just did you just you just you just eat it you
might as well have printed out your resume crumpled it up and eated it
out the window Emma B said knock the trees Leon not the
trees and here let me tell you why printing out your resume thank you Emma
beef for highlighting this very important Point let me tell you why
clicking apply is worse than printing out your resume and eating it right
because when I crumpled up my resume and I needed it I I made Emma be angry
MMB is all up on Twitter right now Leon is littering
Leon doesn't care about the environment the trees they the they may be a good
software engineer but they don't care about the environment right and they
tweet it Emma B and I go way back this is this for funsies uh they they tweet it

00:09
and somebody sees ah there's Leon again destroying our forest but they can code
oh well I've been trying really hard to hire an engineer and maybe they might be
a good enough engine if if they can still be an engineer with this many
people that don't like their inaction on the environment uh maybe
they're just a really good engineer so let me actually let me slide in their
DMS let me sliding the DMC are you looking for a new engineering job and so
me printing out my resume crumpling it up angering the math is online
was actually more effective than clicking apply and I actually eat
it that out my window and as I eat it out the window
there just don't happen to be a falcon that thought it was a a white a baby

00:10
white snowy owl and the falcon grabbed it and and it flew off into the distance
right and and it flew over the 405 and it didn't see
it didn't see the Tesla coming down the 405 and the person in the Tesla wasn't
paying attention because they had the self-driving going on and the the bird
and the Tesla just boom and it it startled the person that was
in the front seat and they immediately turned on the
windshield wipers and the the blood is being I should say that the bird is
being smeared across the windshield and and through the the mess they could see
a small glimpse it says Leon software engineer and they go oh
damn this is a sign I I've been trying to hire a software engineer for a while

00:11
and they they reach over and and pull my
resume out out the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as they're going
down the 405. they see my email and they
send me an email saying hey I don't know if this is Destiny or not but we got an
open position and and that's how I got my last job right so so literally
printing out your resume crumpling it up and eating it out the window is ten
times better than just clicking apply so please don't be a who you know
flicker all right we don't need you all right do the things that we know are
going to help move the needle get your hard work you've worked two damn hard
to just click apply so tonight I'm going to show you the way
I'm going to show you how you can find individuals with open roles the real
messages you could send I'm gonna put them all in a document I'm going to

00:12
share the document after class you don't have to furiously type along everything
I type you'll have at the end of class tonight and then you are going to do the
same thing you are going to start building out your
Hit List over our next two classes we will do more hit lists I'm going to do
it live I'm going to show you how I can beat the world record Hit List building
together but tonight I'm gonna we're gonna take time
I'm going to show you the reality of it things might go well they might go bad
you never know like this is real like I I haven't prepped this I took a quick
peek at some stuff but I have no idea what I'm about to get into
when I start looking on these sites and and the people that we find all right
alrighty so we're going for five and five five local
five remote and the reason why I'm doing the five local first is being local is
an advantage you should always try and start local

00:13
uh if you're privileged to have a location that actually hires Engineers
uh you start there and then once you've exhausted the uh the local job market
you move on to a remote and then you move on to Global remote and so tonight
we're going to start local then we'll go remote and then we'll get Global remote
alrighty so I am blessed to be in La uh so the first
place I am going to start is in Los Angeles and tonight I'm gonna start off
with a site called Angel list angel.co jobs is the site I'm gonna
start off with uh the reason why I like this site I'm gonna put it in chat here
uh is because once you sign up I'll go to Lily on a second uh once you
sign up it's a little bit easier to find folks that are already working at these
companies I showed you the Hit List magic which shows you all the open roles
like how you can find all the open jobs and all the job boards and all that

00:14
stuff so we'll do that probably on Tuesday or Thursday next week when we're
trying to go for gold right like when we're trying to to go for for the world
record I'll I'll pull out all the tricks but as you're starting to get a little
bit as you're first starting out your Hit List to get comfortable with the
process I recommend starting with angelish and I'm going to show you why
because it's easier just to find folks that are already working at the
companies and so that's what we'll start off with
um then as we get further into The Hit List building I'm going to show you
other sites uh we're gonna move on to building out like going into specific
job boards that work well uh using companies like matter Mark that will
show you all the companies that have raised money Reese recently like that
would have budget to actually hire they were going to pull out all the tricks to
beat our world record but tonight I'm going to show you the things I do the
steps I take the tools I will use and we'll do it together we're gonna have

00:15
some fun uh as always I like please don't be weird I'm gonna be
pulling up all public information but it's gonna be real people with real
lives uh don't be uh uh uh an oddity and and do something inappropriate please
um let's go ahead and jump into this uh let's let's make sure that there are no
I'm gonna you know I'm gonna give a quick second for all the
clicker is the leave if you if you know you're a clicker just get out leave this
isn't for you I'll give you a second I'm going to take a sip of my tea
what if I'm a recovering clicker as long as you know the errors of your ways

00:16
you're welcome all right let's do this all right so I'm going to start off with
Angel list and right away on angelish you can you
can have some filters so I have software engineer I'm going to add a few other
things here uh full stack uh front end and back end might not move the needle
too much when it's just uh LA but once I turn this remote off
to remote including remote jobs this will have a bigger impact right
um so right now I'm going to say no remote and you can put some filters on
it if you want right away uh some common filters people will do is they'll just
restrict to like node or something like that I don't right out the gate restrict
node if I'm if I'm if I'm staying local right if I'm staying local I don't
um I don't filter right away if I notice that it's becoming overwhelming then I
can start filtering out for JavaScript no just to find those experiences but I

00:17
kind of want to get a pulse uh on what folks are asking for and I might pick up
a skill over a weekend to add to my resume so that I can add to The Hit List
uh one thing I might do is I could exclude some keywords I might exclude senior
uh staff uh lead and actually I'm not going to get rid of
lead because that looked like it chopped off significant so we're just getting
rid of some of the ones that that I I don't feel like for this first wave of
my my search I I'm not going to include uh you could even leave these off for
right now because it's still local you're definitely gonna want these when
we go remote um because remote's gonna uh give you so
it's gonna be like four or five thousand
different leads and you're going to want to narrow those down to better fits for
you when it's local you can fudge a lot more uh company size was also kind of

00:18
important to me I find The Sweet Spot between like 11 and a thousand is where
I've seen students have the most success early on doesn't mean that folks that
are applying to bigger companies or smaller companies doesn't work it's just
something that I think through like medium-sized companies typically I've
had better results with so something I'm going to pay attention to not something
I'm going to filter right now and I was going to start with these
these results okay now the other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to filter
by last active so you could do most recent like most recently post
um but active says jobs who engage most recently first so I want folks that are
like actually on Angel list that are actually posting
and I think that's a better way to sort by uh than just kind of like recommend
or anything like that so last active I'm gonna do
I have the the different jobs that I might be interested in I have my area

00:19
and remote is off so now I feel like I can start looking through these results
now before I start looking through the results I want to make sure that I have
my sheet so exclamation point sheet in chat if you don't have your networking
sheet remember the networking sheet also has The Hit List as a tab so I'm in the
way I'm just in the way it was right there right there there's two tabs
right there's two tabs behind my head one says networking and one says Hit
List uh we're using The Hit List The Hit List is the tab that we're using and so

00:20
you can just do file make a copy right make a copy and then call it like
whatever you want so networking uh yeah just make a copy of it
save it to your drive and and now you have your own copy of it
and once you have your own copy of it you can just shift to The Hit List um
and what you'll notice is that everything you need here to kind of keep
track of what's Happening right all right keep track of what happening
so I'm gonna have on my Hit List the company name uh the date that I added
them to the spreadsheet so like did I add this company a year ago today
whatever the link to the job description sometimes I put like the role if I'm if
I'm going fast I'll kind of skip this stuff here and then I'm going to start

00:21
putting my contacts that I found at those companies so the goal is to find a
company that's actively hiring find real people at that company right uh whether
the name whatever their position uh did you send them an email excuse me did you
send them an email a Twitter DM a LinkedIn message like
what did you do uh to get in contact with them and then did you have any
follow-up steps did you get a coffee chat did you send a thank you letter
remember if you're looking at exclamation point templates here in chat
you have plenty of thank you letter templates that you can follow to send
your thank you letters after your initial contact right thank you Stephanie um
so we have our Hit List where we have the the name the
role the person we reached out to what we did with that person so do we have a
coffee chat did we did we follow up Etc so just a good place to keep track

00:22
of The Hit List when I'm going fast I like to use the sheet just to get all my
contacts on here once I feel like I have
a decent hit list I got the 60 companies that I found that are like local first
and remote and I've I've kind of massaged it a little bit I might move to
a different platform I might move to a hunter I might move to a notion with
like individual cards for each of these contacts something that might help me
visualize the process a little bit better but in the beginning I use the
sheet I like going fast I like adding stuff and not having to think move
whatever just plop it in and keep moving speed is the name of the game when
you're first kind of getting started with your hit list and so I just have my
sheet exclamation point sheet if you need it here in chat if you need the
email templates exclamation point templates and chat you got them so now
we have our sheet we have our templates we have our Angel list I'm gonna start
looking at some of these jobs will be the use of notion some folks just like

00:23
to have like a kanban board where they put each person on a kanban board and
they move it to like sent a message had a coffee chat asked for a referral right
and they just kind of like moved the cards across
I find that takes too much time for me and I prefer the sheet in the beginning
once I'm deep in like reaching out to folks and like I've already done the
prospecting then I think the kanban board makes a little bit more sense and
I'll show you that next week you can use GitHub projects yep exactly
like they're they're plenty of free tools that do the kanban boards
but what you're noticing is that this is a process this is real work and um
the folks that are just you know clickers just doing click click click
click click click click click click click click click they
this is why it doesn't work if you're putting in all this work

00:24
and they're just doing uh come on now come on now come on now
all right so we got our results we're looking software engineer full stack
engineer front and back end we're looking in the LA area remote is off no
filters let's take a look what we got all right so this first part is you just
kind of like click through you see something that might interest you
software engineering intern remember we're going fast we're not overthinking
anything all right GoodRx is America's HealthCare Marketplace they have a
software engineering internship great I don't care about how much money it is
whatever it is it just seems like it's in my area it could be a good thing
hiring contact right away this is why I love Angelus look the person I should be
talking to is legitimately listed already right boom you can also
take a look at all the team members right and you can see all the team

00:25
members that are listed on Angelus so these are all potentially folks I could
reach out to but whenever a company lists the person you should talk to uh
that is the person I am going to reach out to first so let's actually click on
their their profile here uh technical acquisition partner to high
growth and emerging startups uh there's no Twitter linked here but maybe a
LinkedIn is cool uh so their LinkedIn is here
I have a mutual connection let's go let's go boom let's go oh easy easy let's go
[Laughter] foreign so I don't even need to send them a cold

00:26
message right like if let's see what they have um contact info
is just linking to their to their profile here uh so this is interesting
because there's no first oh message boom messages are open hell yeah
open messages this is easy let's go hold on 10 second warning five seconds
[Music] all right it says free message why I don't know but

00:27
because I have some free message something premium whatever uh it might
be because I have premium I don't know but the messages are open because a lot
of folks don't have messages open why does it say free why I don't know anyway
messages are open I don't have premium so I don't I'm not sure why but it just
sometimes people can have open messages all right uh this is actually something
I went to school with so I could actually probably reach out to them and
see if they really do know them um but since the messages are open I'll
start off with that before I send a message um before I send the messages
let's see can I find anything about them uh they just have their UCLA um
good RX so it looks like they went straight from UCLA into GoodRx let's
look at their profile real quick recruiter

00:28
there's really not too much for me to go off on this profile
so what I'm going to say is I would send I would send a subject
right so subject would be all right first let's get them let's get them on
our uh hit list so we found them Hit List we're gonna say company GoodRx
uh URL to the position the person I'm gonna say LinkedIn so I'm gonna put the
LinkedIn there I'm gonna grab their name from LinkedIn boom
and put that on my Hit List as well and I'm gonna put the URL to the job
on here as well all right so there's a couple ways I'm

00:29
probably going to go about this right because now I have the the messages were
open on LinkedIn um if not I could go through my friend
that knows them but I feel like I could just probably reach out to them directly
and so with the message there's really nothing here I really do
like to find something special um best place to eat on UCLA campus cool hey
Fergie I'm gonna say something along the lines of I saw that good RX

00:30
uh was hiring on Angel list I would love five minutes say engineers
I saw good exercise hiring Engineers on angels I would love five minutes of your
time of your time to discuss the open rolls or your
favorite place to eat on UC UCLA campus as I am spending a lot of time
there recently UFO have a great rest of your week cheers yeah boom
all right and so this is kind of right off the Jump remember

00:31
can't lose a job that you don't already have right can't lose a job
that you don't already have what I'm going for is something
that will get them to open the message right
something that will get them to open the message something that will get them to
actually give me the time of the day right
and so that's what I'm gonna go with uh and then before I send it of course
going to proofread best place to eat on UCLA campus I saw your good exercise
hiring Engineers on angels I love how much you're trying to discuss the open
rules or your favorite place you know you say is campus as I'm spending a lot
of time there recently have a great rest of your week cheers Leon boom uh so I
spelled you were wrong all right uh or your favorite place to eat on you so
this campus 20 a lot of time there recently our grocery week cheers and

00:32
haven't found a good spot yet boom there you go
I don't have grammarly installed on this
profile I actually don't even know if it would work in here but cool so that's
something I would send and I'm gonna add that to my list here
of just messages that I would send um with the
with the message right like we're going here we went for we got what we wanted
right we said like hey uh Saul GoodRx was hiring Engineers on
ageless well if I'm into your time to discuss open roles or your favorite
place to eat on UCLA's campus and I'm spending a lot of time there recently
and haven't found a good spot yet right so just something that opens up the door
that that is that is that is simple that will maybe get them to open it I I
don't care if it's funnier like it's just something that that would get them

00:33
to to open right uh is the smiley face unprofessional it doesn't really matter
I I like this one it's your own personal voice I like smiley faces in certain
spots when I'm trying to be cheeky right like I know that I'm reaching out to
them on LinkedIn I know they're getting all these dry ass messages from folks I
know that they're like getting all these things that are like hi I have five
years of experience I graduated from MIT in 1985 like no like
let me try and be a human right and I can't lose a job that I don't already have
right yeah more friendly exactly right and so
uh I thought I always go for it I always make sure they tell them they have a
good week like something that might catch their eye because they just they
were at UCLA right trying to come across as more casual and if I if I lose it I
lose it who cares right I lose it I lose it who cares right but that's what I

00:34
would say great so that's my first company I would also just take a quick Gander
um at other folks that are on here uh to see if there's any like engineer
type folks [Music] um if if this person didn't get back to me
I might go towards one of their found like one of their like maybe not
Founders because they're a little bit bigger of a company
um yeah they're like 200 people once you get over 200 people the the founders
really stop responding but you'd be surprised at like under 200 they they
respond to me quite a bit um but I don't really see any other
Engineers so I would start here uh I would maybe list this in my hit list um
just just here in case uh I don't hear back from Virgie I would put this on my

00:35
list and then come back cool all right remember
overthinking messages in my business exactly it just don't overthink it just
do it just go get in the flow you're trying to send out 180 of these a hundred
180. three people at each of the companies if you're here sweating a smiley face
oh boy just shoot your shot and move on doesn't matter
all right let's go back let's take a look at some of these other open rolls
what a what a dub on the first one right what a dub on the first one
uh of course no it's all gonna be it's
all gonna go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] after that uh edify

00:36
node.js developer web developer in Santa Monica they have a listed person Julia
oh nothing though this is the person supposed to be reaching out to Eddie Phi
let's give him a good old Google edify Julia oh here we go LinkedIn message
or messages open let's go all right let's go
oh I was big Leon I'm just getting hyped
I'm sorry let me go through and show you what I did all right so
uh edify so I clicked on the web developer role that they had uh it's in
Santa Monica which is which is next to La they had Julia but there's nothing on

00:37
their profile uh so I just gave them a good old Google their name
and so I just did their name and edify and the first result was their LinkedIn
um and it's open messages I'm not sure if they're like trying to give me like a
free premium or something it won't let me click why um
I do see they're trying to give me a like it might be like I'm not sure if
they're open uh or if it's like a free premium or something like that uh one of
the things I I heard is that LinkedIn always does um
LinkedIn always does like events and they always sponsor so many events right
all right so they are open messages thank you for checking MLB right uh they
are open great so LinkedIn does so many events or sponsors so many events
um the cool thing is if you go to any of those events they always give out
premium like you can just talk to any of
the people that are running the event or at the event and say hey I'm going
through my job search can I get like a pass for premium and they they just give

00:38
it out like like free candy so you can always get if you if you're trying to
get premium LinkedIn which you don't honestly need I'm going to show you how
like I do it when their things aren't open
um you can get it from just going to one of those events
yep I got six months free from an online conference exactly yeah
all right so messages are open uh um University of Oregon student athlete
University of Chicago Courts for kids Staffing corporate
they have any other links no Twitter or anything let me just give them a Google
again real quick I we have a Twitter that pops up um
nothing pops up I'm going a little slower than I normally would just
because uh I'm not doing like a super super speed run I don't see too much

00:39
let's see do they have any activity uh post do they have any posts [Music]
Serena go uh junior developers on the front end team

gonna be a good day for you like that's not a good look for us it's
not a good look for our community uh don't do it
yeah we don't we don't want to be bombarding these people with messages
and actually the the same message right uh be cool like don't be don't be that
person yeah if if I if if we find out that's like a
problem then I can't keep doing this right and so don't be that person please

00:46
don't ruin it for everyone else yeah all right we got two already I like it
two so far let's keep going I'm gonna clean up my My Links here all right
let's see what else we got here Epsilon three QA let's see
is it easy to find someone they have a link
now all right I'm Gonna Keep moving I might come back to that one
I'm going for speed front end engineer and they use emojis

00:47
they're speaking my language Sydney Tom no link Sydney Tom let's see
uh let's go ahead and see Embrace is the name of the company is there a website
that they list Embrace IO um cool to embrace IO type in this person's name
all right Sydney Tom Embrace IO uh no open messages contact info
is just their LinkedIn looks like they're more in product than they are um
looks like they're more in product than like recruiting but that's actually
going to be a value add they went from from design

00:48
they went from recruiting to product design
interesting we can use that let's look at their website real quick to see if
they link the people on the website uh sometimes they just put like email
addresses and stuff like that on the website so let's go to their website
real quick um there we go about us is what I'm looking for about us
there why combinator company that's cool or no they
Port white combinator all right I don't see I don't see any
like people or anything like that linked to the company and so what I'm going to
try doing is I don't see their let me just try Google one more time here

00:49
and I'm going to do I'm just going to put Twitter see if their Twitter comes up
um their corporate Twitter actually their corporate Twitter was linked here
let's see if they follow Sydney if you see their name tell me
I'm sure there's a way to search for this I just don't see it um
all right I don't see it let's just try to uh let's not do that all right so I
don't see their Twitter I don't see I just see their LinkedIn

00:50
this could be them Sydney 90 let's see no Sydney Wells not you all right so
what we're going to do is we're going to use another website called Hunter
uh dot IO and I'm gonna put the company in embrace.io and
it looks like they're they're format is first name at embrace.io right
first name could be an embrace.io and uh I think I could just use that
so let's go ahead and I didn't control that I didn't control F I just scrolled

00:51
so you got you got to get in your Flow State you know all right so
um it's a small company there's a good shot that there are not two Sydney's
with this spelling um so I am going to go and shoot my shot here and
uh just send an email and so it would just be how do I say that Sydney boom copy
so it would just be Sydney right at embrace.io
oh did it actually pop up hold on let's do that again slower
or that might be somebody else like in my contact book

00:52
oh Google Google with the assist Google coming through you got got [Laughter]
Google snitched yes let's go all right do we have
anything about Sydney though we just know that they went from recruiting the
product uh or it went from recruiting to her product um
going from recruiting to product we know that from their LinkedIn I'm going to
close this um so let's go ahead and write that email transitioning to product

00:53
would love to learn about your experience transisting trend position ing
use grammarly folks just use grammarly if anything you learned tonight just use
grammarly because my spelling my grammar is atrocious um a
Sydney always double check your spellings that's like the biggest
mistake you can make early on it's just like not spelling their name right
person's name is the sweetest sound in any language all right so we're gonna
say this and we're gonna take a break we'll do this one take a break uh Hey
Sydney I saw that embrace is looking for engineers on Angelus
and you were listed as the contact I noticed on LinkedIn LinkedIn that you

00:54
transitioned into product and I am currently trying to do the same thing
would you happen to have a few minutes to share your you have to share your
Journey with me have a great week cheers yeah hey Cindy I saw that
I saw that Embrace is looking for engineers on Angelus and you were listed
as the contact I also know also I noticed also

00:55
also I noticed on LinkedIn that you transitioned into product and I'm
currently trying to do the same thing would you happen to have a few minutes
to share your journey with me have a great week cheers Leon boom
this is really tiny there we go bigger better short and sweet exactly
right short and sweet um not not really going for like the quick win um
right not going for the quick win um that's it
uh if they don't have their messages open should we add them directly on
LinkedIn with a note you can I think that's kind of like my like my normal
process is I add them to my hit list right I try LinkedIn messages if they're
open Twitter DMS if they're open if Twitter message if Twitter DMS are not
open LinkedIn messages aren't open and I

00:56
can find their email then I'll just send the email with a message like this if I
don't ever hear back from the email then I might try sending the connection on
LinkedIn and when you send a connection you can send a message
uh I thank you for pointing it also not Leon is speaking their message out loud
to catch some mistakes I do this with all my textual messages to ensure
they're actually good uh yeah I do the same thing uh the reason why I like I go
slower of my emails is I always read them out loud uh so hey Cindy I saw that
and braces looking for engineers on Angelus and you were listed as the
contact also I noticed on LinkedIn that you transitioned into product and I am
currently trying to do the same thing would you happen to have a few minutes
to share your journey with me have a great week cheers Leon boom easy ask if
they are the contact they're going to respond um
I'm going to change this from experience to Journey

00:57
um just because experience sounds like like a Spam message
cool all right I'm gonna add that to my list here I'm gonna make sure that
Sydney is on my list boom just I'm just putting these all
here so you have all the messages that I'm actually sending um let me grab the
the actual uh subject here and I'm gonna make sure that they're on my hit list
well I almost forgot to add into my Hit List um
I didn't add the other person too oh I'm slipping

00:58
all right job listing for embrace full Embrace URL uh name was Sydney Tom
uh I have their LinkedIn somewhere that I could put in there as well and
that's good for now and what was the other company that we did it was Julia
uh edify edify it was Julia and I'd put their link I put their
linked in here I just forgot to do it but you you it's what you would do um and
let's make sure we put the edifier Roll in there before we lose it
I just click on the actual role which is web developer joint

00:59
all right and it was Julia magdalino boom putting the URL in there
all right cool so I'm going I'm going to okay I would normally going about twice
the three times the speed um if I was doing it just without like an
audience here uh but that's kind of what I'm going through like I hope that
you're starting to see like that I'm not
really overthinking it uh I am trying to find some way to kind of connect with
the person even so briefly uh through the messages I'm sending just looking
for little Snippets of the thing that might get them to open the message uh I
don't really care if it works or not I'm just trying to shoot my shot 180 times
and if you do shoot your shot 180 times you start getting responses back they'll
start snowballing into actual uh interviews and interview interviews

01:00
actually become jobs so this is the real process uh when I ask folks to fill out
your hit list this is exactly what I would do if I was looking for a job in
my local area so we're gonna take our break because we're at the top of the
hour we are going to uh we are going to do two more local and
then we're going to do five remote and we'll see if we can get all that done
within our three hours time are you even reading the job description to see if
it's a good fit are you just reaching out for everything
the sun touches I apply for everything the Moon
cast a warm dewy glue over I apply foreign

01:01
to you if you get in your head trying to find good fits before you even get a
response from someone you're just putting too much energy into it you're
not doing it right you might as well just start clicking apply all right so I
don't overthink it if I get if I get a response from them right if I get a
response from them then I do my research I do my digging I make sure that I'm
well prepared for that conversation but the only thing I'm honestly looking for
right now is is it a job in my area and is it something that I think reasonably
is a good fit so like know it is a good fit web developer is a good fit did I I
skipped over the senior Java like the senior role in the
language I don't I don't code in right um I skipped over the quality assurance
engineer because I just didn't feel like doing it but
everything the sun touches you apply to and then you you you collect your

01:02
winnings does it pay money exactly all right
how do you handle when you network they message back but they send you an online
application link to click apply how rude uh then you apply and like I
would send it like if they send this home I send a cheeky message back I am
totally in the camp I can't lose a job that I don't already have
uh so if they send that back uh I I it depends on the company
I I always say something like do you want to get McDonald's after work or
something just that would just that would just be out there that they would
they would have to respond right I don't know exactly what it would be but it'd
be something to get their like attention right
um if you're getting a lot of those then you're not um
you're not crafting your messages in a in a in a way that seems approachable

01:03
like look let's look at my look at my messages real quick right let's take a
look at this best places to eat in the UCLA campus
I'm asking them to respond I'm already connecting right it's they know that I
put some effort into this right I had to do like like the bare modicum people
that are sending out those messages are just getting spanned with folks reaching
out to them and so when you do so when you take this this little extra step to
make it like approachable you get less of those types of responses um
I I like my my message to like my subject to Julie was like thank you for
talking about me like of course I was gonna get them to look like that might
make them laugh if I can make them laugh a little bit I know my responses are
gonna increase right um same thing with transitioning the
product I'm not really even making it about the role right like I like I don't
even I just want to talk to them about their journey and the product and I'm
generally interested like how they transitioned in the product we are all

01:04
transitioning into product roles or engineering roles right and so I'm
generally interested in that and so if you're just going for the kill right
right if you're just going for the kill you're gonna get more of those types of
like just click apply responses but if you're individualizing it you're making
it a little bit funny you're giving it something to to answer then those types
of responses decrease and remember we're trying to do this at
like three different people at each company uh and so one person might do
that but the other two might not there you go
are you gonna do some other examples of other websites besides Angelus yeah
probably on our speed run though uh Angelus is a really good place to start
for most folks but uh use The Hit List magic uh search
that I gave you all in the slides from previous classes and that's you can find
up all your open roles yeah alrighty uh let's go and take our break

01:05
because it's the top of the hour all right folks come on back come on back
uh Hunter only gives me the customer service emails uh that's what we're not
we're not actually looking for their real email we're looking for the format
of the email like if we look there is actually one email here that
helped me and it was this Eric embrace.io so I knew that if they're
using first name at embrace.io that it might be a good shot of it just being
first name and embrace.io because they're smaller
right and so then I plugged that into Google and Google snitched and maybe
that's actually the right email address or maybe I get a uh uh could not send
message and then I find a better one but
that's kind of I'm just trying to figure out like is it first name last name is
it first name is it yeah you know let's get a few questions in before we
kind of go back into uh hunt mode here our company's more responsive if they've

01:06
recently received more funding apps absolutely
um so one of the things I I will show you probably on Tuesday for some reason
the website's down right now I've kept trying to connect it might be my vpns or
something but there's a website called matter Mark uh which is a similar
company to Crunch based but it's completely free
uh and what you can do is you can just see companies that have raised funding
like startups that have raised the money and if I see a a tech company that's
raised a good series a series B there's a good chance that they might be hiring
and I try and reach out to those companies quicker especially if they're
in my area I said red flag the company has one year
preferred front-end experience but also says they want a senior front-end Dev
for the description can it be one year scene can a one year be senior a zero
year can be senior depends on the company uh it just doesn't matter don't
overthink any of those things just Network your way in and then deal with

01:07
it later mm-hmm do you recommend reaching out to
companies that just got accepted into Tech Stars no because they have very
little money maybe if they like if they get a year in
um and they raised their series a or something but early on they they have
little money yeah we had blah on the t-spell on
Friday they started off as a senior yeah so the interview is where you're trying
to sniff out the red flags in a company yeah I I really pay attention to how I'm
treated during the interview process right I'm really that's what I pay
attention to like how was I treated was
that I feel like they had their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
together like did they send out like good emails did they follow up with me
like was I treated well was that was their stuff organized all that leads me
to build a picture and then once I get an offer I go in and ask all the

01:08
questions I talk to all the people uh and that's when it kind of gets real
I thought I was saying Jasper for some reason the site's not loading today it
was bought by full contact oh they might have yeah they might have sold
yeah I thought it was just down but maybe they got bought by somebody else
you can use crunch base it's the same thing but I believe crunchbase like
gives you only a certain number of free ones
um before it goes away but that's that's just another strategy it's not a
strategy you have to use I just find that strategy has worked for a couple of
my students in the past where if you live in a city specifically City that a
city that has like um I don't know like a decent Tech economy
then the like looking at folks that have raised money in your area could be
helpful uh crunchbase started charging you for
the first one we'll find something else that does it similarly

01:09
cool all right let's get two more local and then we will move on to the global
remote feel free to ask questions as we're going through this
um like I'm just trying to show you like a real process and then once you get
into a flow you do this a little bit faster all right let's take a peek go back
all right n-i-n-h-n global a wholesale fashion
Marketplace one week ago web developer back-end developers click on web
developer they have anyone listed no one listed there they have people

01:10
see all their team members you actually die uh nah
I'm gonna go with something else their their stack is also like really not
I mean I could go down that but I'm just trying to do a speed run an engineer
build the Netflix of high school education hell yeah I might actually
submit this one uh talk directly to their CEO that's cool
anyway all right let's see do they have their messages open

01:11
Angeles what's going on all right uh uh subject
launched Uber Freight that's pretty cool UPenn ba UCLA MBA
uh they're LinkedIn let's see if they have open messages are open let's go
all right so the messages that we would send would be
all right so we know they're passionate about like education
let's see if there's anything else here ex-athlete turn serial entrepreneur

01:12
any negative and positive because probably injury is contagious uh um Nomad Uber
the uh UCLA um a hockey for the Colombian ice hockey team that's pretty cool
remember a Soho House all right now there's a lot there let's
also look at their Twitter real quick always early never flake
I might use that I think that's the easy in
don't want your ZIP code or your family Association of status dictate the

01:13
subjects you can take that's pretty cool all right we're gonna go with that
all right let's send them a message to be early and not flake
there we go that would be the hook there they say that pretty quite often so I'm
gonna I'm gonna use that uh I promise to be early not flake hey Michael
's always tricky because you guys sometimes it helps to see if you can
find if they refer to themselves as Mike or Michael um
looks like Michael who's listening on their Twitter I might even read a um
uh an article just to see if they talk about themselves slightly different but
y'all can do that I'm not gonna do that all right Michael I am really

01:14
I'm a an engineer really passionate about making education affordable uh
accessible to all I don't know how to spell accessible but
we can Google that later all right I'm going to enjoy really passionate about
making education accessible to all I'm actively
oh God damn you're just seeing how bad I spill involved in the 100 devs

01:15
community which has helped hundreds of folks get jobs as engineers regardless
of their economic reality oh that's something along those lines
um engineer really passionate about making education accessible to all I'm
actually involved in 100 desk Community which helped hundreds of folks get jobs
Energy Enterprise and economic reality I would love five minutes of your time to
talk about the open roles at subject have a great great great week cheers Leanne

01:16
also on down to clear it up on the ice anytime I just hope my roller
hockey skills Translate um all right so I probably really not flake because
you know they're going to open there's no way they don't open that message
so textual exactly hey Michael I'm an engineer really passionate about making
education accessible to all I'm actually involved in the hunter devs Community
which has helped hundreds of folks get jobs and Engineers regardless of their
economic reality I would love five minutes your time to talk about open
rules of subject when it's somebody like a CEO or a co-founder um

01:17
when somebody like a CEO or a co-founder I I always I'm a little bit more like
on the nose like hey I'm curious about the open rolls like I don't wanna like
if they're a recruiter you can I don't I don't like I'll play a little bit but
um if I don't want to take their time like I want to be I want to be straight
to the point uh about your open rolls have a great week um
and just so you know roller hockey skills don't translate all right I like
this this is what I would send set it to the list
Melody hey thank you for the gift it says thank you for being here and
congrats on the new gig let's go turn up so proud so happy glad to see you
crushing the game let's put the subject in there too
because I think that's important thank you for being here

01:18
uh let's put that in there too all right uh and then this was
let's just grab their LinkedIn add them to our hit list this is subject
and we'll add the URL there I talked to [Music] Michael Gallardo and
I was LinkedIn so these these are all pan this was uh LinkedIn this was LinkedIn
and this was email cool just keeping track of like the folks I'm talking to
um and this should actually not be here this should be this should be here

01:19
boom and let's grab that open roll um so like it's a little bit more of a
senior role but that's okay all right here we go
all right Let's do let's get one more local and then we'll switch gears to to
remote student apps us-based banking lending crypto as a service provider yikes
Halo move science forward dress life provides fashion specific to
one-to-one personalization with exceptional accuracy JavaScript and node
why are they listing it in Euros oh it's promoted

01:20
I'm like why are these salaries lower and why is it not in USD like why are
they paying this in La I got [Laughter] dubsado tools for Freelancers that's
cool a venture technology Studio where Innovation rules that just sounds more
fun let's go there first uh Darren Rush is the founder and that's
who we should reach out directly um they want experts go on Ruby
there's no they don't have any employees so it doesn't seem like my medium the
side like I like if I was really doing this like I would I would just if I was
doing The Hit List they would have message no problem I'm not overthinking it um

01:21
I'm just trying to be a little bit more impactful because y'all are watching
uh founder kind of the same thing a little bit smaller coming week we might
come back to one of these two if there's
something better before we uh get out of the local ones
oh I love Supernatural shut up this is like the only thing I pay for in
the Oculus uh cool uh they're so big they're just saying
Talent let's see if they have any people on here um
all right let's go to LinkedIn real quick uh let's search super natural

01:22
and looks for people there's the CTO director product technical program
management director of engineering they're in Santa Monica whereas this
person said Redmond Washington so this person they don't have open messages
whoa their deal was blocked by the FTC what that's wild
all right contact info Twitter all right they have a Twitter that's open

01:23
messages are not open they like to fly engineer Tech exec
I might send them in I might send this person an email
their messages weren't open I feel like I could write a good message to them
but there's also the CTO that legitimately said that they were hiring
so somebody puts that in their profiles like asking to be reached out to or
hiring they still oh it's a different company never mind
I'm gonna go with this person let's see if we can find their email um

01:24
let's go to supernatural's website Supernatural VR
the website is getsupernatural.com let's go to Hunter pool
see what their style is uh I would try first name at supernatural.com
this is kind of or what you could also do is you can just tweet at them directly
so the cool thing is like when you add someone it doesn't actually show up like
in your timeline it shows up in um like it just is like a message to
them it doesn't like show up in your timeline shows up again like your other
like your tweets replies um we could do that we could connect with
them on LinkedIn and send a note that's kind of always the last thing I try

01:25
though um was this stuff that they said again I like flying
it does say that they're hiring contact me if you were oh that was with Within
to say here oh yeah and talk to me if you or someone
you know might be interested in these positions all right cool so they've
already said contact me um so I'm gonna skip I would do I would tweet them
but they did say contact me so I'm gonna actually try email first if the email
doesn't work that's okay I'll come back to tweeting them but it does say contact

01:26
them it literally says contact them uh it just doesn't have any contact info
I'm just gonna grab their first name and I'm gonna try an email uh let's compose
I'm gonna try an email and I'm just going to try
at get super let's get supernatural.com okay I mean that might have worked I
don't know if that was Google snitching again
why connect and send a note as last resort because I don't like connecting
with people that I don't honestly know so we started off tonight with an
absolute dub where the person I connected with like the person I was
trying to reach I had a connection I already had somebody that I knew that
I went to school with that was connected
to that person and so if I really wanted
to I could just reach out to that person and say hey could you give me an intro

01:27
to that first person that we saw and that's how I like to keep my LinkedIn I
I know every single person that's on my LinkedIn and I know that if I reached
out to them they would give me a referral and if I didn't if I didn't have that
then I would I it would be like if I I don't want my Lincoln to be muddied
right and so that somebody said I had a connection with this person too did I

01:28
[Music] yes I can reach out to them let's go yo through the boardroom y'all
I could get up here and just talk my
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and run my mouth about stuff I haven't done but y'all see it
when I tell you I put in this work I put in this work
when I put in this work I put in this work I showed you all my my my 100 plus
days in a row of GitHub commits when I was doing my coding challenges
I tell you how I do my networking and literally random companies that we
are finding random people at this company I'm already connected to or one
hop skip and a jump I'm not I'm not making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I'm
trying to show you how this stuff can change your life
there is a reason why I talk about networking until I I can't talk no more

01:29
five companies that I randomly found out of those five two I was connected
directly one skip through with the person that I wanted to get in touch with
imagine if you did your networking like I've been asking you to do and you
did it for 10 years just think about that you do one event a
week for five years do five one event a week for five years you meaningfully
connect with people and it slowly builds up over time and that's where you're at
now right like like you're seeing it this is the proof right that's the proof
cool so I I could reach out to my connection I've worked with them in the
past uh and and that would be it cool but I'll send an email just because I'll

01:30
start there just to show y'all um they like flying uh that's what I'll lead with
any good lying VR apps hey boom like that uh anyway I just got got an Oculus
and I'm always looking for fun apps to try anyway uh let's go and say um I saw

01:31
on Angelus that Supernatural was hiring and thought I would Reach Out
Supernatural I just got an Oculus hiring Engineers always say Engineers
because that that would Peak their director of engineering I saw an Angelus
that Supernatural was hiring Engineers I
thought I'd reach out just got an Oculus and Supernatural is the only app

01:32
I pay for it only paid app on my account cool
I would love five minutes of your time to learn about the open roles
I don't know if I'm into your time to learn about the open about open roles
and uh I'll say your LinkedIn your LinkedIn mentioned that I should
reach out about open roles I would love five minutes of your time to learn more

01:33
talk about cool stuff happening in VR cheers yeah
I really do use Supernatural yeah it is it is legitimately the only app
that I paid for outside of the the table tennis app
um but that's like not a recurring charge cool all right any good flying VR apps
because I they're into flying they're in the VR boom I saw an Angelus that
Supernatural was hiring engineers and thought I would reach out I just got an
Oculus Supernatural is the only paid app
on my account uh your LinkedIn mentioned
that I should reach out about open roles I love if I'm into your time to learn
more or talk about cool stuff happening in VR cheers Leon uh have a great week

01:34
the the table tennis app is wild the table tennis app is absolutely wild
uh so wild that hold on one second if you live in LA and want to catch some
hands I'm ready to play um I 3D print it I 3D printed a handle
or my Oculus controller with actual like grip tape yeah
it's so realistic it is so realistic like the feel
of like actually hitting the ball in VR it feels like you're playing on a real
table um so yeah it actually is a pretty dope app
and I yeah I went I went um I went extra laughs

01:35
uh I feel good about this I think this is pretty solid I think they would
actually respond somebody said what if the email doesn't work yeah 11 is the is
the app uh what if this email doesn't work
um then I would probably reach out to my contact on LinkedIn I know that all you
have that yet um but if that didn't work I would tweet them I would tweet them
cool so let's add this to our list foreign and

01:36
I'm going to add this to my hit list email it was Supernatural and and
I'll grab the job description um all right there we go like I said
I try not to overthink this um I try not to overthink this I'm trying
to find things that are slightly funny you can't lose a job that you don't have
um I find that my responses are pretty high
when I send messages like this and so just don't overthink it you're doing 180
of these just get through it uh and when we come back on Tuesday I'm gonna do a
speed run so I'm gonna actually go way faster I'm going to like ignore chat put
music on and just like grind I can get through like 30 of these or like 10 an
hour I can get like 10 good an hour and so if I like took a weekend I could

01:37
probably bang out most of my Hit List in a weekend
um and so yeah it's a lot of work right it's a lot of work like you're finding
these people you're trying to find a way
in you're thinking about them uh but I'm going to share all the messages exactly
yeah you already have uh the the templates here that were or base
templates I'm gonna add all the templates that I've been writing tonight
to this list as well um so you could see uh so you could see like the actual
messages I'm sending uh and yeah so we're gonna keep doing it you're gonna
keep seeing good examples I hope and for tonight though I hope you asked some
some questions so I can answer them if you send 50 of these and still can
get three responses it's still better than click and play it really is yeah

01:38
what if they all respond then I got a wonderful month
what are your desired salary expectations for this role uh fair
market rate for developer of my skill set and experience
well Leon what is the fair market rate for developer of your skills and
experience come on Bob I know you do this all day every day uh what have you
budgeted for this role uh should we always try to email over
LinkedIn message so we can attach our signature with our links that Stephanie
says uh oh like might be wrong like the emails
might be the wrong email so if the LinkedIn messages are open they seem
active on their LinkedIn I start there if I don't get a response then I move on
to email yeah I was so overwhelmed you made it look
fun yeah I I like to have fun with this I like I try not to take this part of
the process too seriously I try to just have some fun with it I try to find cool

01:39
ends like and I think the really important thing here is every single
person I've messaged I'm generally interested in like I would love to have
conversations with all five of these folks that I that I put out there right
like I I think that would be a really I think it should be fun conversations
right like I found something interesting about each of these folks that I would
like to learn about and if I can go into this process having a little bit of fun
meeting cool people at the end of the day I get to network with a few more
folks that I would have never had a chance to talk to that's good
and the more you kind of get comfortable with that the easier this process can
become I have 11 so far and I live in Atlanta a turn up
if the job description says 110 to 150 how do you deal with it if they offer a

01:40
minimum uh go to the bank and count my money uh go on a vacation
buy whatever I want off of Amazon eat out 110 all day let's go
but no we we negotiate right and we talk a lot about this during the
tea spills and if you come to stand up as folks start getting offers stand up
really does become me talking with them to help them negotiate so the beauty of
stand up as we get deeper into the hunt standup becomes way more actionable in
terms of like Leon I just got an offer helped me negotiate and then you'll hear
me negotiate live with somebody that has
a real offer uh if they came in with the minimum my response would be hey I'm so
excited to work at this company uh I could really see myself growing here

01:41
over the next uh 10 to 15 years two to three next three to five years as
you know I am currently in the process with X
number of companies is there any wiggle room on this starting salary
that's it I had to send that out uh and then often and not they'll
counter without any kind of hesitation especially if they've already given that
range uh and then I just kind of work off of that counter the best thing you
can do is then get another offer in that time frame and you can get the top of
the um top of the list we also shared the template that um
uh Daddy Yankee Nick shared and they showed exactly how they negotiated their
offer uh you can use that template as well we actually need to add that
template to the templates a lot of really good information being
shared that we'll we'll keep adding to the templates
if you folks ever asked to know more details about other offers you're using

01:42
for leverage they can ask all they want but typically I'll say I I actually
don't know what I've signed in part of this like interview process I'm not sure
if it's really under NDA or anything so I don't feel comfortable sharing the
details can I tell everyone that I got other offers even if I have none uh some
people play the the dangerous dance of the dangerous dance some people do
it's up to you how you want to play the game I'm not here to tell you how to
live your life I'm going to show you some ways if you want to play the game
that way that's up to you I I have no shame in mind game

01:43
but that that's that's not a call I can make for you
Kelly said well I can't match that so good luck that's why you never given
that's why I never answered that question you notice I never said that I I got a
higher offer right I always say I have other offers is there any wiggle room in
your offer because this is the place I want to work
when you say wiggle room and you like go
out of your way to like hype them up and
say this is where you want to be this is the place you see yourself growing
unless they're just like a horrible person they're gonna have some level of
empathy and go actually this is the top of our range we would
love to work with you but there's nothing we can do right they're not
gonna be like ah get out like that it's and if they did then that you do you
know that you were walking into a horrible company

01:44
are the Angelus salary estimates fairly accurate um sometimes they are
uh a lot of times it's the company that enters them in so if they're recent and
you actually if their profile is like actually pretty well filled out
and there's an actual contact person I find that it tends to be a little more
accurate like like just having talent but this is a bigger company if it's a
smaller company with a real person you can talk to that means they probably put
it in and it's pretty pretty solid all right so those are five that were local
we are going to take our break because we're at the top of the hour and when we
come back we're going to do globally remote companies so we're going to find
five companies that hire folks that live anywhere in the world and see if we can
find uh folks to talk to those companies to get in front of them so that we are
not clickers uh and we'll take it from there

01:45
all right so here's a list that I've used uh it's just and you can Define these
it's just it's like not something that um is super hard but there are there are
some lists that list these types of higher from anywhere doesn't matter
where you live type companies which I think can help a lot of folks that
aren't uh kind of in North America that aren't kind of like us or kinetic
Canadia specific uh and so I'm gonna throw this in here this is
just one of them no the ones that I share the ones that I share are um
well everyone's going to be using them and there's what like 1300 of us right
here right now so I'm not gonna I'm always gonna use this
one so that I don't saturate the others but you can find tons of these right
uh you can find tons of these types of lists uh because if you are global um

01:46
or you work you want to work globally not every company that is remote
right every company that is remote actually hires folks from anywhere so
it's actually it it's actually a little bit more challenging to find those types
of companies there are tons of ways to find remote jobs I just find that a lot
of folks sometimes struggle because even though they're remote they still expect
you to work in certain countries uh and so even if you're like on um
Angel list you can go ahead and turn this remote include remote jobs
um and it will have remote jobs in North America right it's still like
labels it for North America um and then it increases like look how
many results we just jumped up to 5 000 right so in this case what I would do is
if I turned on remote right and I knew that I was in an area

01:47
that typically hires coders right uh so they don't have to deal with tax
implications and labor laws yeah it's that's true there are actually tools now
that make it a little bit easier so more
car more cars more companies are opening up to live anywhere work for them
um because there are companies that make payroll actually manageable that handle
the taxes for you basically there are payroll companies now that are a
registered agent in every country and so you hire someone and then the company
that you pay pays the workers in every and where you wherever they may be so
they handle all the labor law stuff they handle all the tax implications and on
your end you're just you're just using a service [Music] um
I think when digital nomadism first started they didn't realize that even if
you were a digital Nomad you were still quite privileged if you had a passport

01:48
from a specific country that had defined
labor laws that countries could actually
apply like that could you could work for so someone that was a digital Nomad for
two plus years um I think that was kind of lost in that whole movement yeah cool
all right uh so just real quick before we look at the global list uh I still
have my normal full stack front-end back-end software engineer in my La we
turned on remote North America this is what I would add filters so I'm now
going to look for JavaScript cool I want to look for node
and I'm going to look for node without the JS there you go without the DOT
cool I would start with just those those are some areas of interest uh I'm going

01:49
to exclude keywords like senior when I exclude keywords like lead staff
principle manager director yeah um probably like Sr I don't want to do
that let low um why exclude senior just because this
is a lot of this is still 718 results there's no way
right there's no way that I can like it's just gonna be I would just be doing
this for years if I was to go to all these companies so why not Niche down if
I am trying to increase my odds right I spelled principle wrong I did

01:50
I spelled it [Laughter] uh yeah this is just an exercise I might
even go as far as it's like the the size of companies that I want like maybe
like maybe no small companies I don't know
where does that get me so yeah they're like one to ten employees maybe I don't
for this for my first pass right right for my first pass
right not for my first pass right if I knew that I was gonna go harder
then I would I would leave these on right because that just opens me up to
even more but I might leave them off just because there might be more chance
that they're actually hiring um and then I view results right and now
I got 350 results to dig through that are remote and I would just do this
process until my fingers fell off all right look at all these jobs all

01:51
right but that doesn't work for everyone because even though the remote they
probably still want me to be in America and pay me in American dollars that's
what I like about lists like this uh is that they are they are a list of
companies that doesn't matter where you work uh you can reach out to them so
let's go and take a look at this list um gitlab buffer automatic these are some
like big name companies um I know I did some of these before so I'm
gonna try and like jump down further uh the tried different ones that I have
maybe I didn't do last time dollar Flight Club cool
no current openings that are listed that wouldn't stop me though

01:52
even if folks don't list openings uh it doesn't matter engineering
web engineer freelance all regions web engineer all regions hello yeah
human made what do they do Enterprise WordPress agency rip I'd still apply uh
uh hopping is popping let's see what do they got
remote team do they got open positions does it list anything
uh engineering manager senior I might still reach out to these folks

01:53
uh do they have any they have a angel list profile is there a way for me to no
um jobs cannot search jobs let's look for Hoppin
actually I'm just gonna go to LinkedIn it might be easier pop in cool people uh
so I mean for me I have a lot of connections to folks that are in sales

01:54
product leader Revenue vice president I like that this seems like somebody
that's fun pop in here vice president founder product leader
at a corporate development I'm gonna go with the person that calls them a
Hopping ear that just seems fun oh president and board member all right
anyway let's shoot our shot no open messages uh any contact info
Twitter is open they've opened DMs no open DMs uh they might be too high up for

01:55
they're a big enough company that I might not go for by that high up
uh let's see fails sometimes they don't have a recruiter on here say hop in
truder looking for anything let's see hop in angel
Co let's see the angel list profile they do okay
here we go we have their Angelus profile much better

01:56
um do they have any people listed here all right ahead of people and culture
that could be somebody I might reach out to
how many people are they they're a big company all right let's see
experienced in recruitment kind of people and culture Talent acquisition
all right can I find anything about them their LinkedIn is here
I actually have a website listed is this their website
maybe they sell stuff that'd be interesting uh let's check their LinkedIn
and messages are open boom there we go I would start here
uh they're pretty high up director Global people operations coach and mentor

01:57
promoting diversity inclusion practices cool seems like somebody I'd want to
talk to looking at kind of if there's anything I can latch on to here
I might be overthinking it uh they have a Twitter yeah they have a Twitter
open DMS on Twitter that's that's also dope Barcelona
uh I might I might do DMS on Twitter before I do DMS on LinkedIn uh and the
reason why is because they're LinkedIn um might be jumping
right they're they're they're they're their LinkedIn might be might be jumping

01:58
um I might try something cheeky let's look up sports ball recently

01:59
they went Ronaldo back see I'm trying to show you like what I would
actually look up I don't know to be a good player messy messy messed up
I'm trying to think of like is there like an in I see the other thing I know
about Barcelona is football uh and they might not even care about
that all right that's probably not a good in let's see if they have anything
on their Twitter oh tweets are protected what is this site though that they link
can I do Google Translate we sell products without bulk in bulk

02:00
without Plastics and without waste that's dope
all right I'll do that my DM would start with this um
how can I turn this into a DM let's go here uh this would be a DM that
I do on Twitter I always start with that uh hey
I have too many tabs open this is this is one of the downsides of
getting too deep into the hunt all right uh I have been obsessed with reducing

02:01
all of my plastic waste until it fits in a jar ever
since I saw this video and then I would link to the video of the woman that was
Zero waste and fit it on the jar uh I gotta I got to find the video so when
you're when with these Global remote companies whenever you're applying to
remote jobs since you are not local you are competing against more folks
right you're competing against more folks thank you Game everyone your
competing against more folks and so you have to be a little bit more out there
right you have to be a little bit more you gotta go a little extra and so
building out a global hiring anywhere um

02:02
Global hiring anywhere type job you kind of gotta shoot your shot a little bit
harder all right I've been obsessed with reducing my own
Pathways until if it's in a driver since I saw this video Phil Hoffman has open
engineering roles and love to learn more about them or just talk zero waste I
love what you're doing with and I would link their company uh also if it
makes sense to talk to someone else I would appreciate the intro
or actually I wouldn't say that I would let them say that talking to doing with
have a great week cheers Leon all right so trying to connect with them
all right trying to connect this would be a this would be a message I would

02:03
send through Twitter DM because their DMS were open right DMS were open
so I would just send them a Twitter DM I've been obsessed with reducing all my
plastic waste until it fits and jar since I was saw this video I thought it
was open engineering Rose let's learn more about them or just talk zero waste
I love what you're doing with blank have a great week boom that's what I would
send uh so this is Hoppin we gotta we gotta close some of these windows hopping
uh I forget where the site here it is the site careers um
the person I'm talking to where's their Twitter there we go copy that Twitter

02:04
put it in here boom there we go one of my five remote
I'm just going to clean this up a little bit all right there we go cool
if you think those tabs are bad you should see my other monitor [Laughter]
all right who else Duck Duck Go I actually know a lot of people that
work at duck duck duck duck duck go um I would probably just reach out to
the folks I know that work there um looks like mainly senior roles they're

02:05
kind of like later stage it's a company that you all like if you
see a company that should click on you tell me
help Scout I know the founders of help scale oh Lark let's check out olart
uh cool olark open positions doesn't say anything open right now
let's try clothes software engineer back in a little bit of react
uh looks like it's python though did you have react roles though this would be
this would be something I would still I would still reach out to uh close
dot com let's see if they have an angel list account angel.com closed

02:06
this is gonna be hard to find um no no why can I just look up
companies directly can I close here we go all right beautiful
do they list somebody I can talk to we do have the software engineering role
here yeah it's a little python I can learn some python um
we don't list the person that you can talk to
let's look at all their team members closes on your list that's awesome
uh uh founder founder founder Senior People operations that might be the

02:07
person we go to senior back-end engineer people operations come on no recruiter
me recruiter good this size you should give me a recruiter
nah all right let's see director of engineering might be the
person I reach out to First director of engineering product
oh they got everything listed let's see LinkedIn what you got for me

02:08
10 second warning five second warning difficult [Music]
I see we can find out about them we'll see if we can find out about them um
they write about their work we're hiring it's great so they're they're saying
we're all we're all they're hiring uh let's look at their like their history
Zend University of Florida Yahoo Google they're a freelancer for a long time

02:09
they have a gap yeah 2007 2010 looks like they freelance for a large
period of time does this have another date 2015 or were they here earlier
oh they're on the founding team of clothes okay
it's still that's that's still three years where they were um freelancing
or at least yeah at least three years were there freelancing right am I not
seeing it right seven freelancing and then Quizlet founding team out of product
and engineering all right I think I could use that as an

02:10
Outreach and then also look at their blog notice I'm spending a little bit
more time with these people than I wear with the other ones when you're looking
for these Global remote it's you gotta you gotta do a little more
their DMS are open here on Twitter too looks like they'd be open to a Twitter DM
um I would I'm going to use that I would I would send them
I would send them an email because they give me the email we just check their

02:11
blog out real quick all right I'm gonna use that all right
I'm gonna send them an email because they literally gave us the email um uh free

they have one cool let's see oh this is weird because I know these people like
we'll skip I know I know uh hope Scott went through techstars
um around the same time that I did uh let's go ahead and do uh

02:18
hot jar are they still a thing oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're hiding a lot
software engineer full stack JavaScript let's go
all right let's see if Hot jar has a angel list cool um
they list let's go to people they list any jobs they have jobs
not listed on here we're always hiring I love to see that
all right let's look at their people real quick
um employee employee tech support lead head of engineering software engineer um
former team Maybe you could reach out to software engineer
or head of engineering do they have anything listed on their profile

02:19
even about me that's no longer there about their LinkedIn
empathetic cat software uh so it looks like they're no longer at hotjar okay
um check out their LinkedIn software engineer at hot jar they've
been there for three years no open messages
um but I think they're they didn't nope a GitHub check out their GitHub profile
found their Twitter no open messages um all right that was a bus no open

02:20
Messages open DMS no LinkedIn messages um let's try LinkedIn hot jar
look for people VP of engineering software engineering team lead that
could be good I'm just looking for recruitment
director of town acquisition there we go let me start with that

02:21
how acquisition partner what's accelerate accelerate
account acquisition lead at hotjar I'm gonna I might hit these these two I
don't know what an associate Talent partner might be it might be like a
specific recruiter um but this is a talent acquisition lead
um open Messages we're hiring let's go all right what do we know about them
oh Make A Wish Foundation I also volunteer for Make-A-Wish
um I might leave with that [Music] um should not make a wish

02:22
um let's get something else uh nothing really here
just uh they like definitely do recruiting okay
do they have anything else listed no this one's hard
but open messages so I would shoot my shot um
let's see if we can find anything else real quick
we live in Italy and that could be uh [Music] up up
nah I don't say anything we'll just do a generic generic they got open messages

02:23
see let's look at their Activity real quick um they post it all no
no we're looking at their let me look at their posts
all right so this looks like likes all right they got open Messages let's shoot
her a shot let's send a message um try the VP of engineering I think I
would if I if I was really doing this I would definitely go to the VP of

02:24
engineering um uh what does hot jar even do let's look at hot jar real quick
oh yeah this has probably been around forever heat Maps
uh I would build some sort of heat map applique I would just build something
really quickly it was like a heat map uh let's do like um heat open source
Source heat map JavaScript Heat map.js all right boom I would grab something
like this I built I would add a heat map
to my binary upload boom or my 100 hours
project and that would be my way in so I send a message

02:25
and my message would be like I love heat Maps hey what is your name again Angela
I saw that hot jar had open engineering rolls on on your company website
and I recently built out heat Maps for one of my projects I would love
to connect to learn uh I would love to learn more about your open engineering

02:26
roles please let me know if you ever have a few minutes to chat
Angela I saw that hot jar had open engineering roles in your company
website every Heat match for one of my projects boom I'll link to it
I would love to learn more about Open engineering roles so this is a global
remote company we really gotta shoot our shot would you happen to have a
few minutes next week to chat if so just name a time and I'll move

02:27
mountains to make it work have a great rest viewer week cheers yeah there you go
love Moving Mountains they do all right cool I love heat Maps
I'm gonna click on it you're gonna click on I don't care
hey Angela I saw that hot jar had open engineering roles uh on your company
website and I recently built that heat maps for one of my projects I'd love to
learn more about opening uh your open rolls
would you happen to have a few minutes next week to chat if so just name a time
and I'll move mountains make it work cover grassy week cheers boom all right
uh super simple we didn't really we couldn't really find anything to kind of
like latch onto um but this is kind of like one of the
generic things that you can you can you can do uh like you can just add
something that their product is tangential to it would take you like
what 10-15 minutes to add that open source heat map to your um

02:28
to your project and then you would move on right hot jar talking to Angela
what's her name yeah Angela cool and I would like linked
all the stuff that we found uh let's look at another Global remote one here
dockyard Stockyard nope it's modern tribe
calling all curious problem solvers sign me up uh [Music]
so see it's a little bit it's a little bit harder when you're not going through
a job board that already has like the open roles uh maybe something we could
do that would speed this up would be if we used our Google magic that we learned

02:29
from previous classes and just added all these companies to it
right that's probably makes that probably makes more sense gitlab
engineering cool I got a lot of open roles uh
uh let's see if they have an angel list profile cool
I don't have a person listed look at all the team members

02:30
just looking I always look for recruiters first
senior technical recruiter all right Liam come on give me something I can work
with worked at gitlab are you still you're no longer there oh you're still here
boom all right let's see your profile says you got a
lot of stuff here we can work with uh uh let's go back let's actually take a
look at their profile real quick did they go to university yeah I guess

02:31
public speaker their Master care is at um get lab boom
let's look at their profile gitlab does not use recruitment agencies
so we have a large internal team cool crossfitting
festival or getting out into nature all right we got we can hook onto any of
these uh writing crossfitting Festival so like right off the bat
right right off the bat you could you could if you if you if you have any
attachment to any of these um you could use that as your link in
uh messages are not open they don't have their Twitter linked

02:32
uh was there Twitter on here no so we're probably just gonna go with email since
they are a recruiter um they probably would have LinkedIn
we could talk about dni work that would probably be my in here but what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
try and email them so let's go to Hunter and do gitlab
let's see what it looks like it looks like first letter last name
yeah pretty clear the first letter last name so my email let's grab their John

02:33
over here it would be Al McNally is what I would start with cool all right
getlab.com all right yeah it looks like it's coming up boom um
and let's just say hey Liam and is CrossFit best of all going out to Nature
let's see uh uh Festival will probably be the best
like like talk about like a recent Festival I think something funny about
crossfitting could be had uh I'm telling you when you're doing these

02:34
with global remote you gotta stand out I got lost in the woods hey Liam
I saw that uh I saw that get lab had open roles and I wanted to Reach Out
add open engineering roles and I wanted to reach out I promise my engineering
talents are out pace my orienteering tiering skills cool
hey Liam I saw it open engineering rules and I wanted to reach out across my

02:35
engineer transparent Pace my orienting Orient hearing skills you would you
do you have any time this month to chat about working at gitlab or
not getting lost in the woods all of us have a great week cheers Leon
cool here we go um let me go with I noticed you

02:36
what do they say on on their on their LinkedIn
I notice you like getting out to Nature but like they're not completely like
what the heck's going on all right oh Liam Leon coincidence I think not
that could be a good one all right I got lost in the woods they're
definitely clicking that I don't care how many emails that they get uh they're
definitely clicking that hey Liam I saw that gitler had open engineering roles
and wanted to reach out I promised my engineering talents far outpace my
orienteering skills the only time I just want to chat but we're gonna get low
we're not getting lost in the woods I know she like getting out to Nature on
LinkedIn have a great week cheers Leon uh wouldn't this come across as creepy
no we passed creepy exactly we're so past creepy it's not creepy folks

02:37
Oh wrong one it's networking and so you got to get out of your head
you got to get out of your head you're sending a hundred and eighty of these if
it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't who cares
we're just trying to We're just trying to get them to open our messages right
the biggest problem is that folks can't get in front of the people that can that
can connect you right you can't lose a job you don't have stop overthinking it
have some fun write some funny messages right Find Your Way in winners win
losers lose you gotta find your way in right and so this is the way you can
find your way in so I like this one I got lost in the woods would be our
title and I think this is where we'll um we'll call it we got nine out of ten

02:38
when we come back on Tuesday uh we're gonna go hard we're gonna we're gonna
try and get 30 of these in one session uh so I was trying to show you a little
bit more of like what I would do how I'd reach out to folks and I hope that it's
been helpful to kind of see the approach I would take to reaching out to these
very real people uh trying to get them to open my messages trying to get them
to to give me the time of day uh but that's kind of it
yeah key takeaway here is have fun with it you can't lose a job you don't have
exactly uh you people put too much pressure on themselves at this point in
the process and and that's pretty sad because you're when you're overthinking
it you're not sending messages when you're not sending messages you're not
opening up the doors that could help you get the job so please just try it it's
one out of 180 some of them are gonna fall flat some of them will will never
be opened um but you're right there in the end all

02:39
right everybody have a wonderful rest of your night hope this was some fun at
least hope you start to see the intention behind the message that I send
hopefully getting folks to click hopefully getting folks to start looking
at your application not being a Clicker [Laughter]
