00:00
oh today's the day folks let's go we online hey oh we'll let it go
we'll let it go tonight a a oh [Music] good morning good afternoon good evening
no matter where you're coming from hope you are doing well
welcome folks welcome welcome welcome welcome
hope you're doing well today's a good day you know what today is a good good day

00:01
i'm super excited you know what like that song comes on i don't know
something takes over there's a there's a leon before stream
and then there's a leon on stream and it's that song i don't know it gets me
going what's going on everybody uh somebody you're in here early too
what's up what's up hey come on in everybody alrighty it's provocative exactly
well everybody say what's the news what's the news we you know we we always
we have a pattern folks we got we got to
build up to the news we we online we got to build up to it so as always
uh tonight is a special night we got the biggest news ever folks it's coming
we got the biggest news ever uh we're getting into objects which are for me
objects where it starts to get fun uh once we learn a little bit of objects
tonight next week is fire we get we actually get to build with like apis and

00:02
and it becomes real i don't know i like one of the biggest things i think for
students early on is this idea that like yes we're accumulating like all these
legos right we have variables we have functions we have loops we have
conditionals we have arrays but like how do we like put those legos together to
build stuff and until you start building it's it's really hard to to see the
results of your effort and so once we add this last lego block your your
mind's gonna be blown like the things you'll be able to start building are out
of this world so super pumped for the best news ever
super pumped for us to add that last lego brick which is objects and
we got lots of review tonight as well so we're gonna be reviewing some of our
array stuff uh practicing with some of those methods that we haven't really had
a chance to play with yet then we're jumping into objects that better

00:03
understand what the heck those methods are and we got the best news ever cool
you know we always like to start off with some questions
if you got questions i possibly got answers
tonight's question of the day if you uh well today's question of the day
is would you rather be an expert in bird watching
or insect identification so say bird or insect in chat for me please bird or
insect first question what's the news oh i thought insects would blow out i'm
into birds i'll say it loud i'm into birds
i spent a good portion of today watching some crows i'm into birds it's a thing
but i like my bugs too i like my bugs too bird up
wow bird really i'm well versed in bird law i'm not a lawyer but i i know a
little bit uh enough so that you're gonna need a warrant to legally search my

00:04
words i guess if it's bird law right birds all right i think birds blew this one
out there's a there's a few insect folks holding out but i think i think uh
i think birds blew this one out the water all right thank you i tell you i love
seeing these answers these are like this is how i get to know you all
insects is important to know your enemy alrighty other questions questions this
evening rossi said are you announcing the group
project winners we'll get to that we'll get to that we'll get to that i got you
i watched the video on how to make friends with crows and so i'm trying it
i'm trying to make friends with my my local crew my local crows there's a
there there is a there is like a like a pair like a bonded pair that i see every
every day so i'm gonna make friends with
them and i think there's like a juvenile crew that's like a block over trying to

00:05
make friends with them too i want them looking out for me you know
i want i want my birds you know flying around making sure i'm good
all right you got questions i got answers
what's the meaning of life the universe and everything 42
what do you think of the ending of the most recent bachelor i don't want to
spoil i also may not have finished yet get some my water in
what should we do if we haven't found a freelance client yet and i don't know if
we will before the due date don't fear on thursday we're going to talk through
some alternatives to getting a client so for a lot of folks getting a client's
not actually like a possibility uh either you have visa issues you're in an

00:06
area that prohibits it from actually happening you're in a space where you
just can't do it so on thursday we're going to talk through some other things
that you can do that will get you similar benefits to the client so if
you're really stressing over the client thursday i got you
superman no home hey thank you for the gift of subs thank you for being here
yeah so know that we do have that that date coming very soon i want you to
push yourself this this whole process is
about pushing you pushing yourself right um i i want you to always take yourself
a little bit further than you think you can go that's the goal it's a boot camp
right a boot camp is meant to push you you're not supposed to feel super
comfortable the whole way through that would be like a udemy course i don't know
you're meant to push yourself right you're meant to to feel at some times
that things aren't going your way sometimes you're supposed to feel the

00:07
muck that is the trough of sorrow sometimes you're you're you're supposed
to be in that reading doing one of these all right
what i just read that four times i just read that four times what
what those aren't words those can't be words all right
you're you're you're focused you're supposed to feel that right that's a
part of a boot camp because through that struggle through carrying those boats
through carrying those logs you start to grow a little bit of a thicker skin
the things that used to be really troublesome start to feel a little bit easier
and you're going to have days where you're winning and you're going to have
days where it doesn't feel the same but through the process
you you you pick up some skills you pick up techniques that you didn't have
before and then when you're on the job and you have to learn something

00:08
no sweat right no sweat that's the whole point the whole
point is to build yourself up enough so that when you're in the job and they're
throwing new materials at you news new languages new things at you you're like
i've been there done that this is this ain't no thing i read eloquent
javascript you know what i read eloquent javascript this ain't no sweat i went
through that book if i can make it through that book you ain't got nothing
to throw at me right so it's a boot camp some days are gonna
feel tough that's okay that is okay that's a good thing embrace the suck
open up that closet get in there fight your demons right and then ask for help
all right this it's a boot camp we're here to carry
some boats and logs but you got to ask for help too and you got to realize that
not everything is going to be your thing right there are gonna be some some
examples that just don't click that's okay

00:09
you you have a bunch of other resources i never just give you one thing
right i never just give you one thing right there's always other things to
help boost you up we come to class we fill it out so it's okay
and one thing we have to remember as we're going through this process
yes it's a bootcamp yes we're here to push ourselves yes we're here to get in
the muck and ask a metric crap ton of questions
but we always have to keep in mind health first okay
this is something that i i asked the last cohort to really embody i asked
them for it to be to be a a thing that they brought up
constantly with each other and i don't ever want this to be like a mocking
thing i really want this to be something that a hundred devs embodies
right the idea that health comes first we're 21 classes in

00:10
jeff and hey thank you for the 10 gifted subs congrats on the new gig too
cool these jobs folks these jobs jeff and a thank you for the for the 10
gift itself hope you're doing well we're 21 classes in it's starting to get real
it's starting to get real we got reading we got doing
we got cold wars we got networking we got class to show up to we got office
hours to come to it it's really starting to build and uh oh yeah 21 21 21.
what we have to realize is that our health has to come first right
we've been doing this for a while right we're doing this for a while
we got to start taking care of ourselves better we have to make sure that we're
doing our stretches you're taking care of your hands you're taking care of your
eyes you're taking care of your shoulders right you're
you're realizing that we're still got a long way to go
and that fatigue is going to start setting in and that fatigue is what's

00:11
going to stop you from getting to the end it may not be your will it may not
be the actual learning but the fatigue the tiredness that starts to set in and
the only way to get through that is to put your health first it's okay
to take a day and not come to class it's okay
the the vods are always here they always make it up to youtube right
make sure if you need a day to sleep to eat to hydrate
to let that fatigue wear off that's okay this is a marathon not a sprint
please as we get deeper into it take care of your hands take care of
your body stretch hydrate do the things that we say when we take the breaks
during class time actually take the breaks and if you ever need a day a week
you can take it we have the catch-up crew you can always catch up and join us

00:12
live there's no reason in burning yourself out and you know what it's okay
if there's ever an assignment i give you and you're like leon this is too much
for me in the moment put it to the side that's okay
if if eloquent javascript took you to the brink and you're like it's just not
worth it i want to be able to continue put it to the side
it's not gospel right you can take the things that you need in the moment and
pick up the breast as you need to go forward all right so always put your health
first cool and and and bring this into the cohort
right when people are stressing when people are are are at a in a place we
know that they could probably be prioritizing the health bring it up
don't ever do it in a mocking way but let's let this be something that we embody
coding challenges some folks have been diving deep some

00:13
folks have been spinning out these coding challenges are uh
taking the best of us so coding challenges i'm addicted yeah some
people go in all of them they're fun i know if you don't if if you haven't seen
the fun in them yet give yourself a little time they can be really fun they
can be something that winds up being like it's like you're it's like it's
like nerdy crossword puzzles right it even nerdier crossword puzzles they can
be fun you got to get into them and you got to make them part of your daily
practice and the very first couple times you do
your coding challenges they can really suck if you've never done them before so
we brought this up during office hours but please
make sure you are doing level eight make sure you are doing the eight cues
make sure you're doing the fundamentals track rockefeller a
make sure you're doing the fundamentals track if you're not doing a cues and

00:14
you're not doing fundamentals you're off doing some wild stuff right
right you're you're off doing you're you're off doing some wild stuff you
need to be on eight queues you need to be on fundamentals and you're gonna be
there for a while okay if you're trying to do anything else
it's too much now the first time you do code wars
you're almost never going to understand how it works or what to do you're going
to look at the question you're going to go what
if in that moment you have no idea how you're going to even approach the topic
just look at the solution there you're there's no such thing as
cheating there's no such thing as like like i i it's just it's just so weird

00:15
just look at the solution you're here to learn the reason we do code wars
not is not because like we we just want to do something no it's because we're
here to learn so if you're looking at a problem and
you have no idea how you're gonna solve it it makes no sense to sit there for an
hour banging your head against the keyboard when you could look at the
solution and then spend more time on the
analysis than you did on trying to solve and that's how you learn to become a
lean mean interviewing machine when you see these problems and you have no idea
how to even get started make just look at the solution then spend more time
analyzing the solution typing it out re-typing it out re-typing it out doing
it again looking at the question without the code pulled up make sure you can
pass it right spend more time on the analysis and practice than you did on
trying to solve it and eventually after you do a few right
now after you do a few right after you do a few the

00:16
it gets easier you start to understand how things play out you start to see the
same patterns and so the code wars is really about patterns and so until you
have those patterns look at the solution please and then make sure you're doing
ones where you can see the patterns over
and over again so like once you start to come out of fundamentals only do array
problems then only do object problems only do the things that you want to
practice in that moment so you see those patterns over and over again okay
but don't don't don't beat yourself up if the code wars don't click the first
couple that you do look at the solution spend more time in analysis than you do
on the solving and that's how you grow on sunday we talked about chess grand
masters and i i think this is important to bring up again because i know people
are in the thick of it right now people that are really good at chess
like grandmasters at chess like the best
competitive chess players they don't get better at chess by playing more chess

00:17
i think that's a weird thing for most folks like they don't get better at chess
by playing more chess they get better at chess by analyzing
their games or other games right they spend more time looking at all right
here's what this person did then they did this and they did that then they did
this and then they did that all right and i see this pattern that's that that
can lead to that right you spend more time on the analyzing than you do
on the actual playing it's the same thing for your code wars in the
beginning spend more time analyzing even if you get the code wars right
look at the other solutions what did they do how did they do it in less lines
how did they do it more efficiently right the end the analysis is more
important than the solving in the beginning so spend time looking at your
solution other solutions and make sure you understand how they're doing and
approaching things and that's how you really grow very quickly

00:18
at the stage that you're at right now the more you put into code wars
the more you're going to get out of the next chunk of class because code wars
forces you to put all the things that we're learning into practice it's really
hard to see all these lego bricks and not know what to do with them code wars
forces you to use them and so your code wars combined with projects that we'll
do on that we'll do in class that's the cheat codes cool
super pumped when i wrote a proper arrow function today on the js30 homework hey
it's awesome two times beautiful 2 30 not for a while
alrighty uh we're getting ready to have a live portfolio and resume review
session if you would like to have one of your
resumes and portfolios reviewed live fill out this form i'm going to pick a a
big handful of folks i'll kind of give you a slight little roast but through

00:19
that roasting we can see all the things that we think
portfolios and resumes should have and we'll do it in a constructive way and
hopefully you walk away with a really good idea of how to structure your
portfolio and resume for the next stage of program now folks
we're turning things up we got through the big four we got
through our variables our functions our conditionals our loops we added arrays
we're going to get some practice to raise today but then we're adding
objects once we add objects we're dangerous folks we're real
dangerous we're real dangerous right we're real dangerous once we have
objects we're going to start using apis we're going to start being able to get
data from other places and manipulating that data showing it to our users
building larger projects that are actually really freaking cool all right
and then we move into the back end so we we got some we got some some objects to

00:20
do to start building some real meaty projects some projects that are going to
be in your portfolio hopefully for the rest of your life
we're turning it up a little bit turn it up you know how we do we always get a
review in we always make sure that we we we we keep progressing at a good pace
but our projects are going to get better the things that we're able to do are
going to get better um and so even though we're in the trough of sorrow
right even though we're in the muck it gets
eventually if you're rolling around in the mud enough
you start to have some fun with it right if you're rolling around in the
muck you start to have some fun with you start to build some mud castles right
right that's what we're gonna be we're gonna be in the muck we're gonna be in
that trough of sorrow we're gonna have some fun with it we're gonna build some
really cool stuff while we're in the middle of that muck and i i guarantee
next week and the week after it just it just gets a lot more fun like the the
practicality of what you can do and build and work with real data build real

00:21
projects that's that's when it becomes a lot of fun so you put in the work let's
see that work come to fruition and start building some really cool stuff in the
next couple of classes what about react we do back end first
and then add react at the end so that way we can build full stack web
applications and then see what react adds into that into that mix for us
jonathan said eloquent js equals trough of sorrow code wars equals wiggles of
false hope uh we're we're we're nowhere near the wiggles of falsehood but i like
the analogy no alrighty kind of talked about this a bit
but we all we have the legos now we have all these different lego pieces we got
our variables our functions our loops our conditionals our arrays then we add

00:22
objects now we have the pieces we can start the build and so for folks that um
feel like uh they have all these pieces but don't
know what to do with them your code wars
help and then the next couple of clashes up we're gonna build some cool stuff
you're gonna see how these lego pieces come together so if you need a bigger
picture it's coming trust me it's coming but we needed the
legos we needed the legos before we could put it all together
now we can build exactly alrighty folks the moment we've all waited for
the big news now i put my warning up here i'll try to
keep the warning uh in the future for whenever we use this like this code party
section um but next next next slide is is gonna be loud
because we got some big news so i'm gonna go over here to the big news and
then we're gonna hit it so in the next few next 10 seconds or so

00:23
we're going to have some some confetti some loud sounds so late 2020
i had an idea it was a pandemic and i wasn't a doctor i wasn't a nurse
so i didn't know what i could do to help
but i had an idea i said you know what i think i can
i think i can help a few folks maybe become software engineers
and so we did a very small cohort of folks and hundreds of people showed up
i was really expecting 10 folks here with me on twitch and that that was it
and then that first like five week course we were like holy crap
we might be able to do this thing we might be able to teach a class live
online we online folks maybe we could teach a class maybe we
could teach it online and maybe we could we could build a community of folks

00:24
that uh that could go to distance that could learn how to code that could
build some phenomenal projects that could get some phenomenal clients and
could uh maybe get some jobs and so we did that first run
and then in the second run we set well at least i set the biggest
goal of my life one of the biggest goals of my life one of the things that i've
ever like one of the biggest goals i've ever put out there publicly and said
i want to do this thing right i want to do this thing nobody
else has done this thing i want to do this thing
right nobody is ever done a completely free coding bootcamp online put
everything out there for free and in the public and i set a goal
and the goal is the namesake of our bootcamp our agency

00:25
and the goal is a hundred devs and i'm here to say 100 learning how to code
[Music] i'm gonna take it [Music] i'll save our ears but we did it we hit over

00:26
a hundred jobs over a hundred jobs we're not at a hundred we're over a hundred
a hundred software engineering jobs and a whole smattering of other jobs that
are in the related field as well but a hundred folks that came to a hundred devs
and got the support they needed to learn to grow and to get a job as a software
engineer we threw out into the world the idea
that a hundred thousand a hundred jobs and we smashed through it
we smashed through it we got our hundred we got more than a hundred
we got folks going to some amazing companies amazing jobs we got folks
going to uh the the the the companies around the block those are my favorite
where they they can walk to work we got some folks going to really great
startups we got some folks going to fang we got some folks that

00:27
never even thought about code but saw a freaking post on reddit
and now they're making six figures we had some folks where their whole
family came where the husband and wife came and they both learned together and
now they're both employed we got folks that are in
dozens of countries that have gotten jobs our first job was somebody from
brazil our second was somebody from the uk and it kept going around the world
a hundred jobs plus so we hit 100 but we're just getting started
we're just getting started so the best news ever is that we hit our hundred but
i think we got some big things coming our way

00:28
i think we got some amazing things to come our way i think we can do something
a little bigger maybe a little better maybe a little bit bigger maybe a little
bit better because let me let me let me throw some
numbers at you let me throw some numbers at you before i get to my thank yous
before i before i get there let me throw some numbers at you
when we were doing the original 100 devs like legit cohort
we had about 300 people that were watching the streams but really only 100
people were turning in the homework so all the homework you can see
is public this is something that's that's interesting like if you want to
see like who was really participating in 100 devs uh you can actually see all of
our all of our our homework assignments actually wind up being
on github so you can literally see the people that were submitting their
homework right so we had about 300 people on the stream

00:29
and we had about 100 people actually doing the homework and keeping up
we got over 100 jobs right we got over 100 jobs so for me the
folks that were keeping out doing the work i feel like we got a good a good a
good clip of them a good clip of the folks that were doing
the full work we got we got them right now we're seeing kind of similar things
with this cohort we got about 3 000 people that come up to to class about a
thousand plus they're doing every single bit of homework
right so for me i feel like if we if we can keep the same numbers
then we can keep the same numbers i think we might need to get a new goal
i think some things might need to change but before we get to that before we get
to that before we think about the things that might need to change i gotta i
gotta say some thank yous i gotta say some thank yous

00:30
because it didn't happen we didn't hit this hundred
we didn't hit this hundred by by accident this doesn't happen by accident
this happens through a lot of hard freaking work and it's not myself
it's not our fearless moderator crew it's not all these folks that help make
100 devs run at the beginning it's y'all it's your work
we can't make you show up we can't make you come to class
do the homework do the cold wars do the networking get the clients that's y'all
and so for the 100 folks that got jobs plus last cohort they showed up
time and time again they put in the work they put in the hours
they did the networking they did the portfolio building they

00:31
built their 100 hours projects they got their clients and at the end
all that hard work came together where a hundred plus people got some amazing
amazing jobs so the first people i need to thank are all of our alumni
all the folks that put in that work to make a hundred devs what it is for me to
be able to claim a hundred right i don't get to claim 100 unless you all
do the work so the first people i got to thank are y'all for showing up put in
the work and doing it because i can't claim that number unless you do the work
so thank you i really really do from the bottom of my heart thank every single
one of you that show up that give me a little bit of trust a little bit of time
i'm gonna get you there if you're here if you're if you're part of this cohort
i'm going to get you there give me a little bit of trust give me a little bit
of time i've now literally gotten hundreds of people jobs through this

00:32
program hundreds of people's jobs through this program and we're just getting
started now there are some other amazing folks that we have to thank and
my thank you is gonna be a little odd here because we're gonna do something
bigger right first and foremost i have to thank our
moderators our fearless moderators that are always here in
twitch chat on discord discord's the wild wild west y'all nobody's ever done
this nobody's ever thrown 28 000 people into a discord and have it run with the
level of success that we've had we went from like zero to 28 000 in less than a
year and so that to me is is absolutely wild well sorry we went from like 2 000
28 000 in less than a year so that if you've ever been on discord
and it wasn't a a hot mess if it wasn't run amok with trolls and spam
that's because of the moderator team and so i'm gonna thank each moderator

00:33
personally but tonight's that not that nice i have something bigger planned so
each mod i'm gonna thank individually because they deserve it
uh but that's not today that's gonna be it's gonna be it's gonna be and
something that we're gonna talk about in a few seconds
then i have to thank all of our mentors our helpers our folks that show up time
and time again to help folks in the community that answer questions in our
help channels to answer questions or support channels
this doesn't work without y'all too and then the biggest folks again the
alumni that are in those channels answering your questions giving up their
time they already went through the boot camp they have a job
and they come back on twitch on discord to continue to help the next group of
folks make it through that to me is the whole point of this
the whole point of this is not a hundred jobs
it's for those folks to now bring three more with them

00:34
so a hundred quickly turns into 300 and then i think we have some bigger goals
that we need to hit too and when i when we made that ask
we made the ask to our alumni hey come back can you help with the study
communities can you help with uh new events they answered the call every
single time and so a huge shout out to the alumni that come
back and give their time they made it to
the promised land they're coming back to pull more folks with you so
we thank you for being here we thank the alumni we thank the moderators we
thanked all of our helpers on discord but i want to do a little bit something
bigger i wanted i want to i want to do something a little bit bigger and
last cohort we did something that was one of my favorite parts of the cohort
and we're going to do it again i'm introducing
the best week ever now last cohort we had the best week ever but this cohort

00:35
we're really about to have the best week ever so next week will be the best week
ever we're gonna do some really amazing stuff
we got some things that people have been asking for a long time
we got merch dropping got agency opening up we got job board opening up we got
merch we got a sponsored class by microsoft
we got a lot of stuff folks that we got to get these wheels moving
we got to get these wheels moving we we we got too many of us
into into really great places we got to keep it moving so
next week is going to be the best week ever
we're going to have a chance to thank all the folks that have made this happen
to reveal some really big stuff uh open it up way bigger than we've ever
done it before have a sponsored class by microsoft next week we learn git and
github and microsoft is sponsoring github is sponsoring we got swag we got

00:36
laptops we got amazing stuff so today was the best news ever uh to set a goal
and to knock that goal out the park through the stratosphere to be way past
100 jobs we're past 100 like like i don't know if you've been paying
attention to that celebrations channel but uh
it's been kind of blowing up recently like every day there's somebody new in
there and so we're way past a hundred uh i could i i
really honestly me and blah talk about this a little bit every once in a while
i really thought it'd be me and 10 people max and i would help those 10
people and that would be it so i can't in my wildest dreams ever
imagine that we have uh 3 000 plus people here all trying to learn how to code
maybe change their lives maybe get that job that they've always

00:37
wanted have that security for themselves and their loved ones to have a career
that's high growth that they know is setting them up for life if you're here
and you're ready to put in the work i got you
it's no longer a hundred we're going for something bigger and so at this moment
we're setting up the best week ever and on the first day of the best week
ever i think we got some big changes to make i think we i think we need a new
goal and so come back next week for the best week ever
because we got some bigger goals to hit we got some bigger things we gotta do we
got two bet we got too good of a community
we got too good of a community to stop at a hundred
this is the best place to learn how to code live online we online folks we're
learning how to code and if you're here i know that you can do it too i know

00:38
that you can join these hundreds you have the ability you have the aptitude
you have the will you have now the way that a hundred other people have
followed you can do this too give yourself a little bit of grace give
yourself a little bit of trust give me a little bit of trust in return i think i
earned a little bit of trust i think after you get 100 people through that
through that gate yeah i think i got a little bit of trust so give me a little
bit of trust and we'll get you there too alrighty folks thank you for
enabling me to hit a goal that i set that i really wanted to accomplish
this really is one of the best things that i've ever been able to accomplish
in my life it's something that i am super proud of and it's just
getting started next week best week ever alrighty
let's get into our review i i know i feel like we're on top of the world and
i'm just like all right javascript now that was like javascript uh we had a
lot of folks that did some stuff but i was in i was in ranty mode

00:39
um also make sure i go through these uh we had some sound alerts we had a
hydration lip dab thank you for the hydration cheers to you
and a lot of sound alerts dab was in here ay all right folks thank you so much
oh yeah hey thank you for the five kids and subs appreciate you thanks for being
here oh people are saying what about the funnest portfolios the funnest projects
well since we're revealing the merch next
week we'll reveal who wins because they get that merch so we'll
we'll wrap that into the best week ever uh so that folks that know who they're
winning who won actually know what they're getting yeah cool

00:40
all right let's get into our review let's get into our practice here
programming remember i feel so feel so wild to just jump right into this
a computer will do what you tell it to do
all right computer will do what we tell it to do what is the program
i'm sorry i'm still a big lead computer will do what we tell it to do
there's a program while program is a set of instructions that we write to tell
the computer what to do what is programming programming is the task of
writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand we use
javascript to write those instructions because it's a little bit more human
readable it's something that we can understand and share that can then be
broken down into something that the computer can understand
javascript has a specific syntax that we've been learning
all these little extra bits and bobs that make up the spelling and grammar
rules of the language parentheses there curly braces there
javascript has a specific syntax that we have to learn and pick up

00:41
we learned about the big four right i'm too hyped to focus i feel
the same way i'm like uh we learned about the big four we
learned about variables variables our way of storing a value to be used later
on we literally store it into the memory of the computer so we can use those
values later on we can declare a variable and assign it at the same time
that's what we're seeing here a declaration and an assignment
we also learned about conditionals where conditionals are where we check to
see if something is true and if it's if it is true we do it's in those curly
braces and then we stop that's it but if it's not true we move on to our else if
the check if that's true if it is we do is inside those curly braces and then we
stop but if the if is not true and any of our else because we can have multiple
or not true our else can auto magically run
and if that else auto magically runs it doesn't check anything

00:42
it just does what's inside the curly braces we talked about danger of assignment
versus comparison this idea that when we're inside of our conditionals if we
just do one equal sign that's assigning a variable it's not comparing anything
we'll run into some issues all right we learned about multiple conditions
where we can have this double ampersand where both of these conditions must be
true and today is the day where i feel it the most folks today's the day where
i feel it the most where my name is leon and in this moment
my status truly is ballin that's all i'm gonna say hey
you get a wink there you go can't say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to me today that's all i
gotta say we also have ore right we also have ore
where as long as it is saturday or sunday just one of these conditions is true

00:43
uh then we can say it's the weekend we learned about functions chat what are
functions what do they enable us to do what do they enable us to do
yeah they're just sets of instructions there are building blocks it's how we
build up our programs it's just sets of instructions
and they're reusable uh the cool thing is that we're starting to see these
functions kind of seep in everywhere at first we just had regular function
declarations right where we had a function and then a regular call but now we're
also seeing like anonymous functions where they're kind of thrown in where
functions are taking in functions right we have this idea of like higher order
functions and these other things that are coming in we're passing in arrow
functions so they become a really essential piece of how we write our
javascript and it's really important that we understand how to use them so
we're going to see a lot of functions today again we're going to see a lot of

00:44
functions being used with our methods when it comes to arrays and objects but
they really are the fundamental building blocks of our program they're meant to
be reusable so that we can repeat actions without having to retype the
code over and over again so here we have a function call
we're passing in hello as an argument it falls into our parameter of word
wherever we see word it's actually hello you could think of functions with
parameters as mad libs exactly dab that's a really good analogy
you're just filling in the blanks beautiful
loops what are loops dab when are you streaming again come on we need you back
we need you now more than ever i'll wait can we get a stream dab

00:45
you just got you just got your new computer so soon hell yeah let's go
uh dad's part of our stream team uh these hundred i didn't think the stream
team the stream team willed folks across
that finish line there are folks on this list
uh of the hundred that are only there because of what dab did
uh what what what occ did and and creating a space where they can
continue to learn where they could ask questions so there are folks on this list
that pulled up pulled individuals through whether through code or support
they're on that list because of them so big shout out to our stream team
dab we need you back occ we need you back too i see you in chat let's go
like i said i i wanted to put out the general thank you but next week best
week ever i'm i'm putting it every i'm calling you out your name's gonna be in
the slides if you don't if you don't want me to put
your business out there let me know because we got too many big folks to to

00:46
thank dave hey thank you for the good this subs thank you for being here thank
you for all you do all right loops what are loops we already saw some
folks in chat we have the ability to repeat an action multiple times right we
have the ability to repeat an action multiple times we saw a couple loops so
far we saw four while and we got to a raise we saw a couple other
big loops as well we saw things like for each map we're going to see some other
ones today too that enable us to loop through content and do some stuff with it
we have our traditional for loop where we set up our increment we say how far
until the loop stops we go up by one each iteration and so in this case we'd
be just printing our numbers to the console until we hit our end condition
beautiful we also have a while loop which is
another similar loop where we start off our count

00:47
and then inside of our count we go up by one each time so a little bit different
where we don't have in our for loop all the stuff set up right away we have uh
the increment that we're keeping track of we're incrementing it inside of the
loop and we still have our condition that's being checked each time cool
i don't get the difference between i equals zero and i equals one when do we
use one versus the other all that is is when you want to
all that is is when you want to start right
all it is is when you want to where you want to start do you want to start
counting at zero or you want to start counting at one the reason why you will
see a lot of folks start off with zero especially if you're working with a
raise right if you're if you're gonna loop through values in an array
it's always probably a really good idea to start with zero because the index of
that array starts at zero right so if you started at one you would

00:48
always skip the first value in the array
cool so in that case if you're if you're looping through things in an array you
have to start at zero or else you're gonna be missing things if you're just
trying to use the increment as a counter you don't need to count zero you can
just start at one so like if you're trying to say like one two three four
you could start at one but if you're working with a raise you're probably
going to start at zero and a lot of engineers kind of just start with zero
out of habit even if they were just going to count they would still start
with zero alrighty today we have all of our review code is power
ranger themed uh we're gonna get some morphin time going on uh for those that
don't know the best tv shows ever made are the bachelor followed up by the
power rangers we of course have today highlight it for us the mike morphin
power rangers and we'll move into the alien rangers then we'll hit some zeo

00:49
maybe a little bit of turbo you know if we're feeling really really good
we'll maybe do a little bit of space a little bit of lost galaxy a little bit
of light speed you know but we'll slow down though we'll slow
down once we get the time for space force you know all that fun stuff
but uh for tonight we're going to start with our mighty morphin review
let's go ahead and open that up oh no did i not have it open already one second
there we go i'm gonna open it up we have the mighty morphin review
let's go ahead and open up this mighty morphin review
we have the javascript file there's review for variables functions

00:50
conditionals and loops we're going to put where are we at time-wise
let's put seven minutes on the clock here seven minutes on the clock see how far
you can get in these seven minutes and then we will stop we'll take our
break and then we'll come back from the break to review so seven minutes on the
clock you got this dig deep and then we'll review uh after our break
so some minutes dig in you got this mighty morphin review
blossom we're about to see some flexosauruses yeah they can't help themselves
not the jurassic but they they they gotta go hard update your vs code
no i haven't read the release yet the release nets yet

00:51
i haven't read the release notes yet i don't update definitely not midstream
let's just just click that little xy poo there live dangerously
where can i find the stream team folks yes we have a special channel so whenever
um folks go live on the stream team you can see their notification and go live
uh there's a stream team channel on discord make sure you turn that
notification on as we have folks streaming on the stream
team again we have a lot of new folks that are kind of in the process of
joining the stream team um we have two that are ready to go and so as part of
the best week ever we'll we'll have their their joining of the team will

00:52
make it a big deal can we have another tourist space with
folks that got jobs yeah our goal starting next week with the best week
ever is to do a space every week so we're going to be mainly doing
discord spaces because it's a little bit it's a little bit better and it's just
us we don't worry about um the riff raft
coming in oh yeah so we'll be doing some twitter spaces but a lot of discord
spaces as well and we're going to try and do that once a week
i don't understand what the stream team is it's just a group of folks that

00:53
stream learning to code or coding that are part of the 100 devs family
what's the drink i got some vanilla chai tea and some ice water
seltzer tonight that's the move i like seltzer but it makes me um
do some sounds i don't think you all need to hear yeah
i like that too blah said no code weenies no gatekeepers nobody trying to

00:54
sell you anything exactly ain't trying to beyblade it up on stream
lee no definitely start um it you gotta you gotta do it for a while and then
once you've been doing it for a while we look at your vods and
make the call to add you or not there that's awesome here thank you for
joining us can i buy a sub with my leon dollars you
can get all the stuff like you can um you can get all the emotes and stuff by
using your channel points uh jm the stream team is on twitch
what that that's amazing you got promoted to mid level right now
you're working on first solo large site-wide feature that's amazing

00:55
congrats that's huge well deserved do you get more channel points if you
sub unfortunately yeah unfortunately when you sub that like increases the
rate um yeah i mean it's a perk but i don't want
folks to ever feel like they have to sub jw 330 hey thank you for the hydration

00:56
cheers to you uh candacer is there some study to make
the commands work no sometimes just multiple people have used the commands
and so it's not like it tries to stop people from spamming them basically
uh j john this is stream beats by harris heller
kabaddi all of our subs and donations and stuff like that go to uh resilient
coders which is the nonprofit i work at during the day

00:57
which we'll probably announce in best week ever because we need to make our
next like big big payment can you promo megazord with javascript that'd be a fun
fun project alrighty folks come on back come on back alrighty so
let's take a look at the first one together and then we'll take our break
we'll take our first one together and then we'll and then we'll take a look at
the break we'll take a look at the first one
together and then we'll take our break the clear variable reassign it to your

00:58
favorite holiday make sure it's in all caps and print the value to the console
if you want all the cap what do we have to do
you want it in all caps what could we what can we do to make it all cap
ah two uppercase two uppercase so let's go ahead and
create a favorite holiday uh so let favorite holiday
equal and we're going to say halloween beautiful
and then i want to reassign it to be in awe cap so i'm going to say
fave holiday equals fave and i could have done this all in one line i'm just
gonna do it for readability to uppercase beautiful to uppercase and then print
the value to the console so console.log and we'll print favorite holiday let's
save this let's make sure that it is working open in default browser
oh look at that that's good well i got this is tradition

00:59
i have to do all the poses and then we'll see if it worked
all right let's go ahead and do it all right i'll put the microphone over here
all right we'll do black first yellow i'm gonna go ahead and do green next red
and do pink before before before there was charlene
there was the pink ranger and then blue there we go nice now we can see if it
worked all right first try halloween is uh is all capitalized all right
all capitalized and it looks like it's working and so
what we can do now is we can rest assured that we can take our break so
five minutes on the clock if you're new around here we like to be healthy we
liked at the top of every hour so make sure we're letting our fingers and our

01:00
eyes get a little bit of a break so if you're able please get up move around
hydrate and then be back in five minutes we're gonna go through the rest of this
together and we're gonna move on we got a lot of fun stuff to get to tonight
really excited to get through a little bit more review and then get into our
objects uh once we get the objects the things things start to everything starts
to kind of click a little bit start to learn some of the mysteries that is
javascript so if you're interested in learning the mysteries of what is

01:01

01:02

01:03

01:04
javascript i'll see you in five minutes so you um [Music]

01:05
i think i forgot to run ads whoopsie [Music] yeah i think they ran
uh die we always open up the links to submit the clips after class so it'll be
open after class super behind on the reading that's okay noro um
it's a lot the reading this week was particularly a lot so you'll notice that
we've given a little bit more time for some of the reading lina lux hey
thank you for the raid hope you're doing well
thank you for being here thanks for bringing the crew along
what were you working on what are you up to this evening how did the um
bug fixing today nice how did the uh the vote go the i know
you were up for the the award how did that shake out has that happened yet

01:06
welcome raiders hope you're doing well for those that are new we're doing a 30
week software engineering bootcamp night reviewing some arrays and going
into objects in javascript it's announced friday alright let's go turn up
fingers crossed all right folks come on back let's get in here
you're not following lena lecture you're you're out of your mind at this point
i'm going gonna throw a shout out in chat boom all right
i'm gonna copy this myself definitely give them a follow you
haven't followed yet um alrighty welcome back let's chill the

01:07
music here we got some review to get through so uh before the raid we had uh
started working through this review and so we had seven minutes
to do review then we took our break so now we're going to finish going through
the problems together all right the clara variable assign it a string
and then alert the last three characters in the string
so this is one of those ones where you probably had to do some some some
research try to do some research on this one uh
so let's go and take a look at let's go and do the first thing let's let's
declare our variable so let's go ahead and do let um fave power rangers equal
and then i am going to go with oh cool yeah i'm saying it i'm going to say it

01:08
i'm going to say how that i'm going to say it not not the favorite
ranger the favorite ranger is too that's that's not something we can come to
terms with tonight like do you go black ranger do you go green reader does the
white ranger separate from the green ranger and what version of power rangers
are you talking about when you mention the green ranger because it changes
we can't get there tonight so i'm going to say my favorite favorite power
rangers series series there we go beautiful favorite power rangers series
because we can't get into that tonight ninja storm's up there i see some folks
throwing that out there i'm going to go to alien ranger that's where that's
where the game got changed the the the the costuming the k like the movies ah
that's when it hit a stride folks all right so i want to
alert the last three characters of this string so alert what could i do

01:09
who came up with a way to grab just the last three characters
oh i see some folks with the slicing i like that let's let's try that slice
so we're going to do fave power ranger series we're going to do slice
and we're going to do negative 3 because we want the
last three characters so this is one of those methods right we haven't it was in
some of the reading a little bit but if you didn't see it in there we you had
the research you had to figure out all right what could i use to get the last
three characters it's something you had to google you had to dig deep find a
method so let's see if this slice 3 negative 3 works and then we'll talk
about why it works if it does let's go back let's refresh
all right erz did that work errs let's see
hers is the last three letters of alien rangers beautiful that did work
uh so we have this slice and slice is a method that could take in

01:10
a bunch of numbers and what we notice if we pass in a negative number it takes
the last three so it's a beautiful way to just grab pieces of the string are
there a bunch of other methods that you could use yes there's substring there's
char we could treat the string as an array there's all these other things we
could do and one of the things and one of the
reasons why i asked you to do your code wars right no jones the reason i
actually do your code wars is because you learn all these little tricks and
these gotchas and these methods you get to use them in a particular place so
that's a cool one all right first story functions
create a function that takes in five numbers subtract all five numbers from a
hundred alert the absolute value of the difference called the function all right
so let's go ahead and create our function we're going to call uh minus five and
abs for absolute i mean we're taking in five numbers our parameters could be

01:11
whatever we call we could call them rainbow unicorn monster fire truck
ping pong it doesn't matter um but we're just gonna know that they're numbers so
we'll do n1 and two and three and four and n5 beautiful
and then we have to subtract them all from 100 100 so let's do let's set up
our variable here let difference equal 100 minus n1 minus n2
minus n3 minus and four minus and five there we go so that's the difference
and then alert the absolute value of the difference so let's go ahead and do our
alert and how the heck can we get the absolute value oh thank you chat
we got the math.absolute and that's one of those
things like if you didn't know how to do it you would have to go to the googles

01:12
right uh absolute value in java script i might even throw an mdn on
there just to to to get there because we see the mdn
has a math.absolute beautiful always go straight to the mdn
all right there's an absolute function that returns the absolute value so even
if i didn't know what absolute value was right
even if i didn't know what that was i could see that oh it's built in with
this math object that we'll get to in the mdm we trust exactly now i can go
back i can trust that math.absolute is the right thing and i'll pass in
difference all right let's call the function as it asks and we'll try it out
had to use that on my code wars today that's dope that's awesome cool
let's go ahead and do -5 and alert minus five and absolute and

01:13
we're going to pass in some numbers let's pass in um 27 83 42 1 and 5. beautiful
let's go ahead and run this and see what we get
man these poses just get you going it's gonna be like no i'm talking about
anyway everybody ever gives you a problem just hit that post ah boom
gets you going all right let's refresh ers 58.
all right so it works so we got we got the absolute value of 58. and we know
that the absolute value is working because this would have subtracting from 100
we would have been way below zero and so the absolute value [Music]
the absolute value is working here because we're getting we're not getting
a negative number it's giving us the absolute value um people are saying uh

01:14
interview pose could you just imagine you're in your first technical interview
and the whole time you're just like this just like you just hold in the pose
you're beast in the interview by the way right you're beast in the interview
right but after like each question you're just like ah right they give you
a behavioral question you're like you're they they give you a technical
question you're like oh all right but you're still you're crushing it right
i think you i think you still get the job
i think if you're busting out the power ranger poses and you're crushing it
that's all that's all the better you heard that here that's my that's my advice
in technical interviews please bust out your power ranger moves guaranteed to
get the job we don't get got dark shinobi a thank
you for the hydration cheers to you instant 20k hiring points exactly all

01:15
right first try going to the next one here create a function that takes in three
numbers console log the lowest and highest values interesting all right function
log high and low and we're going to take in three numbers
so we'll take in we'll just use the same kind of thing n1 and two and three
and console log the lowest and the highest values and so for me the lowest and
highest values there's a couple ways i can get them
anybody know what that what they did oh i'm seeing some folks throwing out
min and max there is a math.min and a math.max that is true um
let's go ahead and do that let's go ahead and say let min equal math.min
and we will throw in n1 n2 and n3 and what that should do

01:16
is based on these values that we passed in
it should give us the minimum value and place it in the variable min
we could have also sorted it that would have been a different way to go about it
like sorting it and then taking um the first and last that's that's totally a
way that you could have done this as well but let's see some of these methods
right we'll see sorting later today we'll see some we'll see some sorting um
ones uh later on so we'll come back to the store in a little bit
all right so we got math.min let's get max math.max
let's pass it in one and two and three beautiful so now we have the min and the
max pin and the max now we have the min and the max what we need to do
is like use them let's go ahead and what does it say

01:17
wants us to do a console log let's go ahead and do our log
and we will let's use a let's lose a template literal when i use a template
literal what am i starting my string off with like how am i setting up my string
could you have done this without declaring variables absolutely but i
like the readability of having the variables
i got to use the back ticks here so i'm going to say the the lowest num
is and then i can use my bling syntax where i can then go ahead and just put
min in here is blank and the highest num is and i'll use my syntax again and
i'll throw in max so the idea here is since i've used my back ticks i can
plug variables in using this bling syntax where i do
dollar sign and then the curly braces cool let's see if this works let's call it

01:18
so we'll call log high and low and we're going to pass in some values
let's pass in 100 50 and 25. so if this works we should see 25 and
100 in the console yeah way better than concatenating exactly juice let's go
ahead and save this let's see if it works and let's see where we're at
all right we got the ers we got the 58 and then we see the lowest num is 25 and
the highest numb is a hundred so it looks like it's working
right looks like it's working alrighty and we can take a peek at this right
first try we can take a peek at this where what we did is we passed in all three
numbers right as our parameters and we passed our parameters into this min
into this min and that just grabs the lowest number out of the three that we

01:19
had passed in same thing for max it's gonna grab the highest number out of
three that we pass in and then i'm just going to use my template literal here my
template string here and i can pass my variables in without having to do any of
that nasty nasty concatenation my bling syntax didn't work make sure
you use the ticks and not quotes you don't use the back ticks it won't
work uh the back ticks are on your um on your on your um
tilde key so here's a normal keyboard and then like right above the tab
is the tilde key that's what you're going to hit
i can't show you on my actual keyboard my actual keyboard is in a very
different spot right there but on a normal keyboard that's where it is
above the tab yeah and then like different countries

01:20
it's gonna be a different spot cool i just showed you how dusty my keyboards
are it's kind of embarrassing but it doesn't matter because first try
all right next one all right create a function
create a function that returns heads or tails randomly as fairly as possible and
call the function as soon as you know we're going to be doing something
randomly what are we probably going to be using ryan it is yeah
yeah math.random so we're seeing this math object comes with a lot of goodies
and we're going to use this random one as well so let's go ahead and create a
function since we're getting heads or heads or tails we're going to call this
heads or tails and let's just go ahead and set up the the

01:21
result of like the flip so we can do like let result
equal and then we'll do math dot random so what math.random is going to do
is it's going to return a value between zero and one
right math.random is gonna return a value between zero and one so
if we wanted to make it a 50 50 result if we wanted to be a 50 50 result a
heads or tails we could set up a conditional
right we could do a conditional that checks for one half or the other half
so what i'm thinking i'm going to set up a conditional and do an if
and i'm going to say if result is less than what

01:22
less than 0.5 exactly if result is less than 0.5 um we can
i was supposed to return so we'll return heads
i guess we have to return like a string of heads right we'll turn a string of
heads and then if it's not less than 0.5 the only other thing it can be
would be what the only other thing it could be would be tails
all right so the idea here the idea here is that math.random
will return a number between 1 and 0. so half the time it'll be less than 0.5
and the other half it'll be 0.5 or greater
right so one half it'll be less than 0.5 the other half will be 0.5 or greater
right now the the the reason why people are saying like do we need the equals is
it's very specific it goes from zero to one but it's not inclusive of one
right so it's not inclusive of one uh so

01:23
since it's not inclusive of one we don't have to do the less than or equal to
it's between zero and one but doesn't include one yeah
so that's why we can just do less than point five cool i think this should work
looks good to me let's go ahead and call it
select let's um let's throw it in the console log because it's a return right
since this is a return if we just called it it would poof in the thin air i see
the stretch i got you let's see if this works and then i got you on nemog
all right let's go ahead and do this heads or tails
we're going to call it and we're going to call it inside the console log
let's go back let's refresh we got some others that
have to run first boom boom and we got tails nice let's refresh the page
boom we got heads all right so we know we're getting heads and tails that

01:24
worked beautifully couldn't have planned it better myself all right cool
let's go ahead and do this last one first tree uh and we have a stretch
nemog 777 thank you for the stretch i'm gonna do a real stretch and you know if
you really want to see me stretching there's only one way you can get that
type of content so that's the type of content you're missing folks
only a million channel points come on what's a million channel points only a
million channel points and you get that lovely lovely content all right

01:25
somebody said how could we test this know if it really works
well eventually we're going to get into testing our javascript we're going to
write test cases so if you've been doing your
code wars you'll notice that codewars enables you to write test cases right
and so we could write test cases to see if this works or not and we could run a
bunch of them so eventually we'll get to testing later on in program towards the
end but that's one way we can test to make
sure that stuff really does work to make sure it is like functioning heads or
tails yeah all righty last one here create a function that takes in a number
console log the result of heads or tails using the previous function x times
where x is the number passed into the function called the function
all right hold on let me read this again
create a function that takes in a number
i know i write these but still sometimes i forget what i write create a function

01:26
that takes in a number console log the result of heads or tails
so we're just gonna we're just gonna run the heads or tails function again
um x times where x is the number passed into the function so all we're going to
do is we're just going to we're just going to run the heads or tails multiple
times uh and just result and console.log the
result so i'm just going to console i'm just gonna comment that out so we don't
actually have that running up here and let's go and set this up function
we're gonna call this uh i think last time i called it uh what
did they call it last uh yeah flip flip flip flip flip adelphia
there we go so we're going to call this flip flip flipadelphia
and uh this is going to be our function to flip a certain number of times uh so
it said x times we're just going to put in here the the the number of times
right so i'm just going to use n which is short for the number of times that we

01:27
want this to run and then we can set up a really simple for loop so four
let i equal one i'll start counting at one uh while i is less than and we'll say
including that number one of the mistakes we've made in the past is where
we forgot to include the equals because we're going to go from one including
that number so we'll say n and then we'll do i plus plus okay
and then we're going to have result result equal and we're just going to
call this function heads or tails cool so what we're going to do is we're
going to call this heads or tails function each time the loop runs and the cool
thing is that this heads or tails function is already set up to return
heads and already set up to return tails so i actually don't need to do anything

01:28
special other than um console logging the result all right so this should work
let's um let's test it out it's actually kind of hard to see this
all in one line so i think i'm actually going to do this function in one line
i think we'll come back and do this one line because i'm kind of having a hard
time getting them both on the page let's see if this works
um let's go ahead and call it flip flip adelphia
and we're going to do this 10 times we should see 10 results we should we
should see 10 like mixing of heads and tails
all right let's go back let's refresh there's 58
all right so we got two heads two tails and then
five more heads and a tail so this did run 10 times
uh and it was it was definitely definitely felt heads more than tails

01:29
and so what we can do let's make sure this runs one time
let's make sure this runs one time let's see and let's refresh boom boom
boom all right so it does run one time so what we can do is we can yolo some
channel points right now folks this is this is what we did we just we just
built ourselves a gambling machine uh so
let's yolo some channel points some some of you want to get that sweet sweet
sweet of content but you need more points so tonight's the night
thanks tonight folks let's go ahead um start a prediction uh we're gonna say
heads or tails and the first outcome will be heads
and the second outcome would be tails you have a minute to get in here and i'm
starting it now all right so you can you can join the

01:30
prediction heads or tails you can risk as many channel points as you want and
then we're gonna run we're gonna refresh
the page and whenever it says that's who wins
all right let's see how many people how many channel points people are throwing
up on this you only got a minute to get in here folks oh
280 000 channel points on heads right now
oh 400 to 6 300 oh first we might hit it we might hit a thousand
we only hit a million channel points oh yeah we're we're
we're way over a million channel points up for risk here folks
way over a million oh no what did i what did i unlock in all of you oh no

01:31
1.3 million to 1.2 million [Laughter] all in baby let's go all right
let's do it for all the channel points let's see what we get all right let's
refresh the page all right we got our ers we got our 58 you ready has it
tails got it let's see let me let me confirm the prediction choose outcome
51 of you said tails so 1.5 million up against 1.4 million
uh let's choose outcome it was tails we're going to complete the prediction
all right so you should have gotten your channel points there
the prediction result was tails oh boy we don't
hold on let's see the details of this one it was 50 50 in the end

01:32
i think the most channel points risked was 49 000 channel points by honda civic
so honda civic risked 49k and what the come up
is dangerously close to being over 100k wow wow congrats honda that was wild
oh no we got we got some big ones coming in hold on let's see
people ready to splash out with their channel points now
uh mx with the hydration cheers to you uh pokemon card
and durie i'll get those at the end and then
um diego splashed out with guide the raid uh so diego send me a whisper

01:33
with the person you want us to raid in the software and game dev category has
to be in the game software and game dev category
uh semi-a whisper and uh that's who we'll raid
cool has to be in the software and game dev category we don't rate anybody else
double or nothing i don't want to i don't want to unlock that and and some
individuals we'll run it back maybe later maybe after our next break
i want to take a look at this though before before we move on before we move on
uh let's go ahead and let's go ahead and take let's take a look
at this right here how could i do how could i do this maybe like all
on like one line like i i like this function but we
learned some things in the past we saw some arrow functions and we know
how to do ternaries exactly so let's let's see if we can combine our arrow

01:34
functions and turn it i'm going to comment this out i'm going to say const
heads or tails and i'm going to set it equal to are we taking in anything
so we can go ahead and then do let's go ahead and do um what's our math dot
random right math.random less than 0.5 right less than 0.5
and we're going to say if it is less than 0.5 we return heads
and if it's greater than 0.5 we return tails
let's see let's see if this works let's see if this works

01:35
let's see if we still get a result let's come back let's refresh
boom boom all right still working we got the tails
all right so let's talk about this so for me this is all in one line which is
beautiful we got not tails again it's rigged so that's the thing this is
the beauty this this is this is high stakes
this is this would be like i feel like we need to do this
i feel like we need to do a day where we just risk channel points
this won't work out in my favor because we'll hit the only fans where we risk
channel points but the code could be right or wrong so not only are you like
you're trying to like like risk your points
but like the code might be wrong and it might favor
someone else dab i think we need to do this dab i think me and you need to do
like a like a game show where we write out code and we're either
like with chat or against chat we're like we're throwing in bugs or not

01:36
throwing in bugs and we risk our channel points i think that'd be really fun
let's keep that let's see if we can make that happen all right
so what's going on here is we set up an arrow function
and there's two key things about the arrow function
a lot of folks are saying what about parentheses
well you only really need parentheses if you know you're going to have
multiple parameters so you really need the parentheses when you're doing
multiple parameters like x and i or something like that right
right x and i right that that's that's what what we could do there right
we could do x or i right um we could do just empty parentheses that's pretty
common right that's pretty common right that's pretty common
um but it was all a bamboozle because you can also do like i just do this
underscore right i do this underscore just to say like hey i'm not passing in

01:37
anything right i'm just passing i'm just passing in
anything right like i'm not passing in anything so i put the underscore for me
when i don't pass in anything i just do an underscore and that's for me
and for the other developers i work with to know like hey like i'm not i'm not
passing anything in it's just empty so you can put any character there you want
it but i just do the underscore to say like hey i'm not passing in anything and
this is a preference that you'll see come up again as we get further into
javascript uh and then just the the arrow and then there's something wrong with
this code this code ran it it gave us a result but there's something wrong
while y'all were working on the parentheses over here the real
parentheses we were missing we're here there we go so now it'll actually do
random because random's a method and i forgot it right so second try um

01:38
so here now if we want this random method to run we actually need the
parentheses right it won't run without the parentheses and so since this always
fails right since it always fails we would always get tails but now that we
have the parentheses this should work and now we should get heads or tails
good on y'all that noticed that that was a good catch
beautiful all right and it still works let's run it a few times just to make
sure we're good heads great so now we see that it's
working beautiful ah yes occ also brought up the implicit return
uh this is an implicit return we don't need the return keyword
like we don't need the like we have the return keyword
we have the return keyword up here we don't need it with an arrow function
because there's something called an implicit return it just does the return
for you right it just does the no bright side that's why

01:39
uh it just does the return for you so what winds up happening
is we're gonna call this heads or tails function
we check to see if it's less than 0.5 like the math.random gives us the number
between 0 and 1. if it's less than 0.5 we implicitly return heads
if it's anything other than less than 0.5 we implicitly return tails so that
means down here we're just returning heads or tails whenever we call it
beautiful flip flip flip adelphia yeah there's nothing here telling it the
console log it's down here where we're doing the console logging yeah
because we we call this function here and what winds up happening is we wind
up running this function each time the loop runs and the heads or tails gets
returned to where the function is called so we get heads returned here we get

01:40
tails returned here over and over again cool alrighty
it's one of those ones to come back with play around with it get into the muck
with it you'll kind of see these tern areas pop up here and there but if
you're like if you're looking i want to get better at this stuff here there's
one thing you can do that will help you get better at like understanding and
writing this kind of code i i didn't know how to write this code
until i started doing something very specific yeah that's code wars exactly
um i i saw this pattern i first saw this pattern probably on code wars right
i probably saw this on code wars i incorporated this is definitely my anki
like this whole line is in my inky i incorporate it into my anki

01:41
and now i can recall it with pretty good precision pretty quickly yeah
um can i explain it in a pseudo code kind of way well it's just that we have
a function we have a math.random where it returns a
zero between zero and one and so if whatever value comes here is less than
0.5 that winds up being a true statement and whenever you have a true statement
on the left-hand side of a ternary you automatically
grab the heads it's the sorry you grab the the left-hand side so you would grab
heads in this case if for whatever reason this evaluates to false you would
grab what's on the right hand side of the colon it's the same thing as the
conditional here don't let it don't let the ternary scare you this is the exact
same thing as having an if and an else this is the if the if is true and this
is the else if it wasn't that's all what's an anki anki is our space

01:42
repetition tool that we use it's kind of like flash cards with an algorithm
behind it if this is your first class with us our
very first class on youtube you can do exclamation point youtube covers anki
and why you'd want to use it cool all right let's move on folks cool
we talked about arrays we talked about arrays a lot this last two classes
chat what are arrays i still don't get the underscore it's
just a it's just a it's just a parameter
instead of doing like x or i because i'm
not going to use it i just do underscore and that just lets me know hey this is
like empty i'm not going to use this at all we could have put an x there we
could have put an i there it could have been any other we could just put empty
parentheses but since i don't actually need a parameter there i do the
underscore yeah raise are toasters exactly and when

01:43
we say a toaster what we really mean is an element
that can store other elements right a data structure that can hold other things
and so we like to think of bill gates toaster where it can hold a bunch of
stuff and every single time it needs to add something new it gets a new slot and
a new slot and a new slot some tricky things with arrays is that
they start they're counting or index with what zero exactly
there are two different ways to create a
raise there's this constructor way which we'll actually start using probably on
thursday or tuesday because we'll understand how to use constructors when
it comes to objects but the way we've been using it so far is using literal
notation using square brackets where we literally create an array
when we create an array we can put elements inside of the array

01:44
and we also have the ability to pull stuff out or put stuff into an array
using its index 0 1 2 or 3. if you're new this is all stuff that
we're doing a review that's why we're going through it kind of quickly we have
two or three classes that you can find here on twitch and then on youtube that
go through this in detail alrighty so here uh here's us grabbing
stuff out of the array using its index new array zero gives us zebra
new array one gives us undefined y agent hanzo hey thank you for the
hydration cheers to you it's empty exactly there's nothing in
this space right there's nothing in this space so we get undefined
and then we grab the the element and the second index so 0
1 2 so we get true and then here's us grabbing the element in the third index 0

01:45
1 2 3 we get 21 21 21 21 beautiful we can also put stuff into an array
using the index so here i'm grabbing that undefined space and plopping the
string of bob into it the spaces don't have to be empty for us to put stuff in
we could just have easily changed this to zero and overhead zebra to be bob
uh the tricky thing is that we can actually overwrite whole arrays with
arrays and so you can overwrite a whole array by assigning an array to a
different array so here we have two arrays cars and nums we set cars equal
to nums and we ask for cars we get one two three
we can also get the a length off of an array and let and keep that in your keep
that in the back of your brain we can get the length of an array because it's
gonna we're gonna get the objects later today and we're gonna have to come back
to this so we can get the length of an array and it'll tell us how many
elements are in that array and the tricky thing is that it counts starting

01:46
at one so the indexes start at zero but the length starts at one all right
we can also iterate through arrays where we're trying to pull each value out of
an array uh we saw a simple way of using a for loop right with a for loop we can
just kind of grab a number and count from zero to some number and we can use
that number to pull values out of the array so i start my increment of i at zero
and that's because the very first time i want this to run right the very first
time i want this to run oh that's such a good question
muhammad asked a super good question why does length not have
parentheses at the end hold hold on just hold that's that's
such a beautiful question we're going to get there today i will answer that
question by the end of today what a good question
all right we start our account at zero blowing it up but yes

01:47
we're starting to count at zero so we can use the index best colors zero would
give us green then one would give us blue two would give us yellow three
would give us black we can also use methods that are built
in with arrays to help us right to help us loop through our content so
for each is a goblin that runs and each time it runs it grabs the
element its index and the actual array that it comes from and passes it in to
this function what kind of function is this what do we call this is what kind of
function is this yeah it's an arrow function um
some in previous time we would have used anonymous functions just functions
without a name because we're passing a function into a function we don't need
all that declaration syntax or any of that stuff we don't need the function

01:48
keyword because we're passing it in as a what we're passing it in as a what
as an argument exactly we're passing it as an argument beautiful all right
we also saw some wonderful methods that came with a raise other than for each we
saw shift pop unshift you saw all these wonderful
methods let's run through them again so here we have an array
best wrappers 2020 on that list we have six nine polo g and six nine
pretty quickly we shift off six nine it's what it does is it takes
the beginning of the array and pulls it off
if you were to just do shift you could grab that first value off and it would
poof evaporate into the ether but we've actually stored it in a variable called
removed and so right now six nine is pulled off

01:49
and it's stored in the variable removed however if we ask for best rappers 2020
we can see that the array has changed and no longer has that first six nine
it's just polo g and six nine on the right hand side
right so we shift shift takes the first thing off of an array and pulls it off
next we learned how to pop so when we pop we take the value that's at the end
of the array and we take that off so shift is off the front
pop is off the end and so when we ask for best rappers 2020 we wind up with is
just polo g at the moment right just polo g at the moment because we've
we've already shifted six nine off we've shifted the other six nine off sorry
we've popped the other six nine off and we just have polo g left

01:50
pop lock and drop it a yeah you don't know about that huh
i don't know about that huh all right i see you you don't know huh
learn something new today all right so we're left with just polo g because
we we shifted off and we popped off beautiful
now we can actually do the almost kind of opposite right we can unshift which
is putting something on the front so here i had just polo g
and i unshifted dylon so now dailon is on the front of best wrappers 2020
and we can do the same on the other side we can push
dailon onto the back of the array so now when we look
we have dailon dylon pologian dylon rk mace hey thank you for the gift of

01:51
subs thank you for being here beautiful so now we have in the best wrappers 2020
we have dailon pology and dailon because we we shifted off and popped off six
nine and then we we unshifted and pushed dylon beautiful
now the last method that we saw was map and map is going to run once for each
element in the array but map does one very specific thing
what what does map do what makes map different like what does it
do we have more viewers than timberland timberland stream and that's wild
without the timberland it returns a brand new array
exactly returns a brand new array wonderful so if we are going to run once
for each element in the array does map do anything what is what's the

01:52
only thing that map returns this is this is an implicit
this is ray timberland this is an implicit return right so the only thing
this map is doing is returning what the only thing this does is it returns
dylon so if we know that this map is going to run three times what we're
really doing is creating a new array for best rappers of all time
that has dailon in it that's the first time it runs then it's going to grab
polo g but it doesn't do anything with it it just returns dylon
and then it's going to run a third time it doesn't even matter that it was dylan
it still just returns nylon so the only thing that a map does is
spit the hot fire right and so here we wind up with best wrappers of all time
just being dylon dylon dylon and then for the last the last

01:53
two things to add here we unshift dylon onto the front and we
push dylon onto the back and so when we console log the best wrappers of all
time we have dailon dailon dailon dylan and dailon beautiful alrighty folks
we have another review to do but since we're at the top of the hour let's take
our break let's take our break let's put five
minutes on the clock here folks five minutes on the clock
we're new around here we like to be healthy we like to take our break [Music]
pull in there add it two minutes to the timer let's go ahead and this is now a
seven minute break timer beautiful let's go ahead we're going to take a
seven minute break that hour went fast it sure did and when we come back we're

01:54
gonna do a review and then we get to objects folks i'm super excited to get
the objects all right so let's go and take some minutes on the clock uh if
you're able to please get up and move around i'm going to run the ad so new

01:56

01:57

02:00
folks don't have to worry about it um do [Music] ready 45 seconds left
do you know the total salary of the hundred devs who got jobs
were over four million i gotta add some new folks but we're over four million
now i'm gonna start releasing like what i know about all the folks so we'll

02:01
release kind of like the stats and stuff like that but yeah we're over four mil
all right folks come on back come on back alrighty
alrighty folks come on back come on back let's go ahead and take a look at this
review and then we're going to jump into
objects so it's the alien rangers review go ahead and open that up
we have three questions here and i'm gonna go ahead and put let's put

02:02
five minutes on the timer five minutes on the timer give it your best shot
and then we'll go over it together can we petition them to change unshift
to add to front yes i think it'll be a good petition all right five minutes

02:03
go at it you have it and we'll go over it together you got this folks again
hey glad to hear it phillip best dc superhero does vertigo get put into that
um i mean it's batman like why am i going to front i'm going to be like oh
let me let me impress you with my vast comic book knowledge it's gonna be batman
all right folks three minutes 30 seconds you got this dig deep

02:04
i haven't seen a new one yet i'm still afraid to go to movie theaters soon
what's your favorite megazord now we're talking um
i mean the most nostalgia is definitely the the mighty morphin right you can't
beat that like symbol of your childhood i think when they got to light speed
rescue they did some more interesting stuff like graphically
i have to say mighty morphin ninja storm was pretty cool yeah

02:05
i know party wounds that's true two minutes two minutes
yeah the assembly sequence was pretty lit do you watch any k drama no i have not
ever really got into it i have a feeling that if i did start it'd be a it'd be a
problem for me so how do you all remember this from your
childhood i watch power rangers but i don't remember this stuff because i
watch it as an adult i love power rangers uh
i kind of like stop like anything like after dino thunder is like too much for
me but anything like pre-dino thunder i've probably watched

02:06
all the way through like as as an adult uh the second lowest mean including or
excluding it would it would be including i guess for this example
got some fun some folks coming with the dunzo it's got a few folks that got
something the last one that's okay we're gonna go over it together alrighty
30 seconds left got some dunzo's rolling in
i always wanted that green dagger toy i've been um i was i'm i
i don't know why i'm telling people this

02:07
i i've been 3d printing different swords and that's on my list
i just did some test prints earlier to get a collapsible lightsaber
um but yeah i'm doing a bunch of different like like toy swords
because i i print like i like to print a lot of like i guess it
would be like toy stuff but it's been fun i have my bulbasaur right here i print
it which i really liked yeah that came out clean looks pretty good
to me a 3d printer is like the best the best toy you could ever give a kid
because you can get printers now like i know 200 is not is nothing to
slouch about but for like less than like a um
less than like a gaming console they can build whatever toy they want like the
plastic's like ten dollars and then for like half of a gaming
console they can build whatever toy they ever want and they're all like free

02:08
online yeah that's pretty dope to me all right folks come on back come on
back let's go over this together yeah it's i i use my 3d printer for d2
like i have a bunch of miniatures that i've printed off that was pretty cool
there was a humble bundle that had a lot
of like really good miniatures in it and i've been using those
first one done hey caleb that's awesome congrats
all right let's come on back let's go through it
we're printer to use i have an ender 3v2 um i have the bl touch mod on it a new
hot end some other like fancy stuff glass plate but not too many mods i'm
putting octoprint on it today well hopefully this week yeah
anyone else immediately undoing the timers yes i hope you do some folks like

02:09
the complete silence some don't so i like to just keep talking because
i think some folks just prefer that in the background but always feel free to
mute me that's why i leave the timer up right the timer i leave up so if you
don't want to hear me blab on you can just mute me and then see the timer go
off and come on back alrighty create an array of tv shows loop through
and print each show to the console so let's go ahead and we're just going to
start off by um putting our we'll just use the same
shows we did last time let's do power rangers to let power rangers equal
and then we're going to go ahead and do mighty morphin
here's my thing about power rangers though they they had new power rangers
move but they didn't do it right the way you do hold on
the way you do a modern power rangers movie is thus you know cloverfield
right cloverfield is like dark and they're like on a roof there's a bunch

02:10
of like teenagers hanging out right and then like something starts to attack you
don't know what's attacking but it's just like these like cool kids hanging
out it's really dark it's gritty if you had gone to cloverfield
having no idea what it was and they're just like these older teenagers hanging
out on a roof someone starts attacking and they all just go it's boyfriend time
you would have lost your absolute like you would have lost your mind right like
you just would have been it would have it would have blown your mind that's how
you do a new power rangers movie you don't tell anyone it's a power rangers
movie you just let some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go down and
then right as it's about to get really bad you just go
morph in time and then like everyone like
if i see that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out if i was a
billionaire that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i would do
no build up no hype you're going there for something completely different and
then your mind's just blown that it's a power rangers movie that's how you do it

02:11
all right mighty morphin uh we'll say alien rangers
i spell right ally in rangers and then we'll say um
neo beautiful now we have our tv shows loop through and print each one to the
console so what type of loops could we use here
what kind of loops could we use here we use a for loop just like a generic
for loop we can use a for each let's use the for each because we we've been we
want to get some practice in let's go ahead and do power rangers and we'll do
four each and then we're going to take in
uh each each value so we'll just say um uh show
and we will we're gonna print each one to the console so we'll just console.log
log each show and so what this is going to do
is we're gonna run once for each element in the array we have

02:12
one two three elements in the array so this four each will run three times
each time it's gonna run it's gonna be the goblins to run and grab mighty
morphin and then plug it into show then it's going to grab alien rangers
and plug it in the show and then it's going to grab neo and plug it into show
i'm saying neo instead of zeo is this you or yeah i keep saying neo i don't
know i keep saying neo zio could you imagine all right
and so what winds up happening is that mighty morphin gets console logged
then alien rangers gets console logged and then zeo gets console logged
right beautiful i did just watch the the matrix yeah that's why alrighty
let's uh let's save this and let's make sure this john actually runs
good let's open this in the browser look at that that's so fire

02:13
this is why alien rangers are the best look at this i'd wear that right now
get me this black fit it's over kanye might have changed his life but
i'm still an old-school gemini look at that fire all right let's refresh
we don't actually have anything printing to the console let's go back and take a
look why did nothing print to the console bark said save my guy exactly let's go
ahead and save we didn't save so now we can come back and refresh second try

02:14
we got mighty morphin we got alien rangers and we got zeo
that that's that's that's the whole that's the second layer of this stream
is i just say a lot of stuff and if you know you know but most of the time it's
just rap lyrics so a lot of stuff i say is like not actually true it's just rap
lyrics so if you're in you're in if you're out you're out i don't know i
can't i can't i can't help you all righty
quick maths indeed return a new array of numbers that includes every even number
from the previous array so oh sorry we have to create an array of numbers and
then we have a second prompt here so let's go and create array of numbers
let numbs equal and let's just throw some give me some numbers chat can you
give me some numbers please 21 of course 56 88 24 99 and 710.

02:15
cool all right thank you for those numbers all right let's return a new array of
num return a new array of numbers that includes every even number from the
previous arrays so only a new array that only has even numbers so
let's go ahead and let's just do this as like an arrow function um let
only only evens only evens equal and then we know we're going to pass in
an array we're passing in an array and that array
we want to get just the even numbers so did anybody know something we can do
to get only even numbers is there like a method or something that we could use
yeah we can use a filter method with modulus so let's try the filter method

02:16
so we'll do array.filter and the cool thing about filter is it
runs once for each element in the array and it checks to see if something is
true if it is true it includes it in that new array
so let's go ahead and take a look at it so we can filter we said we're going to
do excuse me let's go ahead and say array filter we're going to take in a value
num and we'll say well num is modulus two if that equals zero
so that equals zero then we know that it's true that should work
like if the number modulus two all right let's let's see let's see
where i'm at with this one real quick um let
oh sorry let's console.log don't worry i'm gonna come back to let me let me see

02:17
where i'm at console.log only evens and let's pass in nums
all right let's see where we're at i mean let me add some spacing here so
people can see what we're doing let's save this all right and let's refresh
cool so we have a an array that got console logged
that has 56 88 24 and 7 10 in it first uh and so that was only the even numbers
that were in that nums array so let's take a look and
see where this comes from so here's our nums array and here we have a function
called only evens only evens here we have an arrow function
what i am doing is i am going to this is going to be a function that will work
with any array right it'll work with any
array and so i know i'm going to pass in an array so i name my parameter array

02:18
right i name my parameter array then i run the filter method on that array
it's the same thing as running the map that we had right like the map we had
before it filters just another method built into javascript that can do some
heavy lifting for us what the filter will do
is it's going to help us set up a new array just like map sets up a new array
filter set up a new array and to add a value to this new array
this statement winds up having to be true so if it's not true we don't add that
value to the array so the very first time this runs we are filtering through
nums because nums is the array that we pass in we called only evens
and we pass in nums so wherever we see array is

02:19
nums so that means array right now is holding the 21 56 88 24. 99 and the 7
10. so how many times is this filter going to run
how many times is this filter going to run just like map would run multiple
times how many times is the filter going to run yes
the filter is going to run six times there are six numbers in the array
right there are six six elements in the array so this filter is going to run six
times now the very first time it runs what is n the very first time

02:20
21 21 21 21 21 all right so does 21 modulus 2 equal 0. no
21 is not an even number 2 does not go into it evenly so that that's a false so
do we add 21 to our new array nope all right next we're going to try 56
wherever i see n it's actually 56 does 56 mod 2 equals zero
yep so then we add 56 to our new array and we get a new n now it's 88
does 88 mod 2 equals zero yep so we add 88 to our new array then we try 24

02:21
is 24 mod 2 equal to 0 yes we add 24. now is 99 mod 2 equal to 0 no
2 does not go into 99 evenly so do we add it to our array
nope we do not add it to our array and then the very last time this runs n is 7
10. is 7 10 modulus 2 equal to 0 yes 2 goes into 710 evenly and so we add 7 10
to our new array now the funny thing is this new array
what happens to this new array look right here we talked about this earlier
this new array is created right here what do we wind up doing with the new
array that we just created there's something very specific that's going to
happen here there's something that when we use the arrow functions that happens

02:22
yeah it's an implicit return so that means that the new array that we
just created it gets returned to where it's called
so it's as though only evens was not here but our new array holding 56 88 24
and 710 that gets put into the new array and that's what gets console logged
right so the beauty here is that the filter
is going to create a new array for us and then whenever it's done creating
that new array it gets returned to where it was called
and that's why we see the new array being console logged
what does the n mean it's just a parameter just like array is a parameter uh
they're just parameters we're going to call them anything we call it we could
have called it robot and unicorn and it wouldn't have mattered
cool if this is tripping you up don't worry this is like the first time we're

02:23
seeing arrow functions in the wild come on sunday and we'll redo some
problems like this where we'll do it without arrow functions and with arrow
functions uh so we can see both ways cool last one here create a function
that takes in an array of numbers right create a function that takes in an
array of numbers alert the sum of the second lowest and the second highest
number so we already have nums so let's just use
um well it says create a function let's create a function let's start there
function um sum of the second and highest lowest so we're gonna do uh sum second
low and high there we go so we know we're gonna take

02:24
in an array of numbers so i'm just gonna call our parameter array
and we're going to return the sum of the
second lowest and the second highest now if i want to make my life easy
right i want to make my life easy how can i get my numbers in a way that i could
grab the second highest and the second lowest
yeah i could just sort them if i if i just sort them
i just sort them then i can um then i can just then i can just use the
indexes right i can just go one in and two from the end and grab them and i
should be good so i i see your i see your stretch when she i got you after
after let's do this real quick so um let's call let's sort it
equal and all i'm going to do is sort the array array.sort

02:25
and then i'm going to take in a and b and boop a minus b this is how
you sort numbers in an array now let me ask you
how do you think i was able to bang that out so quickly
is it something that i just implicitly knew because i am a elite developer no
this is something that i learned way back in the day from coding challenges
probably from code wars right this sorting is something that i had to
figure out how to do to solve a code wars and then once i learned it for the
code wars i added it to my anki deck and this pops up once every i don't know
year or so because i've seen it so many times right but it's not something that
i would know just because like i know how to code it's something that i

02:26
researched to solve a code wars i said hey this sorting thing is probably
really really beneficial i added it to my anki deck and i review
it constantly so when i do see this problem come up again this pattern comes
up where i have to to to get numbers in a certain order boom sort it and call it
a day so hint these things to your anki deck we've
showed a lot of stuff today that should definitely be in your enkei we saw a
filter for really the first time we saw a four each again we're seeing a sort
these are things that you need to come back to you need to spend some time with
these outside of class to see how they work to see how they how that how like
you break them down um the reading and the videos also work
through a lot of this stuff as well so it all kind of comes together to see it
but it definitely needs to be in your anki
when i add it to my anki how is it it's just this
how do you sort an array of numbers and on this other side would be this

02:27
literally this exact code cool so now we have sorted numbers
and we want to alert the sum so we know we're going to wind up adding two
numbers now that my numbers are sorted how can i get the second lowest number
what's happening with the a and b it really doesn't matter this is just how
you sort from low to high in in javascript you
can reverse the bna and go from high to low that's kind of what's happening it's
just it's just the specific way that we're sorting once we get to our data
structures and algorithms at the end of the cohort we'll really break down
what's happening inside this sort function to need the a and b but at this
point you really don't need to know what's happening inside the sort
function because we're not trying to write super efficient code yet but when
we get to our data structures and algorithms in the course we'll break that down

02:28
cool our numbers are sorted right there's a lot of weird things that we
could do i'm seeing some folks pop some folks are saying pop the min and max
and then you're left with like easier numbers i'm seeing some splicing and
some slicing and stuff like that um but we know that the lowest number
would be array what what index would be the lowest number yeah
array zero will be the lowest number so the the highest number
the highest number has to be sorry the second lowest if the lowest
number is is index zero the second lowest would be what
one exactly so we know the second lowest would be one because the lowest is zero
and we're going to add that to the second highest so we've seen this before
where we do array and we do dot length uh minus what would give us the highest

02:29
number right what would give us sorry yes it's
sorted not array good call good call it's sorted sorted as our sorted array
whoops good eye thank you for that um beautiful because we're dealing with our
sorted array right so not our original array so if we wanted to get the the
highest number it'd be minus one but we want the second highest so it'll
be minus two right and then let's go ahead and
call this function and pass in some numbers so we're gonna sum
second low and high and let's pass in some numbers let's pass in
um let's just do let's do one two three four and five but let's mix them
two three four one let's do one five four there we go so we have one two

02:30
three four and five all mixed up and so if we want the the second highest
and lowest we should see two and four be added together for six so if this
works we should have six so let's save this let's go back
i should have my sword printed already this wouldn't fire add that sword up
there oh that would have been legit all right anyway let's refresh
and we can see the six gets alerted right so it worked the two and the four
got added together we got the six alerted beautiful all right
so we saw some sorting we we used the the knowledge of our
indexes to grab the second lowest and the second highest we added them
together and then we alerted them beautiful
thank you enlightened that's beautiful to hear brook that's awesome here cool

02:31
all right now i need i need to i owe a stretch so let me do my stretch you know
if you want that good good content you got to start yoloing some more channel
points to get the of uh run second hmm oh yeah alrighty folks
we got through some review if you want to see more
if you want to see more of these types of practices where we're using more
methods we're using arrow functions we're starting to like do things in
slightly different ways and you want to see me review it with regular functions
and then try it with the arrow functions come sunday sunday we're going to do
some questions like always but we're going to spend a lot of time with

02:32
methods uh so if you want to come back and see these methods you want to see
more arrow functions let's do that review on sunday together
hippie sue hey thank you for the five gifted subs thank you for being here
alrighty let's get to the goods today folks the goods are objects so
objects are really the last puzzle piece that we need to
kind of start building some really dope stuff
once we understand objects your mind you become you become enlightened in terms
of javascript there's gonna be we're gonna we're gonna set some some things
up today and then i am literally going to blow your mind on thursday like your
mind will be obliterated on thursday in in the best way possible so we're gonna
touch on objects right now get the get the juices flowing and then come
thursday just mine explosion uh so let's get into it

02:33
the wonderful thing about javascript is that every single thing is a what
is an object keep that thought in your mind every single thing is out there get
down your mind what objects are are collections of variables and functions
if you look at an object all it really is is a collection of
variables and functions just like the variables and functions that we've
already seen and these variables and functions
they represent the attributes and the behavior
of that object now when we're talking about objects we call the attributes
properties and we call those functions we call those

02:34
methods so the variables we call sorry the variables we call properties and the
functions we call methods the attributes we would call our properties and the
behaviors we would call our methods and so at first it's kind of hard to wrap
our brain around so let's think of an actual physical object
like something that we could really think of right uh for me right now i'm
thinking of my water bottle so i have a nice nalgene bottle here full of
delicious ice water one second now this water bottle has some
attributes and behaviors it has some properties and some methods
what is an attribute of this water bottle it has a lid color of black it has a

02:35
full property of 50 well 60 it has a shape property of cylinder it has a brand
of nalgene right so we can think of all these different physical attributes
that describe this water bottle right not only its shape and color but
also kind of like how full it is like all the different
things we could use to describe the attributes of this water bottle
now what are some of the behaviors of this water bottle
what's something that it can do it can open right make you pee
it can open and close open and close so there are attributes that describe this

02:36
water bottle but there are also behaviors that describe this water
bottle like opening and closing beautiful let's continue this
train of thought with an object that we can all think about and let's think
about a stopwatch what are some attributes of this stopwatch
this is a physical object that has some attributes what are some attributes of
the stopwatch now don't don't throw out the value a
lot of folks are throwing out the value this has a color attribute that has a
value of black we want to say the attribute is black we would say that the color
attribute is black how about the shape attribute the shape attribute is round

02:37
the brand attribute is accusplit the model attribute is pro survivor the minutes
attribute is set to three the seconds attribute is set to 59. hey thank you
for the hype train everybody uh the milliseconds
property or attribute is set to 45. so we can think about a physical
a physical stopwatch and think through all these attributes of this object yeah
its shape its brand its color all these different things that make up the
physical attributes of this object but a stopwatch also has some behaviors
what are some behaviors of this stopwatch yeah it can start it can stop
it can split it can beep right so there are a lot of behaviors that this

02:38
stopwatch has and so when we think about physical objects we can think about
their attributes and we can think about their behaviors
and when we think about these objects it's the same thing when it gets to code
arc our objects in javascript are going to have some attributes and they're
going to have some behaviors when it comes to javascript
objects we call those attributes properties and we call those behaviors methods
and underneath the hood our properties are really just variables
color equals this shape equals this and our methods are really just functions
sets of instructions so when you think of objects in terms of
javascript just think of regular old objects in regular meat space they have

02:39
properties and they have methods you might have
called them attributes and behaviors but it's the same thing
when we look at the stopwatch we can do the same exercise again and we can say
the color property is black the brand property is accusplit the val
the the the minutes property is three the seconds property is 59 right and we
can say that the the actual methods that this stopwatch
object has is start stop split beep all these wonderful things cool
so here is what that actually looks like we can create a object using literal
notation just like we saw literal notation with
an array using square brackets we can literally create an object using curly

02:40
braces and so here i have created a stopwatch object
using literal notation which means curly braces
then right here i have set up current time and current time is the first what on
this stopwatch current time is a what we talked about objects having two things
so current time is the first what yeah it's the first property right it's
the first property the current time property is set to 12.
next if we look at stopwatch you can see that we're setting up tell time
and without having to really know too much about our objects we know that
telltime is a what it's not a property it's something else
yeah it's a method how do we know that tell time is a method

02:41
what's the dead giveaway that tell time is a method
it's snitched on itself yeah it's a function right whenever you have
an object and you're setting something about it to a function
dead stop it's a method as soon as you set tell time equal to a
function you have a method so right off the bat we can see that our objects
can have properties like current time and methods like tell time
a property is going to be some value and a tell time is going to be a value
that is a method it's always going to be a value that is a function
so if you're ever looking at an object and you see it set equal to a function
you're going to call that a method anything else you're going to call it a
property so the cool thing is we can use these
properties and methods just like we would use any other variables and

02:42
functions and so once we have set up these properties and
methods we can start to use them so here we have stopwatch dot current time
ignore this stuff here and ignore the parentheses if you're just looking at
stopwatch dot current time what does that equal
stopwatch that current time equals what yeah equals 12.
it's the same thing as slapping 12 in there because you can see we created our
object and we gave it the current time property
of 12. we can always ask for that property back from the stopwatch object
by using this notation anybody know what kind of notation this is called
has that has a very specific name what type of notation is that did you get it
from the reading yeah it's called dot notation we can use dot notation

02:43
to add a property or add a method but we can also use dot notation to consume we
can get the current time right so right here we know that stopwatch that current
time is the same thing as grabbing 12. so wherever i see stopwatch.currenttime
it's the same thing as 12. now if we ignore this for a second
and we look at tell time how could we tell that tell time
was a method even if we couldn't see it up here
in this instance how could i tell that tell time was a method even if i
didn't see the function above yeah exactly tell time has the parentheses

02:44
right so if we were to write this out stop watch dot tell
time just the parentheses open and close you can see that it has the parentheses
whenever you see those parentheses what is that what is it what are we trying to
do what are we trying to do exactly we're trying to call
whenever you see those whenever you see those parentheses we're trying to make a
function call and so if we're making a function call
and it's tied to something else right it's tied to something else right
if we're trying to make a function call and it's tied to stopwatch right it's no
longer just a function it's a what if we're trying to make that function
call and it's tied to the stopwatch object it's no longer just a function

02:45
it's a what it's a method exactly when our functions are tied to objects
we call them methods and when we have individual variables tied to our
objects we call those properties so here we can see a property tied to our
stopwatch object and we can see a tell time method tied to our stop watch object
now shadow said can you use current time inside the function
heck yes we can let me show you why right right we can for sure so
stopwatch that current time evaluates to what what does it evaluate to
it evaluates to 12. so what we wind up really doing is stop watch tell time

02:46
but we pass in 12. we pass in 12. so that means we're going to pass 12 into tell
time so here's our function for tell time that 12 it's passed in
wherever i see time i see 12. so console log the current time is 12.
and so that's how we can use the properties and the methods together
right we can use the properties and methods together we had one we had one
stopwatch object that came with a property and it came with a method the
property was the current time and the method was tell time and we were able to
use those together to start to do some cool stuff we can run that telltime

02:47
method and we can actually pass in the current time if we want
so objects are like customized methods well you can think of objects having
their own functions which can be customized and those are methods all right
let's go ahead and try writing some code to make this make
a little bit more sense right let's try writing some code to
make this make a little bit more sense let's look at the objects zeo so if we
look go to objects here we have zeo and in this object zeo
i want you to create a stopwatch object that has four properties
and three methods right create a stopwatch object has four
properties and three methods i'm gonna get i'm only gonna give you three minutes
three minutes to try and bang this out look at look at the look at the past
uh the past slide if you need to so three minutes and we're going to go over

02:48
it together stopwatch obviously has four properties
and three methods try it even if it's not making sense look at the slide and
use your good old 100 devs try to make it look the same here
four properties three methods three minutes go for it
put the other slide up so folks can see it four properties you can see adding a
property here and a meth and and the methods
daddy's home 420 hey thank you for the hydration cheers to you

02:49
a lot of this should have been reviewed folks a lot of this should have been
review this is this is in the reading minutes two minutes
uh diego you haven't sent me a whisper diego

02:50
so if we don't have your whisper i'm gonna have to pick the raid [Music]
all right folks 45 seconds you got this oh we got some duns coming in i'd like

02:51
to see it [Music] all righty eight seconds we're gonna go over it together
we're gonna maybe maybe slightly blow your mind just
a little bit before we get to thursday's class
all right let's come back let's go over this together alrighty
so i wanted a stopwatch object so the first thing i need to do right
the first thing i need to do is create the stopwatch object so i'm going to go
ahead and do let stop watch equal and then my curly braces
what type of notation did i just use right what notation i just used to

02:52
create the object literal notation exactly i literally created the object
on thursday we'll see constructors and some other fun stuff ways to create
objects beautiful so let's add four properties uh i'm gonna imagine like a
nike stopwatch so i'm going to go ahead and say stopwatch dot brand equals nike
okay then the stopwatch dot color let's keep it the same as the picture
we'll say black and then um actually i'm gonna keep it lowercase
i don't get in trouble there [Music] stopwatch dot
what are some other properties that you all thought through
what are some other properties that you thought through shape i like shape

02:53
let's say shape equals round and what else um size okay stopwatch
dot size and we can set it equal to medium there we go medium um
we got our shapeshifters medium and that's our four properties and so the
cool thing is if we were to open this in the browser
right if we were to open this in the browser let's go ahead and open it
let's go ahead and open it all right let's look in the inspector
go to our console here oh i failed to load the image
it failed to load the image uh why didn't the image work anyway
we can ask for this stopwatch right since we since we're in the console we

02:54
can ask for stopwatch so if we type in stopwatch
you can see that we get back the stopwatch that we just created
right we got we get back to stopwatch we just created we have brand color
shape and size on the stopwatch that we created so we can actually ask for
stopwatch dot brand and it would give us back nike right we could ask for
stopwatch dot shape and get back round because we declared
the variable stopwatch and literally created an object and then we added the
properties one by one we could if we wanted to as we create the object have done
brand and then did nike right then we could have done color and do black

02:55
that's a little too much to get started with so for what i did for now is i just
literally declared my object and then i did them all on individual
lines so they could actually see it but you could actually do it all if you did
the reading it could all be done uh inside of the curly braces if you want
it but this is this is readable for now and we'll get some some other ways to do
it later all right so we have our four properties and then let's go ahead and
create the methods so the ones we kind of already said i
think i wanted to use so let's go ahead and do start
and i'm going to set that equal to a what if i want this to be a method start
has to be equal to what has to be equal to a function so i'll
make this a function and we're going to say just we're going

02:56
to like console.log starting starting boom all right
that's lock starting wonderful and then we're going to go ahead and do stop
i'm going to do the same thing equals function
and we're just going to console.log stopping
can you do with an arrow function you could you could um stopping and then i
want one more which is beep so oh we could we could say um i like beep
or let's let's make it say something set a beep stopwatch dot say
say say say brand there we go we'll set that equal to a function
and will console log and what could i pass in here so that it says the brand

02:57
what could i do so that it says the brand we could hard code it we can just hard
code it for right now we could eventually get to something
called like this but that's a little too advanced for today we're gonna say
stopwatch dot brand because we know that this right now
stopwatch.brand is nike right so this would only work for this stopwatch but
eventually we'll get to this and it could be more
interchangeable all right let's go ahead and save all this we got our four
properties we got our three methods looks good to me let's come back look in
the console let's refresh so if we ask for stopwatch
we can see everything that's stored in memory right now for stopwatch we can see
all of the brands the colors but we can also see these other things in there
what what what else have we added to this stopwatch object that the console

02:58
can show us what have we added yeah we've added our methods exactly
we've added our methods and so inside of the terminal
we can actually use these we can do stopwatch dot
um size and get back medium but let's try running some of the methods stopwatch
dot start if i just did this something weird would
happen if i if i want my methods to run what do i need
i want my methods to run what do i need i need my parentheses so right now i
don't have my parentheses if i just hit enter
i get the function declaration back right i get the function declaration
back but it didn't actually run it's just showing me
what i have stored into memory but it didn't actually run if you want your
methods to run you have to use the parentheses so boom
i hit enter now and you can see it logged to the console starting
right log the console starting and then we can also do the stay brand so

02:59
stopwatch that say brand and once again if i want it to run i need
my parentheses to make it a call boom you can see that it console logged the
brand which was nike i looked at stopwatch dot brand
it was nike so this this method of say brand actually
actually works it said the brand that it was which is nike
why does it say undefined because there was no return
it was expecting a return and i didn't have a return in my methods don't worry
about it yet yeah that's something we'll get to later on cool alrighty
cool so we we hit some things here we we have some
some properties that we can use on our objects and we have some methods that we

03:00
can use on our objects now can i just can can just give me give me a few
seconds here i just want to tease your brain just a little bit just a little
bit and then third is i'm going to like blow it
all right if we look back at some of the stuff we did earlier today like leo no
look at back some of the stuff we did earlier today let's um let's look at
this one that we just did recently here i grabbed the length of sorted
what does length look like right now based on what we just learned tonight
about objects what does length look like it looks like a property but you're
saying leon sorted is a what though sorted as a what
sorted is an array right here but we're using length huh filter
looks like a what let's get rid of stuff that's inside of here

03:01
filter looks like a what a method huh but it's it's working on an array
we've been seeing these properties and these methods since the beginning
we saw math.min math.max we saw two string we saw some these these methods
and properties that we've been using this whole time interesting i say
interesting indeed and that's because every single thing in
javascript is an object does it matter if it's an array a string
of whatever anything we've seen so far it's all been a lie
it's all been objects this whole time so

03:02
on thursday we'll make that mind-bending idea come to life
we'll see how we can start to really use objects we're gonna we're gonna peek
underneath the javascript hood and see how everything really is objects
alrighty folks a huge thank you to everyone this evening hitting a hundred
jobs was a huge milestone uh something i'm super proud of and i'm super proud
of this community every single day you show up you put in the work you help
others let's uh keep the positivity going we're gonna go ahead and do a raid um
the person that redeemed it didn't actually whisper me
um so i didn't see that come through so i've already queued up a different raid
um diego we can do a different raid the other
on thursday if you want um but we're going to go to uh nick
who's doing a competitive data visualization we've been there to them
before but they're doing something special today let's go ahead and give

03:03
them some love if you haven't given them a follow they definitely deserve it
go ahead and let's go and set that up beautiful alrighty folks
hope you had some fun reviewing arrays seeing some of our newer ways to handle
things like arrow functions some more methods uh we're going to do more object
practice on thursday don't worry if this is your first time seeing objects we'll
get into it on thursday we'll have more fun we'll make it make more sense
thank you so much for 100 jobs it means a lot it means a lot that you're all
here you continue to show up continue to put in the hard work we're just getting
started folks next week best week ever let's raid
