and the the the subs are are um just y'all
hope y'all doing well everybody welcome back welcome back let's get in here
today is today's a real one that's all i'm going to say today's a real one
uh we do have as always question of the day and it's very on point today
question of the day is would you rather carry boats or logs
hey thank you for the five get the subs would you rather carry the boats
would you rather carry the logs you got to carry some of them so what are you
logs or boats boats logs are too rolly but if i carry the logs who's going to

00:07
carry the boats they haven't thought of this yet i haven't thought about it yet
there's people that are just confused they're like leon i i didn't check the
uh the the message on discord i didn't i didn't open the
email so this boats and lock stuff i don't know what everybody's talking
about but uh already folks get in here get in here as
always i like to start off with some questions
so give me some questions while we let folks run to your computer
i got some some water today straight water bankers only
pasta or pizza pasta all day long hydro homies of course
who you got for the super bowl i think somebody asked me in the ask leon

00:08
channel and my response was google's who's playing in the super bowl
i'm in la uh so i think i have to do the ramps but i always liked the bangles
when i was growing up yeah i said it that way yeah i think i'm going with the
did some networking a that's just how i secure the bag
what's the next step in an interview maybe even talk how do i approach the
situation moving forward so if you're already networking and meet and meeting
people keep it casual at first you don't have to go straight for the jugular
right keep kind of keep in touch keep giving them value uh stay stay in their
radar and then once we get through like node is when it gets a little bit more
serious with the job hunt so for now just say hey like it was great meeting
you give them some value and say hey i would love to connect in like another
month or so and i'm starting to look for
opportunities yeah don't go straight for the jugular keep it keep it friendly

00:09
right can we get jobs at fang with just this boot camp
we had a lot of people that did it last cohort but i don't i don't want you to
go to fang i i don't i think there's so many other
wonderful startups companies out there that pay really well have great uh
great work life balance that you don't have to buy into the hype
did you start pokemon yet no not yet are we looking for the basic layouts to
be just like the photos uh we're going to talk about that today we're going to
talk we're going to talk through each layout we're going to walk through each
one together we gave a little bit more time for the
homework so we start javascript next week hold up
what yes that's right javascript next thursday me you
4 000 plus other people we're doing that thing so really

00:10
tonight and tuesday's class are our kind of last first dabbles with html and css
we move right into javascript and then once we have enough javascript
we have the ability to build beautiful front ends we'll come back we'll add
more css and javascript we start add more css and html but we keep it moving
and that's the thing the thing is that you don't need to over invest
in html and css early on you got the basics we're going to keep it moving on
tuesday we're going to touch more about flexbox we'll do a little bit of flexbox
we'll do a few layouts with flexbox and then we move straight on that's it we
keep it moving once we have the ability to build stuff
right like once we have html css and javascript you'll be building real front
ends so i like to get away from html and
css pretty quickly because we don't have
all the tools on our tool belt yet right we have all the tools in our tool belt

00:11
yet so we can't we can't really do too much but once we're building full
stack web applications then we come back to it we add in more stuff that we need
to make it happen but here's the thing you you already have everything you need
you already have everything you need you don't need more you just don't
if you're building these layouts with floats you're good move on you're good
people are like what about flex what about grid you don't need it just move
on nobody's going to hire you because you're really good at flexbox let me say
it one more time nobody's going to hire you because you're really good at
flexbox that's just not going to happen you're not going to get a job because
you're great at flexbox right so we move on to get the skills that you
actually need to get a job right you have enough to get your hands dirty
right you have enough to build the basics of what you need to build right
and on and on tuesday we'll play a little bit with flex right

00:12
but don't over invest we got to keep it moving
are they going to hire me for being good at floats hell no hell though
there are very few jobs out there for folks with just html and css skills do
they exist yes but a lot of people get caught up in
this idea of like i'm going to be a front-end developer and all i'm going to
do is write html and css those jobs are few and far between maybe if you're
writing html emails or maybe if you're attached like a marketing like a
marketing team and that's all you're turning out but um
that's that's that's like those are the only jobs front end is gonna be a lot
more javascript a lot more other stuff built in and so we got to keep adding
those tools to our tool belt there ain't no jobs out there for what we just have

00:13
right now betty's checking um thank you for the questions i think we
got folks coming in so let's go ahead and talk about something special that
happened today folks so on tuesday's class since we had our
lovely networking night and shout out to everyone that came to the networking
night we had over 3 000 people on remo let's sink that in for a little bit
we had over 3 000 plus people on remo networking meeting each other
hanging out i know shuffle gate happened and some people got shuffle locked
but we still had so many folks that got to interact got to
do their first maybe real world networking
it was really beautiful to see so many folks say like leon i was terrified of
it but it wasn't so bad that's kind of where i want you to be

00:14
with the networking it might be super terrifying but slowly
you start to realize maybe it's not so bad all right it worked
i loved it hey i'm glad that you some of you all enjoyed it i know that remote
could be finicky but here here's the real truth
with the amount of people we have right we have three four five thousand
people showing up to a class right now we still about five thousand peak each
class like we still each class break over five thousand we sit around four
thousand something concurrent right with that amount of people
it's really hard to find a platform where they're not just talking wild to me
i got on the phone with some people that run these platforms and they're like oh
yeah one event that'll be a cool 10 000. like what excuse me what
uh so yeah we're gonna we're gonna have to keep it hacky
we're gonna keep it hacky we're gonna keep it uh
we had to split it out across six groups

00:15
i didn't get any angry emails so i think it worked uh
but i know remo could be finicky for some folks but it's what we got to do to
make it happen uh we're looking at other platforms but at this size boy
boy does it get expensive so we used what we had we made it work
next time i won't shuffle and i think more people will get through it no
all right now the other thing that i wanted to bring up was that at the end of
that like networking session i sent out a follow-up message on discord like i
always do and at the end i said hey we didn't do a raid
sam hey thank you for the sub cool problem to have yeah true true story right um
we didn't have a raid so i said hey let's raid uh
youtube video and i said if we got him over

00:16
a thousand subs on on youtube i would do the first bit of merch
so that's true that's what happened we did the first bit of merch
and we're going we got over a thousand i don't know where they're at right now

you're not subscribed to newsletter i recommend you do it uh and that way you
can see cool stuff uh every once while i
throw i throw like a raffle in the right at the bottom of the email just as
something for fun alrighty get real we talked a lot about who's going to

00:30
carry the boats and the logs and that's what we're here to talk about tonight
and uh this this class is going to be a little bit
shorter than normal because i really do want you all to have more time for those
layouts right so i extended the deadline for the layouts to not next tuesday
but next thursday but i added an extra one or two okay so you got more time
you got the weekend on tuesday we're gonna spend time doing
some of the layouts together we're going to be using some flexbox we're going to
be doing some fun stuff uh with the layouts but i'm going to give you some
more time i want you to have the time that you need to kind of get through
these before we jump into javascript there's also some stuff to watch so you
got a little bit more time but you got a little bit more work and a little bit
more things to do so i hope that it helps
can you use flexbox you can if you want i recommend that you do them all with

00:31
floats yeah i recommend you all doing with floats
and then if you want to push and you want to go deeper redo them with flexbox
do them with both right if you have the time all right
yes it's uncommon to have an html and css job only do they exist absolutely
but they're typically lower paid and a little bit less common to run into
but they exist we have some folks that from last cohort that do uh just html
and css but yeah they're smaller cool all right
the reason i asked you all to watch the carry the boats in the logs video is for
a very very important reason uh we are entering the trough of sorrow

00:32
right we are entering the trough with sorrow but we have not yet hit the bottom
let me say it again we have we have not yet hit the bottom okay and
the reason why i bring this up is because you are about to enter in to a phase
you you're at a point where it's a decision-making time
right you're at a point where i've seen over the past 10 years thousands of
students hundreds of jobs you're at a a very very special point
in the trough of sorrow and this trough of sorrow is a little incorrect
the trough of sorrow actually has as you're going down the wearing off of
novelty like as you come off of udemy hill and you're going down the wearing
off of novelty that that that hill has a little gap in it right it has a little

00:33
little gap in it and that gap is a very very important gap to bring up
you all have now had a taste of what it's like to be in this class
right a taste a small taste you gave me a month which is what i asked right
is what i asked and now you get to make a decision
in that month do you feel like you've grown
in that month do you feel like you've learned
in that month do you feel like you found a community that can help support you
right because if you have then i really hope that you can jump across this gap
and crash into the bottom of the trough of sorrow
but i always want to make sure that i highlight a very very important point
about this gap this gap is a point of privilege

00:34
and it's where a lot of folks fall through before they even get to the bottom of
the trough of sorrow a lot of folks that make it to this point
but don't make it to the end it's really a bulk of the time this gap
and this gap is the privilege of having your life come together in this moment
right in this moment to then make it through the rest of the trough of sorrow
not everyone can pull life together in this moment to
get across this gap and we have some folks that will fall through
and the reason why i bring it up is because i don't want you
to beat yourself up i want you to forgive yourself if this moment is not

00:35
the moment for you we are about to embark on something that is a long trough
of sorrow you will be you're starting to see the
amount of work that it takes the time in class
the time outside of class the homework the networking is now becoming a thing
daily coding challenges are becoming a thing there's more stuff that are going
to be put on the pile as we turn things up and
not everyone will have the privilege of life coming together enough to make it
across this gap the folks that have the opportunity
right the folks that have the opportunity they can pull life together
they can get across that gap they typically make it to the end

00:36
because you have to make a choice if you are lucky enough
to have the things going in your favor you have access to a computer you have
access to the internet you have access to time you have access to maybe someone
watching the kids while you're in class you have access to all these things that
make it so that you can jump across the gap my ask to you
is that you don't waste it not everyone gets this opportunity
and so i don't want you to waste it cool now the next 25 weeks
are going to be tough and i i just want to say it one more time about this gap
this gap has nothing to do with aptitude

00:37
this app has nothing to do with how good you are at math this gap has nothing to
do with your typing speed this gap has nothing to do with your logic or
reasoning skills it's about life coming together right
if it is and you make it across the gap then it comes down to the key things
that we've been talking about from day one
it's about managing your frustration if you have the privilege of being able to
jump across that gap and hurdle yourself into the bottom of the trough of sorrow
it's going to come down to managing your frustration
the reason why i know that you're not at the bottom of the trough of sorrow is
because you still have a little bit of hope left in you all right
look you're still holding on to some threads uh that this will be okay right

00:38
but this will be okay that there's like this internal voice
that's saying to you i'm gonna be okay i'm gonna make it i'm gonna do it
the moment that voice turns off and the demon comes out that tells you i
can't do this i won't be able to network i won't be able to learn javascript i
won't be able to like as soon as that demon comes out that's
when you're in the trough of sorrow when it's full
blaring in the back of your head right right full blaring in the back of your
head the the the kind whispers that used to be there aren't there anymore
that's when you know you're in the trough of sorrow at the bottom
right when it feels like you can't catch up
when it feels like things are getting too tough things are piling on when it
feels like there's not any light at the end of the trough

00:39
that's when you're at the bottom but i'm here to tell you
this community has seen hundreds of people in that darkest moment do one really
important thing i'm going to jump ahead here i want to
jump ahead to it because i think it's important to say
they did one really important thing uh and it comes from the quote from the
video i asked you to watch i'm gonna read it out
you have to go into this dark chambers that we often shut off you gotta open
them up you gotta fight that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
demon you gotta get in there and talk that monster that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and say
what's up you all are about to hit a point where you're gonna have to kick open
that door and say what's up to that inner demon and so tonight

00:40
i'm spending some time trying to to mentally prepare you for that
right that idea that if you have the privilege to jump the gap
that you're going to hit the bottom and the only way through once you hit
that bottom is to get in there and say what's up
and so that's what we're preparing for tonight this idea i'm gonna go way back
here this idea that once you make the gap it's it really honestly is a click
it's a decision that you make right it's a it's a mindset it's a
mentality that my students have that go from here to getting jobs

00:41
right that go from here to getting a job so if you're able to bridge that gap
you have to commit to managing your frustration you have to commit
to finding your grit and letting no one get in your way
the biggest thing i like to tell people is don't let me get in your way i don't
want to ever hear you say leon you didn't teach this well you didn't cover
that in much detail [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me the the if the internet is infinite
right the internet is infinite you could
have found tutorials you could have done more don't even let me get in your way
of becoming successful when things don't make sense show your
grit get on discord leon i i posted on discord once nobody answered my question

00:42
all right try again try revisiting the question does it make sense right
does it make sense maybe i could ask the question in a different way
don't be the person that sits there and puts that on someone else
that puts it on me that puts it on the the different youtube people that
you listen to that like it's on you and it's a decision it's a mindset it's a
mentality are you going to do everything in your power to make it to the end
you owe you right dr eric thomas you owe you
all right are you going to do everything in your power to succeed
sometimes you gotta get a little wild with it
right you gotta unlock that inner body you gotta write some bad code you gotta

00:43
do some bad things right but you have to make that choice
i can see it i can always see it in my students eyes i can always see it i
mentioned this once before i could see it i would have students
that walked in the classroom they sat down they said what's up
and they weren't saying what's up to me they were saying what's up to that voice
in the back of their head they got in early they stayed late
when they didn't understand something they asked questions
they didn't take no for an answer so if you can make the gap
it's a decision that you make and i i i i have to say that because
some people don't have that privilege of making it across the gap but if you do
it is a decision that you make so make the decision second thing we

00:44
know we know that we have to be consistent we're trying to go from from zero
to employed in just 30 weeks with class just twice a night
sorry twice twice a week we're trying to go from zero to employed in 30 weeks
with just meeting for class twice a week that is a wild proposition
and so the only way that that works is if you're being consistent when you're
not in class are you finding time to study every day
do you have a schedule are you still waking up and going into class like an
accident we talked about this over and over again
right some of you right now are not doing anki every day

00:45
some of you are not doing yankee every day why are you here
i don't know how many times i've brought up thank you every day we got to be
consistent we know the science it's not even me you watch the videos you saw the
papers you know the science you know how our brains work
you know that active recall is how you cement ideas in the moment and space
repetition is how you cement them for the rest of your career
and if you're not doing it why are you here
leon isn't mad he's just disappointed no i'm not i'm excited i want all of y'all

00:46
to to realize that if you are here and that you have the privilege of time the
privilege of an internet connection the privilege of a computer to watch me on
the privilege of being able to take six nine hours to sit in a classroom and and
watch some person on the screen that that is an amazing opportunity
that i don't want you to waste and we know the things that work
right i told you give me a little bit of trust i think i've earned just a little
bit of trust i think you've been coming to class i think i did i think i did my
job a little bit okay i think i earned a little bit of it right i'm telling you
that this is what has helped thousands of people i've taught to learn how to
code i've taught hundreds of folks how to get jobs this is the way i've seen
work the best i think a lot of you have come from
other places you have tried other things and they have not worked

00:47
this is the process that we're talking about
even if you turn me off you never listen to me again
the people that do these things are going to be more successful at learning
how to code so if you can jump the gap if you're able to jump the gap
you're you're embarking on a process of managing your frustration and you're pro
embarking on a process of being consistent you will not make it through this
program without being consistent without putting in work every day
and that's why i say this might not be the time for you hey
thank you for the five get the subs demetrius what's going on
thank you i appreciate you being here right this might not be the time for you
you might not have that hour a day you might not have those three hours on

00:48
tuesday and thursday for class but i bet that if you're here
and you've been able to consistently show up right and you have that privilege
please don't squander it alright the last thing is taking care of yourself
a lot of people are already starting to get hurt fingers are starting to
to to to get sore right fingers are starting to get sore
wrists are starting to get tight forearms are starting to feel a little
little little little little twinges please take care
of yourself we got 25 more weeks right of hard work
you have class you have homework you have networking you have daily coding
challenges you have freelancing clients you have to get you have 100 hours

00:49
projects that you have to do it's going to be a lot
you have to take care of yourself if you want to make it through this process
submitting work uh originally we had some some work to submit today
i don't want to make it better i don't want to make it better um a lot
of folks got through the layouts already great make them better if you're done
everything make them better right this will always be your mandate
make it better right so i'm gonna assign more layouts
this week you're gonna have up until next week to finish them as you finish
them make them better do them with floats write bad code once you get done them

00:50
great go back try with flexbox oh right once that's done go back make it a
little bit better right know how much time you have
and know how much you can put into putting into this work right i'm not
asking you to to find magical time right i'm asking
you at the time that you do have that you're consistent with it
right you're consistent with it right we got a little bit of taste of networking
right this is this is where for a lot of folks the demon starts to wake up a
little bit right this is where this is where demons
start to wake up a little bit for some folks um they see this networking idea
this idea that we're gonna have to talk to real humans um but i can't tell you
how many messages i get i cannot tell you how

00:51
many messages i get in fact i got one in the ask leon channel i think i answered
it yet today or yesterday leon i applied to 500 jobs 500 i played the 500 i got
like nothing out of it no jobs no anything i did a boot camp
some other folks in my boot camp got offers why didn't i get offers i studied
these things i wrote this code i'm getting better at data structures and
algorithms i do all this stuff why am i not getting jobs is because it just
doesn't matter the network you build is the easiest way to open
doors and so when i say that there are some folks
alfas thank you for the hydration cheers to you when i say that

00:52
that scares a lot of people a lot of people go leon i thought this
would just be coding and i get a job no no
the networking is the thing that opens the doors for you and everyone
can find something that enables them to do networking in a comfortable way and
when i talked about pushing yourself managing frustration
networking is on that pile you can't just give up and say leo i'm
an introvert i don't like networking people scare me bye you can't do that
you have to invest in figuring out things they're gonna help you through
the networking there is a way for each person to network in a way that
works and feels comfortable for them and you are going to attempt

00:53
all those different ways until you find something that doesn't make you poop
your pants we're going to keep doing networking
nights we're going to keep giving you places to practice that
are with friends that are with the community we're going to keep doing it
but you have to find you have to make that
choice you have to make that click and say i don't want to be one of the people
that have applied to 500 places and nothing happens you have to build a network
you have to have people that are open doors for you that'll get your resume to
the top of the pile that will be your champions at companies that will be the
person that says i vouch for this person
so we're going to spend a lot of time on how to network we talked about just the
basics just the surface guess what we're
going to talk about it pretty much every class going forward
right so you're going to have to make that decision everyone has to make that

00:54
decision tonight is this going to be the thing that stops
you or you're going to carry some votes and logs and keep it moving
how do i explain a multi-year gap in your resume i said this before and
people got mad on twitter you are freelancing that is the answer that has
helped hundreds of my students get jobs with big gaps on their resume you're
freelancing i am not here to be the the perfect candidate i am not here to be um
the most the most scrupulous person ever on the face of this work on this earth
i'm here to get a job i honestly believe companies don't care about you if they
could fire you and pay someone cheaper they would i don't care about their
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] process i'm going to give you every hack to get in the door
up to you if you want to use those hacks

00:55
or not but you were freelancing you will you will get paid clients you will have
rehearsed and practice how to explain that gap in the lens of freelancing
and it works i've had folks that were literally incarcerated
returning citizens after five six years that got amazing jobs because they were
freelancing that's on you and you don't have to worry about those
things we're going to get to those things when we when we get further into
the in the into the cohort right like i feel like a lot of people have these
these pent up like excuses that things that like make you really afraid that
you're not gonna be able to get a job at the end i have seen folks come from all
walks of life shape size colors creeds it does not
matter it's a decision that you make right now it's a decision that's all it is
it's a decision do you want it or not that's all it is

00:56
it comes down it's a binary choice do you want it or not i i had you i had you
listen to that dr thomas video you owe you but the thing they said in that video
and i can't say it any better just like they say is that winners win
and losers lose i can't say it any better winners win and losers lose
are you a winner are you a loser and are you going to win by any means
necessary because that's what i'm about i'm going to win by any means necessary
these companies don't care about you if they could get you for cheaper they
would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them i'm going to get the bag and i'm going to do it
by any means necessary winners wins losers lose i you got to
pick right now do you want to be a winner you want to be a loser that's all
you it's that's all it is all right
because there's so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and the
reason why i'm this way the reason why i'm this way

00:57
is not because i i'm trying to be shady or tricky it's just that there's so much
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in between you getting the job and what
you actually do on the job and none of it none of it actually is a good
qualifier right none of it is a good qualifier there's a bunch of
odd gatekeepers and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that stands
in your way because by the end of this cohort you will have amazing skills you
will be wonderful software engineers you will have lots of value to provide to
these entry-level companies right and just because it's it's a thursday
and and the recruiter likes to talk backwards and wear hats and you showed
up in a hat and talk forwards your resume doesn't go to the next round
it just doesn't make any sense so i don't play into that game i play the numbers
right that's why we network in the 60 locations because 10 of those 10 of
those applications are going to be because you'd like the color purple and

00:58
and they hate purple it just doesn't matter it just doesn't matter winners win
losers lose make up your mind what do you want to be
you'll have the skills you'll be able to talk that talk and walk that walk but
there's so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the way that
you can't let that be what gets near what stops you daddy's win exactly
can you be a motivational speaker no i i don't i don't like giving these
motivational talks but i think it's something that you need to hear i think
it's something that's going to help you because it's about to get real dark and
scary out there folks and so i need you to make some decisions
tonight i need you to dig deep and figure out what you want
and i want you to realize that if you have a computer you have an internet
connection you have time you have an amazing privilege and you can make it to
the end but it's your decision and so i pop off like this specifically

00:59
in this class because next week we get the javascript and then we get to node
and then we get to actually interviewing and each one of those steps that demon
comes back and you have to be ready to kick open that door and say what's up
and so you're saying leon can you get to class this is class this
is what the whole class is going to be tonight and then we're going to end
we're going to you're going to work on your layouts and the reason i'm doing is
i think some of you need to hear it you might be right now saying this is a
waste of your time that's okay it's not for you
it's for that person that's hanging on by a thread
that really wants this at the end of the day but it's starting to let that demon
creep in that's who this is for if you're good i'm i'm glad come back on
tuesday we'll be back to regular programming
but there's too many folks that have to make that decision

01:00
tonight and this this is what this rant is for it's not for you it's for them
talked about this networking taking strangers and turning them into friends
that's all networking is folks i see so many folks kind of like
overthinking it and it's okay you gotta practice you gotta figure it out you
gotta try things that don't work that do work
right but at the end of the day it's just strangers into friends and
just treat it that way don't overthink the email just send the email don't
overthink the linkedin message just send it
you're going to get it wrong a lot but you're going to get it way way right so
many times and it's a numbers game right it's all it is so don't stress when
you're sending out those emails don't stress about the linkedin messages just
send them you'll get through it you'll get better
at it and you'll be able to you'll be able to see people's reactions right
maybe maybe they're like really weirded out by the message you sent that's okay

01:01
you learn not to send that kind of message you move on right
make sure your k your consistency is not
just the learning to code now right your consistency is like this whole process
that we're committing to right right it's the whole process that we're
committing to your consistency is also following up with people on emails
following people on linkedin following people on twitter right like that whole
process is part of your consistency now so i i keep bringing it up and i'm gonna
say it one more time please make sure you plan out your days
make sure you plan out your week don't go into your day like an accident make
sure you're doing your active recall your space repetition make sure you're
doing your follow-ups right that's all part of consistency
all part of consistency if we go over linkedin we're gonna have full classes
on it like i said we just start with the

01:02
tip of the tippy top of the iceberg when it comes to networking each class we're
gonna introduce more we'll introduce linkedin we'll introduce how to get
better at all these different places right but what you need to do is make
sure that you're ready to commit to a process right all right
we showed the stuff coffee chats make sure you're that's again part of your
consistency is keeping up this process of coffee chats and so that's why i need
to to to bring up this this class right you're you're going down this rapid
trough of sorrow right you're going down this rapid trough of sorrow
and you're you're you're starting to see
the bottom you're like leon oh hold on i
have homework i have class i have office hours i have space repetition i have
networking i have following up with my network connections i have following up
with my coffee chats i have daily coding challenges i have to learn new material

01:03
right i'm going to skip this for a second let me go here
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just got real all right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just got real
you're you're the the wearing off of novelty has happened
right you're starting to see the novelty wear off right shit's getting real
and you gotta make some decisions so i want you all to take a break
we're gonna take our normal five minutes when we come back we're going to talk a
little bit more about some of the bigger things that are coming up in the next
few weeks we're going to talk a little bit more
about mindset mentality we're going to review all the layouts together
we are going to then maybe end a little early so maybe like one break tonight

01:04
and then another hour and then i want you to have some class time
to to do something special um i want you to do something special
today so we're gonna give you a little bit of time to do it but let's go and
take our break and while we take the break please contemplate
are you going to make that switch tonight are you going to are you going
to make that claim that this is what you
want and you're going to let nothing get in your way
think about really if you're able to make across that gap
if you're ready to make it across that gap
and think about if this is what you want cool let's take a
in the break hey thank you for the raid 204 new folks coming through hope your

01:05
stream went well uh we were just about to take a break uh
but i'm glad you stopped by thank you for uh for the raid how'd your stream go
hope it went well thank you for coming on over raiders i uh
i i like our we we so we do a sunday office hours and that's kind of like the
only time that uh you are still streaming when i'm done so the next time
we see it we're sending you back because i love hanging out at your stream uh
it's one of my favorite channels to have up while i'm working i get i get a lot
of work done while you're up stream was great hope you went down we
hope you're doing well i am thanks for bringing everybody by
hope you all had a good good day but i'll i'll share again on discord folks
they're they're linked just because if you weren't there for that original raid

i'm always lurking and i love having it up while i'm working

01:06
so inspirational and another fantastic community so i'm going to make sure that
we actually have that link in discord so folks can always find it but um thanks
for bringing everybody by and hope you're doing well we're right at our
five minute break so it's sorry that we're i'm gonna walk away you're gonna
see bob come up for a few seconds but uh thanks for swinging by thank you
everybody that joined us with the raid and we like to be healthy so we take a
break at the top of every hour just to give our hands some some some relaxing
time if you're able please get up walk around stretch let your eyes focus on

01:09
something else and uh we'll be right back in five
we have to worry about ai stealing our jobs nah by the time that happens all
the other jobs are gone too and so much of programming is digesting like
business goals into code and i think ai's to really help with that
and it's actually going to speed up the process
do we ever learn django no we do full stack javascript here and use node
study groups people are at being added to the study groups like right now
our wonderful mod law has been hard at work adding folks uh and after stream

01:10
i'm gonna be adding folks too so it's just been a role adding party and
so you should some of you are already in them uh some folks already have access
to their study groups but um yeah give us like another day or two and we'll be
there yeah blah is amazing we go over how to price side jobs
absolutely yeah we're gonna have a full class on how to freelance and so yeah
we'll go over all that wonderful stuff can we learn stuff that translates over
to being a game developer some of this can be helpful like once you learn
language you can use it to bridge to other languages but i also recommend the
person that raided us they're amazing they build games
completely from scratch i would definitely hang out in their streams
their channels if that's what you're into and i'll share their their
twitch link after class as well juicebox hero hey

01:11
thank you for the five kids themselves hope you're doing well
do we need to do leak code questions we'll be doing a lot of coding
challenges together like a lot but i would say about half my students
wind up doing technical challenges the other half don't yeah
lux is the person to go to for the um for the game development
juice box how you doing thanks for swinging by
and different hey thank you for the fight get the subs
thank you you're trying to keep that top spot huh thank you so much
all right folks come on back come on back finally reading how to win friends and
influence people and loving it hey i'm glad to hear you you're getting

01:12
something out of it come on back folks all righty
a good coding platform for coding challenges for beginner we'll use code
wars to start before moving on to leak code all right
welcome back you got some amazing beard oils hey send me a mod mail
all right folks uh welcome back this is if you didn't realize this is a
leon rants stream uh where i try to motivate and let you know what you're
getting into for the next 25 weeks i i've hinted at what you're getting
into for the next couple weeks but i'm going to keep talking about it so
welcome global crisis hey thank you for if i get the subs i appreciate you all
tonight all these get the subs are wild thank you everybody

01:13
global crisis thank you for swinging by all right
what are code challenges good question uh so i i mentioned that we're gonna be
doing coding challenges uh so every day you're going to have a
challenge something that you have to solve with code um
they'll start off kind of simple and then they'll build up to being more
and more complex and they're just uh just a way of
keeping the things that you're learning sharp right to keep your your brain
thinking in good ways and to get practice the end goal is to have another
skill set which is like solving coding challenges because a lot of companies
still give you coding challenges to get a job so
instead of doing what a lot of people do which is they go through a full boot
camp and then they start doing coding challenges we start our coding

01:14
challenges in week week five of 25 uh next week
so by the end sorry of 30 uh so you you wind up having 25 weeks of coding
challenges uh and we do them every day every day
that ends with a y you'll be doing a coding challenge
and so by the end of program you will be a lean mean coding challenge solving
machine right that's the goal so don't worry about right now we'll
sign the first ones next week uh but that's i'm just trying i'm just trying
to paint a picture here for you i'll try to paint a picture here for you um
where we're turning it up i talked about it i
gave you the funny like uh simpsons gif we're turning it up uh you're doing all
this networking you're using the sheet right you're being consistent you're
using the sheet you're doing your daily coding challenges
uh you're getting a paid client yes folks that's right you're here to

01:15
get a paid client due march 29th is a paid client now you don't have to have
the work done by march 29th you just have to have the
signed contract for the work due march 29th
now if you're like what i have no idea what are you talking about getting a
paid client don't worry we're going to have full classes on how to freelance
how to get a paid client how to do it last cohort we had so many folks get
paid clients we're over 100k now in client earnings from last cohort right
and so the reason why i wake up in the morning
the reason i do what i do is because of this right here
the getting paid clients i've told you my story when i was hungry and i needed
food i needed money for food i got a client they paid a deposit i skipped my
ass all the way to the supermarket bought my pasta and pasta sauce and

01:16
lived a good life i want that for you right i want you to realize that the
skills that you already have have value i already have so many folks
that are coming to me leon i i posted on twitter i got a client right like
i want that for you i want you to have the ability to know that you have a
skill set that will put food on the table that you can use
to make money and that you can see the skills that you have right now have
value if you can do these layouts right if you can do these layouts
you can get a client that's all it is all right and so
we'll get into more about the client it is a paid client has to be 200 or more
can't be friends or family now some folks might have restrictions
they can't do paid work you're you're on unemployment or something like that i'm
not forcing you to do this for those that literally have like logistical

01:17
things that they can't do we'll have some other options but
everyone else i want you to push for this this is one of the best things you
can have on your resume right when you go to apply for a job and somebody says
you're calling yourself a software engineer has anyone ever paid you to be
a software engineer and you go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
i got tons of clients what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you
talking about go home close your eyes this is a wrap you cut
all right you're already software engineers
but now you're going to be paid software engineers
and somebody brought up a good point if you're in canada you're not a software
engineer so i was going to say that real quick you're in canada you're not a
software engineer you're a software developer canada has like restrictions
on who can call themselves engineers so i'm sorry you are software developers
everyone else your software engineers unless your country restricts the word
engineer in the us the only word that's restricted is professional engineer so

01:18
oddly enough never call yourself a professional engineer because that's
trademarked in the u.s at least but everyone else your software
engineers right now we're going to add paid to the front of that so
i'm revealing some of the onion here folks revealing some of the onion here
all right sergio holograms hey good to see you too
um thank you for the 10 months that's so wild we're revealing some of the level
of the onions here you're starting to see all the new work that's coming in
all the networking you're you're you're seeing the coding challenges come in
you're seeing the paid clients come in you're seeing the homework
get a little bit more intense all right the homework a little bit more intense
all right the homework we're pushing from today to next thursday
you have the three layouts that we did together right we've already done these
three layouts together i want you to get them

01:19
i want you to get all the layouts right so these three
then we have the the level ground that we covered the lower ground is a great
layout because it's very simple it's just boxes and text right i want you to
get the layout we have the source layout i want you to
get a layout i want you to get the the the core layout you see here on the
right but i also want you to get a res like a mobile version of that site as
well and i i want you to have that mobile site be triggered by a media query
right trigger it as a media query right and then i'm adding two more
two more okay we're good he's still here let's see how many people left

01:20
oh no people didn't leave you're still here hey i love it cool
added two more we have a lovely uh restaurant or cuisine layout
and then we have a wonderful hair salon layout
okay and then of course if you want to push there was the push layout as well
okay so you had the three that we've already
done together we did i think we did them during office hours you have the layout
that was supposed to be due today anyway right
and this one was supposed to be due today as well also by the way remember
these are these are layouts from dribble
dribble is a great place to see people's designs and and kind of more aesthetic
things in in development and so this is by max schneider a link to their work is
there uh this layout is by myth and ray link to their work is there same thing
mal khan link to the works there and then this one sergey of course link
to the work there right i went on dribble to find real layouts that real

01:21
people are using now the thing here is i want the layout that's what i want
i want the layouts only floats yes i think you should only you should try
doing this only with floats do that your first pass and if you want
to do a second pass in flexbox go back and do it right refactorings for closers
but don't let me stand in your way if you're if you if you really want to do
flexbox you don't want to listen to me that's okay go ahead and do it floats
are killer that's why i asked you to do them floats force you to learn the box
model they force you to learn that the the tricky hacky stupid stuff and i hate
using that word but like just really bad stuff that's built in the css right
whereas flex just kind of just works and you don't have to go through it so
i want you to layouts now how close these layouts to pixel perfect

01:22
is up to you and your maker okay i want the core layout for each i want
to be able to look at your layouts and go hmm that was definitely tech crunch
that was definitely khan academy it's definitely bbc
that was definitely level ground that was definitely source
that was definitely cuisine restaurant that was definitely the hair salon and
if you do the push oh okay i see that was the push right now how
close you get to pixel perfect is is not my call okay
it's up to you and the amount of time that you have right to put into this work
i want layouts and i want to be able to make sure that i that everything is part
of the layout some some tidbits of advice when you're doing this please
use ipsum like lorem ipsum for your placeholder text
try and use like real words when you're doing like your headings and things like
that hold back from putting like curse words
or weird stuff in in your text because you're going to forget about it you're

01:23
eventually going to put it on github and somebody's eventually going to see it
and they're going to see that you've
called every h2 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right every h2 is
always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right and so they're gonna
see it you're gonna forget about it someone's gonna be looking through your
code and they're gonna see it so try not to like i i used to be guilty of this
don't curse in your code don't put weird stuff in your code like you're gonna
forget about somebody's going to see it right i don't want that to be like the
reason why some some curmudgeon didn't give you an offer because oh people out
here cursing right cool you got all those layouts so hold on let's recap here
we got class we got reading we got videos to watch
we got networking to do we got active recall to do
we got daily coding challenges we got paid clients we got all these layouts
you also have to watch independence day you have to watch traversing media's js

01:24
crash course all this is due by next thursday and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just got real
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this guy real and when [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets real
you have to realize this is when you are the most vulnerable
i say it one more time once once you've gone down udemy hill and you have
gone past the the the you've gone past the wearing off of novelty
right the novelty has weared off right that is when you are the most

01:25
vulnerable this is where most folks start to look for the things that are
going to be lower cognitive effort they're going to look for the things that
give them the feel good win in the short term but don't help them in the long
term and so from the video that i had you watched before class
i really loved this quote you can't read someone else's book about
some siri on how to do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can't read somebody else's book about
some theory on how to do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one of the biggest things i see my
students do early on is they consume so much content about how to do it
right they consume so much content about
how to do it how to be successful how to
how to get to the end right and it feels good they buy that course the the 100
tricks to get a job they buy the other course like unlocking your brain like

01:26
it's just it's it's it's right now right it's right now right
when you're the most vulnerable when the
the the the new brand new smell has worn off
you've jumped over the gap and you've plummeted into the trough of sorrow
and in this moment i see a lot of students start to grab for things that are not
going to help them it's where a lot of folks make the
decision that this is not for them they're going to try something else
maybe something else will be a little bit easier maybe something have a little
less home or maybe something else and then what they do
is they constantly jump from thing to thing right they jump from thing to thing
they they start one course it doesn't work they jump to another course they
jump from one and then and then five years later

01:27
they're still thinking about wanting to be a software engineer
here's what i'll promise you you do this course you will have the skills to be a
software engineer that's a that's a that's a a big promise
but you'll have the skills that you need so if you need to go and jump from
something to something else just know when that doesn't work out you can come
back and get the skills you need here right but you owe you
to stick to something and i've given you the taste right
have you learned some html and css do you feel supported have you found a
community that's going to help you because if you did
if you felt like you've learned some stuff you feel like you found a
community that can help you stick with us for a little bit longer
give me another month right give me another month if i've earned
the next month from the first month and give me another month

01:28
because after two months i guarantee you will feel
as though you have finally kind of unlocked some real skills right
and then you'll be able to make a real decision
if my style is the way for you but what i would hate is for you at this moment
when [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just got real to be like nope
i'm done let me find something else that's easier because you will continue
to jump from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing and you won't get to the
promised land so if the first month went well give me one more
that's all i ask if you feel like you got some value out of the first give me
the second because i don't want you to keep jumping
and jumping and never find your way somebody gave me a stretch so i got to
stretch real quick hold on it's not that kind of stream folks you
want to see me stretch you know what you got to do a million channel points be

01:29
right back thank you fake adonis for the stretch
one day one day cool and so this quote i really love it you can't read somebody
else's book about some theory on how to
do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got to get in there and you got to do it
you got to get in there you got to do it stop reading content and how to do it
get in there do it stop reading the blogs on how to become a software engineer
put time into your layouts get get in the muck get in the mud get in the water

01:30
get dirty tell that demon in the back your brain what's up right do it
just do it winners win losers lose i can't say it any better cool now
there's one other thing in that video that was really important to me
and it's kind of something that we've been kind of hinting at throughout this
and they said it was kind of like in the background but they said
those that want to be a seal will be a seal
those that want to be a seal will be a seal and i've given you my caveat my
caveat to this idea is that not everyone has the privilege to jump through that
gap in the trough of sorrow and only you know if you have that
privilege or not there's no way i'll ever know but you'll know right and so
if you have the privilege to jump right if you have the privilege to jump

01:31
you have to make that decision do you want to be a software engineer
that's employed or not that's it it's all it is it's a decision
it's that that that thing that says in your brain that i'm not going to give up
i'm going to do what i have to do to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done that's it
talked about fighting those demons going into those dark places
and uh saying what's up and you're gonna have to do this over and over again
this these these fears these concerns were i just gave you a mountain of work
to get done guess what two weeks from now you're
gonna have another mountain guess what i'm not gonna have another mountain it's
gonna get harder there's gonna be more but you will get better at it
it's a decision and uh there's a couple other things from the

01:32
video i want to talk about this one has a strong disclaimer
they said we're weeding out the week to bring the strong together and i don't
like this i don't like the word weak here that's not what i'm thinking at
what we're doing here is we're weeding out folks
that don't want to seize the opportunity or folks that do want to seize the
opportunity that's what a boot camp does that's the dirty secret
that's the dirty secret don't use the word weak don't ever talk about yourself
that way right a boot camp weeds out the folks that
want to seize an opportunity and the folks that don't want to seize the
opportunity and you not wanting to seize the opportunity is okay
don't feel bad if life is not if this is not your moment that's okay give
yourself grace to realize right right give yourself the grace to realize
that this might not be your moment but there might be another moment in the

01:33
future so what a boot camp does is it weeds out folks that want to seize
opportunity from folks that don't i've already given you my disclaimer
about the gap right i've already given disclaimer
about the gab and so these next 25 weeks are about bringing together
the folks that want to seize the opportunity
that's what 100 devs is it's bringing folks together because in the video
they said i'd never saw someone carry a boat or a log by themselves i've never
seen it myself i've never ever seen one of my students learn and get a job
by themselves it's just not possible you could be the brightest most smartest
person on this earth you will need other
folks to learn how to code you will need stack overflow you will need

01:34
documentation you will need books you will need irc you will need discord you
will need community so 100 devs is about bringing together
folks that want to seize the opportunity
because i never saw someone how to learn how to code by themselves
and that's what we're focused on it's the community that's going to help you
in those deepest darkest moments of the trough of sorrow to get through it
and that's why this community is so important so who's going to carry the boats
and the logs who's going to come together seize an opportunity right
he's going to come together to seize an opportunity

01:35
to come together to pull each other through that trough of sorrow
put it in chat if you are i've seen a lot of yeses
a lot we got this see a lot of bets i'll try come on now you gotta you gotta
you gotta you gotta invoke the uh almighty yoda do or do not there is no try
yes all right i'm gonna hold you to it i'm printing out i'm printing out this
this chat log today folks printing out this chat log today folks
gonna pin it on my wall and then i was looking for navy steel
gifts and this came up so i was gonna show you this gift cause i thought it

01:36
was pretty cool all right let's do some quick review quick review
let's walk through our layouts and i want to end with something special
you all said that you want to carry some votes and loss we're going to hold you
to it and we're going to do something special on discord let's do our review
let's look at these layouts together let's make sure folks have a good idea
what they're getting into with the layouts and then we're gonna
do something on discord and we're gonna end early
that way you can have some class time to get started cool
all right golden rule separation concerns let's do this this is what we
do folks this is what we do we carry the
boats in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] log this is what we do
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is separation of concerns why is it the golden rule
why is it the golden rule because of organization let's go

01:37
progressive enhancement we talked about this idea that
as we're building out these layouts right as we're building out these layouts
the core of the layouts is going to be good html you got to have good html when
you're worrying about these layouts right the core is the html
the presentation that css that we wrap around that comes second and it
shouldn't be a lot right the core is the peanut the chocolate will get us there
then we have a thin candy coating that is javascript that we're going to start
learning on thursday thursday thursday we learned javascript
folks can you believe it we're there already all right where did css go folks
is it going in line is it go in the head does it go in a separate file
goes in a separate file of course inline if you're writing html

01:38
emails in the head if you work at amazon you have critical path css otherwise in
a separate file so we can hear that separation of concerns we know this
whole thing is a rule a rule is broken down into a selector a declaration block
a declaration and properties and values now see this review that we're doing now
should be really reviewed because you've been doing anki every day and all this
stuff is already in your anki right right all right cool
we have rules that can be overwritten by rules that come below
and the reason why we're able to overwrite rules that come above is due

01:39
to the what due to the what the cascade bbtown i see your pokemon card i'm going
to get to you i see your pokemon card when we take a break i'll get to you
all right parent child selectors remember we have
parent child selectors and we have direct parent child selectors when you
see the right carrot we got a direct which means that the paragraph has to be
directly inside the section lovely we're you're all cruising through this stuff
remember when this is the first time you heard this stuff and now you're just
cruising look at y'all we got parent child right parent child
no carrot means that it could be a child anywhere inside right so this paragraph
is inside of a section but it's not directly it's directly inside of the article
so that still works we have sibling selectors and so this is
a direct sibling meaning that we have to have a paragraph that comes before the
other paragraph so this is the only paragraph that would become red because
the only one that has a paragraph immediately before it this paragraph

01:40
does not have another one above it boom all right ids and classes ids are how we
target one element only one element ids are unique we can give an element an id
and then it can't have another id and that id cannot be shared with other
elements it's a way of targeting one thing and only one thing when it comes
to our css classes are a little different each
element can have as many classes as they want really and those classes can be
reused across elements so if we give bob a bunch of elements all of them will be
colored red beautiful specificity how many points of
specificity does this rule have seen it before how many points
yes sir we got one two points for tags we get one for a class and one

01:41
for an id 112. let's do this one real quick we got one tag for one point
one two three classes and one id 131 nice cruising let's look at this we got
one two three tags we got oops sorry no not tags one two three classes zero tags
one id for the diet coke and an important so we get the 1130. nice let's go
box model what makes up the box model in terms of width
what makes it the box model in terms of width box well in terms of width yeah
the actual width of the element it's padding on both sides and then it's
border on both sides same thing for the height right we get the height of the

01:42
element it's padding on the top the padding on the bottom it's border on the
top the border on the bottom nice cool remember margin is the bully that
pushes the box model around all right we did our layout so far with
floats we'll see some flex on tuesday um our floats remember they're fighting to
get to go up as much as they can to the left as much as they can go up to the
right as much as they can go and to the and up that's so weird i should say that
again if you're fully something left is going to go up as much as you can go
into the left as much as you can go you're floating to the right and go up
as much as you can go and to the right as much you can go it's always fighting
to get into that corner alrighty let's talk about how to approach these layouts
so we have a lot of layouts that are being done for homework

01:43
let's talk through each one and then we're going to end a little
early with something special cool warning we're all baddies
and we're writing bad code please you have all these layouts to get done by
thursday i need you to push yourself to get through these layouts please
put in the time and effort if you have it to get this stuff done it's really
important that you work through these layouts right
and it's really important that you embrace your inner baddy
write bad code don't get stuck on one thing right move on you got so many
layouts if you get stuck on one layout move to the next i guarantee you will
have learned something that you can put to use in another one
right so be a baddie write bad code cork like tina if you need to all right

01:44
we uh we've already done these first three layouts together so i'm going to
skip those i'm going to go right to layout 4.
when i look at layout 4 i see a couple big things
actually let me see if i can just open these layouts one second
the timer always gets in the way all right so we got all the new layout
photos so if you want the the actual photos
you don't have to use the slides i've given you the photos for each one
um so let's go ahead and take a look at level ground
there you go that makes me a little mean a little bit bigger
beautiful i look at level ground i see yeah you're not coding along we're
just talking through this i want you to have this in case you need to to come
back right because you need to come back and look at this when i look at this

01:45
i see but i have some sort of top section um some people would would maybe
make this like a main some people might throw it all in a header but
for me this is probably a main i probably have a header that could be
uh up here if i wanted it to with css and then i have my navigational
components in here too so header nav right
and then inside the nav i still have my ulis maybe
if i don't think that's a list of stuff that could just be anchor tags and then
my donate button is just an anchor tag and this logo could be a logo
when you're doing these layouts you can just use placeholders you can use
icon fonts like font awesome whatever's going to make it easier for you snipping
and clipping exactly you could just do screenshots don't don't put too much
time into getting the right logos and everything get your layouts done and

01:46
then come on back right definitely an h1 a paragraph
maybe like a span and definitely a span here
we got like a nice easy section with like an h2 and a paragraph
then like another lovely section and then inside this section i probably
actually have two sections and then each of those sections has an image
like an h3 a paragraph and then like an anchor tag
right and remember this is just my quick pass through
right my quick pass through you you can make different decisions for this stuff
right go fast be a baddie break things i didn't want to go that big

01:47
all right let's look down here once again another section
pretty easy i love this layout because it is so easy um
h3 or 4 paragraph anchor tag right and then this is this is where
this is where people get caught up this is where people got scared
right so people start losing themselves right where people start to lose
themselves you know what you know what be a baddie skip it next one right to
move on to the next one right skip it come back to it later once you've had
more practice come back do the hard thing next all right who cares
you're a baddie you write bad code you skip things come on now let's see we had

01:48
[Music] we go in order we had the source as well first first try [Laughter]
exactly do you all hear the sound alerts i'm not hearing them interesting
and we bad as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right you did hear him cool um
but for real i can talk through it if you want to talk through but i i wanted
the the emphasis to be on don't get hung up on things that are getting you hung
up move on you got plenty of time to come back and and do things
but if i'm looking at this this is definitely a footer to me
and then what i've seen i've actually given this to other developers to work
on um some of them have done lists they've done lists for each of these so
like ul with three lis inside of it or three lies with um
font icon fonts like font awesome in it or just anchor tags or just screenshots
whatever you want to do but yeah just a like a list like a list of icons

01:49
and then these were also lists uh with just two lis in them
right just list with two lis in them and these could either be like these are
like really small headings right because they are headings they describe what
comes after like h6 h6h6 right pick your poison it's up to you you
could do it right screenshot the whole bottom section got it exactly is he
and then over here uh this is just like a heading and then like a paragraph
and then um this right here you use an hr you band you cut
uh and then down here just like another like paragraph right
you could do border bottom border border top whatever whatever suits your fancy
there cool and then all that's just inside of
a footer so not too scary how how you how you um decide to

01:50
get everything to sit next to it is is the hard thing there
simply just floating your lies will get you this uh that that kind of
layout and just make sure they have width and then this little logo down here
could just be a screenshot that you plop in there um yeah
you make it sound so easy leon uh i mean it's not it's not easy right but it's
like it's trying to talk you through some of the things that i would think
about as i'm working on a layout like this
right and the idea here is i don't get i'm not i'm not serious about it i'm
having fun with it the sooner you can have more fun with this stuff the easier
your life's going to be so have fun with it be a baddie write bad code if
something's giving you like like a like indigestion skip it right just skip it
right skip it come back later you pick up so much stuff from each layout that

01:51
by the time you come back to it you've learned so many more things right
look at this other one here source um source for me
pretty easy we have a header up here we have a header up here a lot of folks
get tripped up on this there are ways to have like your header
inside of a main right but i think what people see this is they they lose they
lose their they lose their minds this this is where this is where people get
really tripped up you see this and you're trying to
you're trying to say all right well how do i get this mane to be behind that
that header right that's the wrong question because you are
thinking in terms of css and not in terms of your html just make this a header

01:52
make this a section and give them the same background color that's it move on
right bingo bango exactly right easy don't don't do things that that
don't don't don't you don't have to push be a baddie write bad code
all right same thing here this could just be a header right header
and then like your your main right header and your main
and then in the header you have a very clear nav to me uh definitely with like
your ul li anchor tags uh maybe like another loose anchor tag over here and
it's like a little image or logo there you can just use some text yeah
uh in the main we got i probably i probably split this up into like two
sections here uh this section just would have the image all right

01:53
just be the would be the uh the the image and then we got like a span
a heading probably like your h1 a simple form and then like another paragraph
right and then down here it's very similar to what you did with the bbc
it's just four sections each with some sort of like
image or icon from a font awesome or something like that maybe like a heading
like an h3 or h2 paragraph span and it's the same for each of them like the icon
the heading the paragraph the span and then just down here one other section
heading paragraph that's good and then we have like this lovely mobile layout
which is pretty much the same stuff but we get it to stack
um we get it to stack how do we get it to stack how can we get this to stack

01:54
yeah you just have a media query and you set everything to like 100 width right
if you have a media query you set it all
to 100 width it'll just stack by default right so use the media query set it to
100 width and boom it'll stack and probably look pretty close yeah
people are saying what's font awesome font awesome is an icon font um so it's
just it's a font that's made up of different icons like logos and things
like that uh it's it's free you can use it for your projects i use
it a lot just for quick logos and things like that occ just put the link in chat
yeah fontawesome.com what about getting the menu to stack um
very there are lots of ways you could do it but really simple would be
when you're in the media query you can just display none this stuff right

01:55
and display block the li that has the hamburger in it right
so you can basically just like hide all this stuff and show this thing
there are a lot of other ways to do it because like if you if you if you like
for if some people by accident will like hide the hold header
if you hide the header and this thing is
inside the header you still can't see it so the trick is to like hide this stuff
individually and show the hamburger and you can do that with uh with a media
query yeah the floating window is how it looks on the mobile but once again
if you get everything else and you're hung up on how to get this
this hamburger to work what do you do you get hung up you don't know how to
make the hamburger work what do you do move on exactly next next skip it skip it
you ever try to skip it i'm a beast that skip it

01:56
my raw athleticism just makes me a beast that skip it i don't know
why but it's true let's go to the next one cuisine all right this one um
ignore all this stuff here that's just kind of like the design right that's not
part of it what we're looking at is the layout here
i'm more of a bop it person i'm i'm a beast at anything so
bop it always frustrated me but simon says i can get 25 deep easy easy on simon
says we'll do it live maybe one day on stream but like simon says there's
something in my brain that works what simon says like where you have to hit
the lights and you got to keep doing it in the

01:57
order because my brain works well i don't know why 25 are only fans let's do it
somebody has to say somebody has to bet me i don't want
to bet somebody else is only advanced though all right this layout let's see
uh once again we got navigational content at the top ulis anchor tags all right
we got our lovely h1 a form and maybe like a list with these social
stuff and this image people get confused on this that's that's not an image it's
a background image so like this beautiful like fruit and stuff and like
this coloring behind everything it's not actually an image you can have
background images in your css and so it's kind of confusing because

01:58
some images are content and other images are style right
i could very clearly just make this background like blue
and obviously the color blue is not content right i'm styling this
background to be blue so it's the same thing here like this image is not
content the image should not be in your html it is the background in your css
right i see a lot of people saying she hal exactly it's in shae hao boom
i love that so here's the thing there's just no no
there's no amount of time where we could cover everything in class right and so
there are those lovely nuggets in the reading and that's why we assign the
reading and all the videos right you gotta you gotta absorb stuff from other
mediums to help you out when you get into these types of things like these
layouts all right next we have like our regular section here

01:59
uh seems like a span for the about us i could also maybe see an argument for
like some sort of header there but i think this is the header i would say
that's probably like our h2 paragraph paragraph anchor tag and then
down here is like another section fan h3 a list of like pieces of text so
they do look you propose to click on them to change it so i say um
ulli anchor tags for each of those and then just four images right
and so what i hope you're seeing is that these layouts they seem wild at first
and yes there are a lot of details but the core
of each layout is pretty much exactly the same right we're doing the same
10 tags over and over again right it's the same tags over and over
again it's just different push it to the right this time push it

02:00
to the left this time right we need that no we don't you don't need
to add this stuff here this is just like you don't have to add any of sorry
you have to add any of this stuff no don't worry about that
it's not part of the site cool same thing up here we've seen this
already just i think that's the continuation of this section yeah so
this right here is just this section here you don't have to like do another one
uh and then this is just the page continuing right page continuing
another section a span a heading um and then probably just some text here
right this look this is like a icon that's centered or an image of centered

02:01
fan that centered another span that's probably centered um
this can maybe be like two sections here just to be sure with like an h4 or h45
and then a span same thing like h4 or five and then a span and then
this looks like a video but you can just put an image here for now
and then down here finally like our last section
there's like a span and then some sort of heading maybe like an h45 uh image
uh i don't think that's a heading so maybe like a span ban image paragraph
and call it a day but all these things could
are we doing these also exactly yes you have two new ones that you have to do
uh we're gonna talk about svg you should cover some svgs in the reading right
right are we gonna do more flexbox before we
move the js yeah we're gonna do a little bit on tuesday

02:02
yeah we'll do a little bit on tuesday a little bit because we want to learn
javascript and then come back and be able to add it
we want to be able to we want to be able to build big things and when we come
back and can build big things like coming back and being able to to
actually have a hamburger menu that you can click on
right and then having all this be flex right is way more important than burning
out on flexbox right now before we can actually do good stuff with it right so
we're going to spend time learning javascript then come back so that we can
build like real layouts that do stuff and have interaction and behavior and
that's when flex becomes really helpful um all right
thought one two five you gave me a stretch but you also gave me a stretch
during the break so double dipped i guess let's go and take our break uh we have
just the push layout that's left i believe to go over which we'll take a peek at

02:03
and then when we come back from the break i got maybe just a few more
minutes i want to share with you some some big things uh and then i want to do
something fun on discord and we'll call it for this evening
we also have the pokemon card so when we come back we'll do the pokemon card
we'll do the raffle for the first 100 t-shirt uh of the cohort and we'll look
at one more layout and then we'll call it so
uh maybe yeah maybe we'll do a quick raid
all right so let's go ahead and put five minutes on the timer here alrighty
you're able please get up move around stretch let
your eyes [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] something that's not your screen

02:07
we're in this for the long haul folks 25 more weeks let's get it in five

02:08
can we go over the salon layout too yeah we'll do that sure over like
uh bengals yeah i think i decided that earlier
princess sparkle bottom i'll tell them i said goodnight goodnight
why do you not like button tags because they're messy i like i just use anchor
tags is it okay to use display inline block to display a list horizontally
absolutely yeah absolutely you put your hair spray put hairspray my
hair no never if you're locked out of discord um send uh send a
well first make sure you're not banned send a unbanned request just to make sure
but you shouldn't be locked out of discord for any reason unless you're banned

02:09
go ahead indifferent nerd out on me did you find a new hair care product no
not yet a lot of people sent me really good recommendations though i just got to
take some time to try a bunch of them what's your favorite band 5 iron frenzy
all right there sorry we got to do the the hair
salon folks want let me pull that up all right hair salon here we go beautiful

02:10
all right folks welcome back welcome back yeah i mean growing up for me it was
very much like hardcore rap and grime punk music and ska like that that that's
that was my range that's all i listened to i think they're not that far away as
most people would think all right cool so this is the uh the hair care layout
and i think the tricky one about this is
that like there is this like image thing but remember this this this image
would be all a background image so you don't have to worry about like this
curve thing that's all part of the image that's not actually um
it's not actually like part of the html right so if i'm looking at this i have

02:11
my header and then i have my main right and that main
just has like a background image that happens to look wonky with like that
that that skewing and stuff like that that's not um that's not something you
have to worry about in terms of css and then we have our header
right we have our sorry our heading our h1 blonde and highlight we got maybe
like a paragraph anchor tagger button and this is just like another section
uh that's in there with some text maybe a span maybe a paragraph
uh maybe this like 20 is a span that you can make differently like size it
differently and then uh another button or anchor tag and then over here
to two anchor tags cool so i think that's pretty this one's
pretty easy and then the nav2 is pretty straightforward just like our normal

02:12
nav ul li anchor tags these words on the side actually see that
um that's probably just like a span you can actually do transforming with css
we're gonna do a class on like css animations and stuff later on cause i
just really like i really like that stuff but you can actually like skew and
rotate and all that fun stuff and transform uh with css so you could like
have it typed out regularly and then like flip it if you want it to
uh once we learn javascript we'll do the class on like css tricks and css
animations because i want you to like click and trigger animations that are
all done in css and so yeah we'll come back to that stuff in the future because
i think it's fun then down here we just have like a
normal section almost exactly like the bbc where you have three sections inside
image heading paragraph for all three of them probably like an h3 in there
and then down here another section same thing

02:13
you have like a heading you look at h3 or four a paragraph anchor tag a button
image right and then if we look on this other side
it's just continuing the same layout once again just section
one two three sections inside of it um it looks like these could be
uh images and then maybe i actually think it's probably probably
this whole thing is an image um there is text so it shouldn't be though right um
yeah this would probably be like a section there's three sections right
three sections probably inside of a section and the
section has an image and then maybe there's i'm being a baddie right be a
baddie tell me to be a baddie be a baddie let's say a div a div with uh
maybe a heading because it's their name and then a spin all right

02:14
i felt i felt bad i felt good your body write bad code right don't get
hung up on it right don't get hung up on it cool next one section
same thing it's like this whole image is just a background that will be in the
css and so this is probably like a span um maybe like a paragraph maybe a span
to target that one differently anchor tag or button
and then the other thing here is that there are like
things that are grabbing your attention so you might maybe think about m or
strong tag somewhere in here and then lookbook is pretty
clean as well heading maybe like your h5 or six and then all these are just
images and eventually once we get to javascript
there are there are lots of like off the self javascript that makes doing this
thing easy so like in your html it would
just be your 20 images and then we would have some css and javascript that would
um do the grid the old school one is called masonry uh we used to do that

02:15
back in the day like masonry would like would help you do the tiling but now
it's built into a lot of like ui systems as well
yeah this is this is this is just one website this is like the top half of it
this is the bottom half of it so it's still the same site
do we use flow to this page yeah i think you you should do your first pass with
floats just to learn how to use them you want to do a second pass on flex or if
you get stuck you need to use flex that's okay
cool i think that's all the layouts that we had for homework
we had uh the original three layouts that you had to get done
the level ground uh the source which we covered the cuisine which we covered and
the highlight which we covered so you have a lot of layouts to get to

02:16
i'll let you else you could get to right but uh put in it put it in the work
all right if you want to push i gave you a push
layout uh the push layout i'm not going to go over because it should be a push
right uh leon is it just layouts not the exact
images and such i want you to get close right at first write bad code just get
the layouts done but the closer you can get your layouts looking presentable the
better you can do and like i said i want the core layout how close you get the
pixel perfect is between you and your maker right um that's up to you to
figure out how close you want you want to take the pixel perfect some folks are
going to have more privilege of privilege of time so they'll they'll go
super deep um but yeah put your time into these layouts i wouldn't put your
time into anything else besides these layouts in the videos that you have to
watch remember on top of all these layouts by
next thursday you must have also watched independence day
and uh the the goat of all goats traversing media has a wonderful js

02:17
crash course just get through it i just want you to be introduced to a
lot of the material that we'll be covering in class in way more detail okay
all right we talked about making our sites
responsive uh meaning that we don't have them just set to a fixed width meaning
that they respond to the different viewports or size of the screen it looks
good across devices remember when you're making a responsive website you want to
be fluent your things are size and percentages are using flex so that as
you kind of shrink and grow the screen it responds fluidly elastic meaning that
we're using fonts and other bits of text and m's and rems and then you're also
making good content decisions when do you decide to show that mobile
layout based on the viewport size cool all right you're using media queries to
make your content decisions and for those last

02:18
layout five six and seven i would want you to have at least one media query
right at least one media query where you're setting like the mobile layout as
opposed to just having a regular kind of full width layout
so if we look at the the past layouts push i would want you to make it mobile
responsive layout 7 make it mobile responsive layout 6 make it mobile
responsive and layout 5 make it mobile responsive so 5 6 7 and push i want at
least one media query at least one media query and a site that looks decent on
mobile where can i find these wireframes they are in the follow along materials
channel on discord all of our material will always be on on um on discord
the traversing media course costs money no no you're not doing the course you're

02:19
just watching the video the video is completely free online on youtube
can you get the background images you can you can you can right click and
download them or you can just take screenshots to grab all the images but
don't don't pressure yourself to get perfect images
you can use anything placeholders there's a bunch of placeholder websites um
i can find one here yeah here you go so this is place kitten
uh this is place kitten a little bigger here
so what you do as so instead of like having to download an image
you can just do placekitten.com 200 by 300 and what that'll do is it'll give
you a 200 by 300 image so whatever whatever size you put in there that's

02:20
the size of the image that it gives you so you can just use place kittens
everywhere if you want it to there's also one called place hold it
that does the same thing but they're just like gray boxes
so if you just want to be like quick and like go through
your layouts with just placeholder images this is what you can use cool
went through responsiveness about content decisions and then the uh
the last little bit because we're going to end early tonight
we'll do our raid just because people need the channel points right we need
the channel points but the idea here is that i hope you dig deep
i hope with all this work you fight the suck
and you start to carry the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] locks okay uh i believe in you

02:21
i think if you put in this work and you have the privilege of being able to jump
over the gap you can honestly really do this
and as always you don't have to listen to just me
right go look in the celebrations channel looked at all the pinned
comments look at all the pinned jobs right you can do this
i don't care who you are where you come from what you do
you have a decision to make if you have the approach of jumping across that gap
you're gonna put in the work over the next 25 weeks to dig deep fight the suck
and carry the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] logs because if you do
you have an amazing community behind you
that wants to see you succeed that wants
to see you win and you know that you can do this
you have to fight those demons in the back of your brain all the time
but you can do this all right i want to do a raffle and then
we'll do a raid uh this raffle is for the first uh the first t-shirt of the

02:22
cohort one second to cue it up here so i'll tell you when it opens in a second
alrighty all right they don't make it easy to just have them cued up alrighty
so the raffle should now be open you can do exclamation point raffle in chat
this is for the first 100 devs t-shirt of the cohort it's a lovely black t-shirt

02:23

um let's do the pokemon card real quick and then i want to do one thing before
we do the raid so i want to do the pokemon card and then do one more thing
before the raid uh so let's go ahead and just open up an inspector here and

02:25
let's go to the console there we go math.seal
times 64. so what this is going to do is going to give us a number between 1 and
64. uh that coordinates with the pokemon card list alright so
here is the pokemon cards list that we'll have up let's go ahead and do the math
three two one fifty-nine all right so bb tone 59 you got
an ambipom coming your way amy palm g uh that was a good card back in the day

02:26
i wanted to do before we do the raid we're going to do the raid we're going
to send some love and positivity all right but then
we have a little bit of time about half an hour half an hour extra
once you get on discord i just want you to put somewhere
that you're gonna carry the boats and the logs because to me
carrying the boats and the logs is not a singular endeavor
right so somewhere i don't care if it's general i don't care if it's in hamilton
i don't care where it is on discord maybe your study community if you've
gotten added to one yet we're working on it tonight and tomorrow all right shout
out below thank you so much right i want you to go somewhere on discord
and say that you're going to carry the bullets unlocked i want to see an
overwhelming amount of people commit to carrying the boats in the logs because
when you commit to carrying the boats and the logs it's not just about you
it's about all the other folks that you're going to help carry that boat in

02:27
the locks because nobody carries boats and logs by themselves
so somewhere we're gonna we're gonna blow up discord somewhere
put it just so that i i have the i have the proof
three weeks four weeks a month two months from now that you said you're
going to help carry the boats and logs i can just control search for it and i'm
going to see that you said you're going to carry the boats unless i want you to
do that tonight we're going to do a race and get the
channel points um but then you got a half an hour put in discord somewhere
please and then please work on the layout we're going to go over to rav we're
going to say what's up the wrap give them a follow even give them a follow
say hello spread some love but then take some time to start and
allow you got an extra half an hour use it right make the decision use the

02:28
half an hour to start a layout all right let's go ahead and start the raid
hope you all had a good night i know it's a little bit different of a stream
