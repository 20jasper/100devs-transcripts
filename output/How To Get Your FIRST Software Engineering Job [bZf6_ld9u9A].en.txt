00:00
spread out throughout our time together
has been little things that help you get a job
so what I have done is combined all of those Snippets into one class so I don't
care if you are on class one ketchup crew I don't care if you're deep in the
hunt or if you're already on the job this class is for you
now we're going to cover a lot of stuff we're going to cover everything from
your online presence to how to interview all the way through data structures and
algorithms just to get that refresher and we didn't get a lot of space
repetition in yet right and so we're gonna pull it all together in one class
and my goal is that as you are going throughout the hunt this is the class

00:01
you come back to when you need to remember you're a
wonderful time in the hollowed Halls of 100 devs this is the class you come back
to when somebody says Hey Leon or hey your name I've been trying to get a job
for a long time I haven't been able to do it this is the class you show them
all right so that's the goal uh we're gonna walk through kind of all these
little bits Bob's doohickeys bring it all together
and then you are ready to go along the hunt now this isn't this isn't the end
folks this isn't the end uh as you know tomorrow we have our tea spill six
o'clock on Discord these t-spills have been wild folks absolutely wild the
information gets shared in these real boots on the ground experience of what
it's like to get a job coming out of the hundred devs experience

00:02
what it's like to get a job right now right then all day next week not just
Tuesday when we have class but Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday you
have stand up right come on over to stand up we got
500 plus people sometimes peaking over 600 people walking through a coding
challenge each day learning progressively harder and harder
methods than harder and harder data structures and algorithms
answering real questions of what folks are running to and running into on the
hunt so this isn't it this isn't the end this is a beautiful new beginning
all right so let's get into it I want to go back
I want to start at the beginning I want to bring in all the things that I think
are going to make you successful on the hunt if you're new around here you got
referred from a friend what an amazing friend they are I'm Leon we're running a

00:03
free software engineering boot camp for folks that are trying to go from zero to
employed right and we've been doing this for months so we are condensing all of
that knowledge into one class but there are definitely
areas where we go into more detail and previous classes on YouTube where you
can go back and watch those classes so if you feel like we go a little too fast
through something that you really want to dive into a little bit more you can
definitely check out those previous videos on YouTube and I really think
it's important no matter what stage you're at that you really take this
stuff to heart and that you keep it up to date
it's wild on these streets folks and I'm a realist
I always tell my students yes you got the job but the first three months are
the most important of that job and maybe even of your career those first three

00:04
months are hard those first three months don't always work out
so while you're getting paid to learn how to code keep all this stuff up to date
right we're seeing some layoffs come around come around right if you're at a
company that did layoffs and you're the first person in the door well guess what
you're the first person out never exactly never stop looking for a
job always keep this stuff primed always
make sure this stuff right it's the FIFA data structure
oh you didn't do them like that that would be that's a fire tweet right there
somebody tweet that I'll I'll retweet it [Music] um
and so I think it's important to keep that in mind whether you're you're just
starting the hunt and you need this stuff for your current process whether
you're on class 11 of the ketchup crew this is something you should start
working on now anyway and if you're on the job make sure all this stuff is
buttoned up I know it's a lot I know you're learning a lot I know you're

00:05
putting in a lot of work but you got to stay on top of this stuff to all right
we're going to discuss are you ready come to the boardroom
you're ready you're ready to interview no matter
how prepared you think you are if you've been keeping up with pace of class you
are ready easy dunk we're going to talk about how to get an
interview how to do all the little things to to make sure that you're
attractive to interviewers to all the things you need to do to kind of get
past that first round to pass the sniff test right and then how you can
get past the further rounds like the technical challenges and things like
that so lots to cover we're going to go through it uh at a fast clip at this

00:06
point in program it is the hardest for a lot of folks
there is a mental block that happens where they legitimately don't want to start
the hunt let me get bigger I'm gonna go there's
a moment exactly where imposter syndrome
hits you doubt all the work that you put in and you talk to yourself and say
maybe I'm not ready you are ready now are things gonna go perfect out the gate
absolutely not you have 60 companies that you have to network your way into
and people are gonna ghost you interviews are gonna go poorly things

00:07
are not gonna go your way but that is oh okay you are ready
you have amazing projects you have skills that no one can take from you you
have put in the work to start the hunt so please please start the hunt
this is your sign right this is your sign this is your sign please start [Music]
you that has not started this is your chance to start I'm asking you start
because once you start you start to realize

00:08
that it's not as bad as you thought it might be one of the things that so many
folks have said right so many folks have said on Discord
especially during the tea spills is that I thought these interviews were
going to be one thing and they were completely different than what they had
built up in their head right you will be surprised about how some of your
interviews go where it feels like you're talking to a friend where everything
kind of Vibes it just works out right get to that point where you get to those
interviews where you feel the weight come off your shoulders because you are
ready now the Hunt is a hunt you don't go out
and get your kill every single time you go out to hunt you have to be ready for
it to take a while you have to be ready for it to be something that can take you

00:09
to your breaking point I loved Jeff's story from the T spill on Friday Jeff
time and time again had to take breaks but just didn't give up and found a
phenomenal job that fits them perfectly all because
they decided to not give up and that's easier said than done
but that's the only thing that's standing between you and a job
is you deciding to either not start the hunt or to not complete it because the
hunt does not stop until you get a job hundreds of folks with the same skill
set and experiences as you have gone out and gotten a job you can do this you
have a whole Community behind you that will support you in doing this you are

00:10
ready just had a CTO of a major Canadian tech
company respond to me on LinkedIn with a meeting date don't be afraid to reach
out once you start doing it magic starts to happen the more you start to open
these doors the more opportunity that can come and knock him that's it folks
that's it so tonight I'm gonna help you button up everything that you need to
open all those doors to start the hunt to continue the hunt or to refresh your
hunt so you can actually get the job but before we get into that you are ready
start all right now how do we not run into this situation

00:11
where uh they they they had 400 plus applications uh with no luck right
they had 400 plus applications with no luck uh it's because they were a dirty
dirty Clicker right they they just clicked apply never ever click apply
just doesn't work now can you can you get lucky yeah you can get lucky and
when I say never ever click apply what what I really mean is you network your
ass off you try every Avenue to get into that company to talk to a real living
breathing human being to get your work in front of people that can actually see
it if you've given it the good old 100 devish try you've really networked you
know in your heart of hearts you've done everything to get in front of a real

00:12
human being and for some reason it's not working out then you click apply
but if you just click apply on 400 plus applications don't be surprised when
nothing happens applying is your last resort exactly all
right so what do you need before you start kind of networking your way and
start applying uh you need the checklist and so you can do exclamation point
checklist here in chat or you can click the link that's in the slides uh
remember this originally came from Stephanie who came for two Mondays they
helped us build out our template replies list you can do expiration Point
templates if you need those templates so thank you Stephanie for helping us put
this together it's everything that you need to pass the initial sniff test right
you're about you your portfolio your resume your GitHub your Twitter your

00:13
LinkedIn your Angelus your cover letter your cover email it's all here
with check boxes so you can follow along with examples that you can follow and
it's everything that you need to be ready for the hunt now
uh I have a slide later on one of our folks that went on to get a
job when they were doing their coffee chats one of the coffee Chatters said
I've had dozens of folks apply that did not have this stuff
right they legitimately didn't have their GitHub set up they didn't have
their Twitter set up they didn't have a portfolio they didn't have a resume so
when you see on LinkedIn 300 applications to a job you know 280 of

00:14
them are just Clickers right they're just Clickers who applies without a resume
this person this person applies without the resume
but here's what they think they think they have a resume
but their resume is hot garbage haha garbage right
they talk down about themselves they don't highlight their skills or
experiences appropriately and so even though they might have a resume there's
grammatical errors it's a dumpster fire right and they're not following an
appropriate template for a resume they just kind of grab something off of canva
and ran with it that's not how this works folks ATS is looking for very
specific things like the automatic automatic systems that are looking
through it recruiters are looking for very specific things so who's not

00:15
applying it's not they're not applying with it they just didn't put any thought
into it they didn't put any they didn't put any logic into it right
all right so grab the checklist has everything that you need right has
everything you need uh to make sure that your Hunt is set up appropriately now
before you go off the deep end before you even start working through the
checklist the most important thing you need to
think about is crafting your story right crafting your story is a very
simple concept but it's hard in execution you're trying to answer the
question why are you here when you show up for an interview
why are you showing up for this interview what is the plausible reason

00:16
that got you from where you were to where you are now
you don't want to show up to an interview be like well I need money
so that's why I'm here um you need a story that helps you pass the
sniff test why are you the most amazing engineer how have your background your
skills and experience made you the best engineer for this job
I don't care what you did before you can
craft that into a plausible reason as to
why you're the best engineer for the job
somebody put a job in chat for me please just throw a job and chat
like like a non-coding job bartender all right bartender was the first one I saw

00:17
in chat somebody give me a company random company like a random tech company
oh y'all went too fast the second time Twitter I saw Twitter all right but it
was the first one I saw bartender and Twitter
foreign so off the Dome how I'd craft my story over the years
I've had the privilege of working with great software and horrible software in
my last opportunity I had to use a point
of sale system that continuously did not work
I would enter in orders I would enter in drinks and it just would never it would
never work for myself it would irate me and it would upset my customers I
decided then and there to learn how to write better code to fix these

00:18
point-of-sale systems so that individuals could have the best
experience right now I know that Twitter is on the precipice of Designing new
experiences for their users you're testing things like the edit button and
things that will fundamentally change discourse on the internet I want to be
at a company where I can put together my past experiences building wonderful uis
that Delight users that make people happy and bring say bring that same
skill set and experience to Twitter foreign why are you here
right why are you here you need that story you need the ability
to talk highly about your past experience I don't care what you did

00:19
before there is a way to craft that in a way that makes you a better engineer
today because I'm telling you the folks that you're going up against the folks
that are coming out of these four-year degree programs that don't have a
hundred dollars project that haven't worked with real clients that don't have
real professional experience You Should Be Dancing circles around them your past
experience all right your past experience is the Difference Maker
is the thing that's going to set you apart not hold you back so crafting your
stories the first thing that you need to invest some time in doing uh Stephanie
did say that they're going to come back and help us craft the story so we'll get
that scheduled for one of our Mondays but that's the first thing you need to
spend your time on why are you here because that story that's the first
sniff test anyone coming out of this program has a

00:20
smell you have the boot camper smell right you have a boot camper smell so
how do you get rid of that boot camper smell well having a well-crafted story
that doesn't highlight that you just learned how to code that doesn't
highlight that you just learned JavaScript four months ago right none of
that gets highlighted your skill set your experience the
things that you're able to do time does not matter what can you do what have you
done and what could you do for that company that's what matters and that's
what you need to highlight and that's why crafting your story
becomes so important how do you address your story for
different companies in different sectors that's the hard part you should have a
different story for every company you apply to

00:21
now you can you can mold that UI example
to be a bunch of different companies but when you're talking to a recruiter
when you're talking to that first gatekeeper for that company that you're
trying to apply to you want a well-crafted story that explains why you
showed up why are you here it's not because you just completed a boot camp
and you want a job it's because your past skill set and experience is align
with the opportunity in front of you right you have to be doing these things
that reduce your smell do not put Junior anywhere in your title
do not put aspiring on your Twitter if
you write code you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] software
engineer and your online presence should reflect that

00:22
don't snitch on yourself don't undersell yourself bruh
you all have amazing projects you've worked with real clients committed real
code to real open source projects you've built some amazing stuff
do not sell yourself short The Hunt is not the time to be humble
The Hunt is the time to put your best foot forward to do everything you can to
reduce the smell and to get a job leave humble at home exactly blah cool foreign
important to remember that first nif test is really to get you to the Nerds
right A lot of times in the process there's a recruiter that's in your way
there's an HR person that's in your way there's somebody that's trying to

00:23
qualify whether or not you are worthy enough to interview those first persons
really have no ability to evaluate whether or not you go to the next round
right I mean sorry whether or not you get hired they're kind of just there to
make sure that they're not putting too much of a burden on the Nerds that
actually will do the evaluation as to whether or not you're a good fit and so
there are a lot of things you can do that past sniff tests right no person
ever got in trouble referring someone to the engineers that graduated from MIT
right that just that just passes the sniff test for you right and so what you
have to think about or what are the things that are going to help me pass
that initial sniff test so that the person that says they were worthy to go
talk to the engineers knew how to code right that they were a a good software

00:24
engineer what are those things that you show up as that you talk about yourself
as that they say you know what you should go on to the technical portion of
this interview things like a well-manicured GitHub with
your green squares does it work for everyone no but does it work for some
yes they see that you're pushing code every day pass the test
they see that you have amazing projects in your portfolio past the test will
everyone look at your portfolio no but some might
do you have real clients yes you passed the test do you have real people that
could talk about your engineers yes you pass the test there are all these things
that you could be doing that help reduce
that smell and that's what we're talking about tonight
the goal is to get to the Nerds once you
get to the Nerds it really comes down to two questions
can this person code and do I want to work with them for the next two years

00:25
can this person code and do I want to work with them for the
next two years that's it that's what they're trying to surmise once you get
past that original person once you get to the nerves once you get
to the technical folks can you code it won't work for the next two years and
the beautiful thing is you can game either one of these
you could be really great at coding and get the job you could be really great at
the person wanting to work with you for the next two years and also get the job
the reason why we talk through prep the reason why we talk through the ways that
you go about these interviews that we're going to get to in a little bit is
because each person that you're interviewing with typically has a vote
they get to say whether or not you go to the next round right whether or not you
get hired whether or not they would want to be your co-worker
and so when you're in these interviews it comes down to can you code
I want to work with you for the next two years and you can play both of those

00:26
games mine was that I got my job being good at
the second one not the first but it worked hell yes
yeah and it's very true the definition of can code varies hugely between
different groups of nerds exactly one one group of nerds might look at your
100 products it can go damn this person knows how to code another group of nerds
might look at your GitHub and go damn they push code every day they know how
to code we don't know what each company is going to use as the
metric of success that's why all this is about is opening as many doors as
possible some people will come to me and
say Leon no one's looked at my portfolio great you haven't run into the people
that care about your portfolio Leon nobody's looked at my resume great you
haven't run into the people that look at your resume we're talking about 60
companies give it some time we talk about 180 people at those 60 companies

00:27
give yourself some time and find your group of nerds some interviews go
horrible some interviews go well we had well blah blunted it during the tea
spill but we've had Engineers that one day they completely
they cried in an interview were made to cry an interview and then the next day
got a six-figure offer that person did not change from Wednesday to Thursday
why was one interview hell and the other interview heaven
they did not change in less than 24 hours it's because different companies
test different things different people work at different companies you're gonna
find a fit the reasons I say you apply to 60 companies and not apply Network
your way into 60 companies is because there are 60 different cultures there

00:28
are 60 different groups of people you find you're fit and that's when this
stuff goes well the numbers game you're playing a
numbers game do not get upset at yourself because the first 10 don't go
your way you just haven't found your people yet just takes one
it just takes one out of the 60. some folks get lucky it's the first one they
ever do some folks do 55 and that's when they find it
cool now one of the first things you need to do one of the first few doors
you're gonna open that reduce the smell and make it likely for you to make it
into the initial rounds of interviewing or your portfolio your Twitter and your
LinkedIn now telescope thieves uh who went on to get an amazing job uh
they had something to say and I kind of mentioned a little bit earlier

00:29
just had a coffee chat was told they see so many applicants with empty githubs
no portfolios and no projects under their belts on the right track y'all and
definitely giving us the cheat codes I agree with this wholeheartedly
you know how I know that this is true do you want to know how I know that this
is true without a shadow of the doubt it's because I've been asking
the 1300 people that are here for for months to push to GitHub every day
to have a good portfolio and to build a 100 hours project and um
some of you don't have it done so when you've been in a program

00:30
that asks you week after week month after month to do this stuff and you're
not doing it how is some poor sucker off the street getting it done
it just ain't it just ain't happening so that means when you do it
when you have the portfolio that's popping you have the Twitter that's
looking good you have the Lincoln that's standing out right
you're putting yourself ahead of the pack not all the way to the front but
you're running it with a different group of people you ever watched like a you
ever watched like a competitive race right there's two packs right you have
the folks that are actually trying to win the race and everyone else
you at least want to be in the group of folks that are trying to win the race
don't be in that group of folks that don't

00:31
have their portfolio their Twitter their LinkedIn their GitHub all that crap
you're still running but you ain't gonna get anywhere you're
not gonna win nothing why put in all the effort why put in the
work why are you still running if you're not going to do the stuff that's going
to literally help you win the race it makes no sense just stop
I don't hope you stop I hope you do the things that you know are going to open
the doors I hope you do the things that you know are going to be the difference
in getting the job run with the front of the pack right
run with the front of the pack run with the folks that actually want to win
right run with the folks that are going to get the job done
get this stuff done it helps you open the doors and I'm gonna say it and I'll
be the first person to say it you don't need to open every door

00:32
but the more you open the more you open the more likely you are to get a job
yeah Dr Eric Thomas exactly um winners when losers lose
it's a really rough saying some people really take this saying to heart and I
wish I hope you understand what they're trying to say winners find a way to win
did Jeff lose I'm gonna I'm gonna [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cry did Jeff lose no
because winners win and losers lose Jeff had every log thrown their way

00:33
every log thrown their way months in between interviewing but winners win
and losers lose because losers give up that's it
that's it winners find a way to win that's it
that's it there's can't say it no better winners win losers lose winners find a
way to win Jeff was our last tea spill um for folks that missed the T spill uh
Jeff had some things come up in life they they stopped the first cohort they
joined the ketchup crew uh they they they they they had a lot of things that
got in their way but winners win and losers lose Jeff
found a way did Jeff open all the doors I'm asking you to open no they found the

00:34
ones that made it possible for them to win so I'm showing you all the freaking
doors that I can it's up to you to figure out which ones you want to open
cool starts off with your portfolio your Twitter your LinkedIn uh blah sorry
here's Bloss portfolio beautiful portfolio full stack software engineer I
that worked uh beautiful website good about me why are they here what are
they doing projects that they've worked on the things they could do for you
right and at the end uh you can see that it was a template right
no need if you're not a designer use a
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] template that's it you don't
need to you don't need a big brain it you don't need to overthink it

00:35
yeah yeah tell them about themselves May sunflower uh it should be saying senior
software engineer blah come on now senior software engineer
right completely free you just grab it plug in your stuff you
got yourself a portfolio and I love this portfolio because not only did it help
them get a senior software engineering job for their first engineering job but
it also helped them land a thousand dollar client off the rip
not not anything wild re-template beautiful portfolio
great client amazing job don't overthink it
uh Twitter Twitter is a powerful tool to help you find a job
um I love Jeff's Twitter I think it's pretty simple and uh

00:36
kind of just has a nice photo Jeff developer photographer animal lover
cheese guy uh says what they are what they do what they're into what they do
at their free time I love it I love that it says cheese Enthusiast
that's gonna that's gonna I'm gonna be interested in that what is the cheese
Enthusiast right that's something we're gonna talk about you don't have to
overthink it simple to the point fill it out say what you do what you're into
make it look good don't have just like a blank background right
a little bit of effort yep and don't waste time redoing
perfectly good portfolios good call blah get it done and move on with the hunt
is Twitter really need it yes it is a door that you can open does
everyone open it no but it's a really important door because
a lot of developers a lot of developers hang out on Twitter

00:37
it's an easy way to network with individuals the the trick that I've
taught or I showed you what I do is I have private Twitter lists
I put every person that I'm trying to network my way into like to get a job on
that private Twitter list start liking their posts
retweet them every once in a while leave a comment you do that for a couple of
weeks you went from a nobody to an acquaintance
and acquaintances get their DMS read so is Twitter necessary
it's a door that you can open I think it's a really important door
it's the easiest way I know to turn a massive amount of developers into folks

00:38
that'll actually give you time of day Twitter's helped me meet connect with
lots of devs yes it's just it's just the
easiest it's just the easiest way I know to interact with a lot of folks quickly
and build up that rapport with individuals especially in Tech so is it
necessary it's a door I think you should open it I think you
should take it seriously I think you should build private lists of all the
folks that are on your Hit List which we'll get to in a little bit that you
want to reach out to that you want to engage with and start engaging with them
just like leave some comments get on their radar and when the time is right
you can reach out via DM say hey I saw you have an open position I would love
to to chat about the role boom coffee chats amazing Twitter so easy to
find folks and talk to folks and get coffee chats to build up that Network
Twitter feels more social compared to LinkedIn it is it's way more relaxed

00:39
right it's way more relaxed it's a little bit easier to interact with folks
um Sam I think is a master class on this
I know Sam is stepping away from Twitter now um
but if you just go to their Twitter and like start from the beginning like I'm
dead serious if you want a master class on how to do Twitter right
on how to like grow a network uh to meet other developers Sam is the best I've
ever seen in the whole wide world and they they started with 100 devs and really
took the Twitter very quickly go to their profile start at the beginning and
look at the tweets they sent look how they interacted with people uh it's just
it just really is worthwhile to spend that time yeah hey profits
uh and then last but not least is is LinkedIn uh you want a decent LinkedIn um
I still want to pop up somebody's message so I'm going to open this over

00:40
here real quick so Nick was one of our other tea
Spillers I think they have a pretty solid um they have a pretty solid
uh LinkedIn as well and so it's all linked here in the slides I love that
they put software engineer right in the right in the title
um they're connected with a lot of folks they put their what they do where
they're based all the stuff that we actually do like the stuff that's in the
resume template they put into the LinkedIn they shared some important
stuff uh they list 100 devs they list some of this other stuff they've done in
the past right um and then what I also love is that
they've joined the 100 devs right they joined the 100 devs group on LinkedIn
and they asked folks for endorsements so did a recruiter ever get in trouble

00:41
recommending someone that had 60 endorsements for JavaScript and 59
endorsements for react and 59 endorsements for node.js nah
what up Nick hey juice nah so get on get on the LinkedIn group
and say hey I would love to be endorsed for JavaScript react node and we see
somebody post it boom hit it up that's it
if they're in the 100 devs group do they know JavaScript yes do they know react
the basics yes did they know JS yes so is it hard to recommend somebody for
those three things when you know they went through this program and did all
three of them no boom so go through and do it
and they got 20 other skills too which is pretty dope uh so I think this
LinkedIn is a pretty good LinkedIn uh definitely go through it make sure yours

00:42
mimics this uh I also shared um Danny Thompson's LinkedIn course I
really do recommend it it's completely free it'll walk you through all the
things you need to be thinking about when setting up your LinkedIn uh I need a
need a Like a Knife bot command for that course but it's on Discord I've shared
it before um make sure you you can just go through
the follow-on materials channel search for LinkedIn and it'll pop up
how many LinkedIn endorsements is too many there is no such thing as too many
you know is that a YouTube course yeah he has it
on YouTube it's like four videos where he shares like all the most um
all the most important stuff to think about when going through Linkedin so yeah
uh will you checked under every LinkedIn group for folks who are waiting yeah I
added everyone last week uh so if you just recently
um signed it up I'll check after class to get most folks in I do not accept you

00:43
if you do not have a profile like if you don't have a name and a photo I don't
accept you hey Reviving Juliet that's awesome first
time chatter uh thought I'd share I'm the ketchup crew uh your info especially
stuff on passing the sniff test and getting socials in order got me a three
thousand dollar freelancing client that's huge congrats uh first ever money
I made from coding boom packet Discord said tons of people are
adding me on LinkedIn without a message never ever although those
clickers don't ever add somebody on LinkedIn without a message
even it's just hey we're both in 100 devs loved your profile send a message
let them know why you're adding them on LinkedIn your
LinkedIn if you got anything if you got anything

00:44
from my speed run classes what was the one thing that you just kept seeing in
my speed run classes what did you see like every single time
I was finding somebody a job I was looking at looking up a job I was
looking for people that worked at that company what did you see every single
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time yes I was sending them personalized
messages but I was connected to them already they were always second connections
almost every single person I pulled up random people from random companies I
was connected to I treat my LinkedIn like gold
I add folks that I know so that when I see that I'm connected to someone I can
ask for the connection right treat your LinkedIn that way too
right if you actually know somebody from 100 devs then add them like if you
worked on a project with them if you've met them in voice chat don't just

00:45
randomly add them like having more people on LinkedIn doesn't really do
anything for you but when you can use it
as a real Network to get intros that's a whole different story cool
and uh last but not least before we move on we're going to take a break
all right let's we can take a break here when we come back I'll talk about kind
of the things we just covered so we're at the top of the hour if you're new
around these parts we'd like to take a break at the top of every hour to be
healthy if you are able all right if you're able please get up
move around hydrate take care of yourself um Taz Express 2022 gave me a hydrate
thank you bid mule and player 09x give me a
posture check I'm going to get into that the only JCS give me another hydrate
thank you and government tour gave us a two minute extension on the first timer

00:46
so this will be a not a five minute break but a seven minute break folks please
you're able go look out the window go tell somebody you love them all right
so we talked about kind of portfolio Twitter LinkedIn um
now we have the portfolio piece so here's my little bit of code for you uh
if designer equals true then go ahead and design your portfolio if not use a
template all right um somebody says you're a developer why
did you use a template uh because I'm not a designer
my designs look like garbage do you want somebody that makes garbage designs or
somebody that can build amazing products because I can build amazing products my
designs just look like hot garbage because I'm not a designer

00:47
all right so templates the place to start uh is HTML5 up uh they just have free
templates they're not shady like they don't have like weird stuff like I don't
know there's a lot of places when you try to download templates you always
wind up with like an extra buddy on your computer
um and so I like this site they're free uh once you get a paid client I am
definitely a fan of using better templates uh theme virus has a lot of
them uh depends what you want to use like there are a lot of like Tailwind
templates down stuff like that so um there these are like the only places to
find them but just kind of like once you
get a client and if you have some of the money coming in from your client work
and you want a better template you can but this is totally fine
people get amazing clients amazing jobs with just HTML5 ohm templates so don't
don't stress it uh hosting for your templates uh for your for your
basic portfolio and stuff just use netlify netlify.com drop is super easy

00:48
you literally drag your folder onto netlify.drop and it hosts it instantly
um you don't need to buy a domain you can just use the netlify dot app
um one of the examples I always give is Sean
um RC alumni and definitely helps a lot of folks here at 100 devs uh they
famously got an offer at Amazon and an amazing client just using the netlify
domain like it was just the Sean uh there's like Sean Charles at dot netlify
dot app and that got them a job at Fang and an amazing client so you don't need
to buy a domain you can use the netlify dot app for whatever a completely free
to host and to use that domain but if you do want to buy a domain uh name
cheap and I want my name or where I think you should get your domains from
but once again this is a completely free program do not pay for anything you do

00:49
not need to buy a domain you can just use netlify.app and it
works just as fine nobody cares cool uh next bit of things that we need to
help us pass the sniff test is the resume so the resume is pretty
interesting I've given you this example resume here this Bob coder you'll notice
that it's a docx never use docx always always export this as a PDF I
just use that so that it's easier for folks to edit however they want to edit it
um this resume just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works it just works it just works
you don't need to use something else it just works
right and so I think a lot of folks say Leon like my um my resume is holding me
back because you're not using the template just use this templated resume

00:50
it just works your resume should be one page and it should be this thing this
resume has tables it does not if you save it as a PDF it does not have tables
I don't know where that came from it's not true if you can when you go to
the PDF and you highlight over it if you see that happen then you you know that
it can be seen by ATS if when you highlight it you see it pop
up that's that's ATS approved I can also show it to you by going to the CV
compiler which picks up everything so TV compiler they do have a free version uh
and that free version um that free version will show you that
it is ATS compliant uh people think like ATS is like a fancy
thing all ATS is doing is like yanking text and so if you're able to yoink text

00:51
from a PDF then your resume is ATS compliant mm-hmm
so here is the Bob coder resume in CV compiler
you'll notice that all the normal stuff looks good there are a few things that
we could change though right there are a few things that we
could change so I'm actually probably going to be uh I'm gonna probably be
updating this a little bit because there are two big things I think we should
change uh in demand Tech skills this just changes over time
um so they analyzed a thousand vacancies
at Big tech companies and they found out that there are some technologies that
are good to have and um so we probably want to swap in some
of these words just to to to to to make sure we're getting picked up by a
company that doesn't actually look at your resume right some companies don't
look at your resume they just use a computer to say whether or not you're a
good fit so by having these in-demand skills you can just screenshot this from

00:52
the video I would be good things to add whatever you feel like is a good fit or
you want to invest some time it could be a good fit
um and then the other thing that was a thing here is that these Niche skills we
have to add some of these uh and so we're probably going to figure out how
to add some of these we will probably have like an extra class uh where we
work through this um but all the other stuff was was fine
uh and so I think this is pretty good uh you'll see some stuff that I don't
recommend like the certifications I'm not a big fan of putting certifications
on your resume I think that smells um so this is kind of where ATS versus
what's going to actually work and so um for me this resume has been used by
hundreds and hundreds of folks that have
gotten jobs right literally hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of folks that have gotten jobs I really do believe that it
works and I hope that you use it too uh even AWS certs uh yeah no those are

00:53
like professional certs so like professional search you can keep
um but things that are like like things that just show that you just
learned how to code keep off your resume yeah like AWS Azure and Google Cloud
certs are my exceptions anything else I don't put on my resume I think that
somebody sees that and it might hold you back does it does it always hold you
back no but I think for a lot of folks it can
yeah no udemy certs or things like that um so yeah we might have to change up
some of these skills based off of what uh the CV compiler is saying the link
the CV compiler is here in chat so once you fill out your resume you definitely
want to run it through CV compiler um it's free like you don't pay like
don't pay like there's more stuff that you can see
right right there's more stuff that you can see if you pay but you don't need

00:54
that just make sure that it passes the basic checks that they give you if
you're wondering what CV compiler would say you need help with it's this stuff
pause the video it's this stuff pause the video this stuff there you go
that's everything y'all cool so if you use this resume template you pass
the CV compiler after you're done editing it you'll know everything that
works and that you um are picked up on it cool see if you
can probably get the hug of death yeah I think we sent a lot of people that way

00:55
cool all right cover letter there's another
example it's in the template sorry it's in the checklist so in the checklist it
gives you an example of it but if you need an example of a cover letter I got
you here you go cover letter that you can you can work through
um it's all there for you let's real quick before we go on to the cover
letter I do want to take a second to talk about the resume
um I kind of just showed it to you but I do want to talk about it real quick
you'll notice that how long we've talked about this a lot how long does
a recruiter or the initial gatekeeper spend reading your resume on average

00:56
six seconds all right um timer all right you tell me when it hit when
we hit when we hit six seconds all right creative detail oriented

00:57
software engineer with a deep interest in AI proven track record foreign
and it's all you need to know I'm a creative detail-oriented software
engineer with a deep interest in Ai and a proven track record boom that's it
that's it if you have something like I'm an aspiring Junior engineer bruh
bruh nah get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here they
got six seconds to figure out who you are what you do right let's try it again
ready I'm gonna you tell me when six seconds are over chat
I'm gonna I'm gonna start at software engineer and work my way through I'm

00:58
gonna skip the summary software engineer software engineer 100 devs they built a
company for some coffee company they're a full stack developer at some
Consulting agency so in those six seconds I saw that
you're a software engineer you worked as a software engineer you did some
Consulting do you go on to the next round or not
right like you got to think about this it's not just the computer that you're
playing right it's not just the computer that you're playing
right it's not just a computer you're playing there's also the the way that
you structure your resume you're you're going up against the recruiter as well
right you're going up against a recruiter as well mm-hmm
and so you got to think about what they're going to see you're going to

00:59
notice that I have very quickly my experiences at
100 devs I have my projects that look like real companies right
right that like when people when you put your projects don't be like
an app I worked on during class time no frame it as though is a real company
right just like it just just give it a name hip coffee co uh
happy notes we did a to-do list happy notes right give it a name
um even like in other projects too like a lot of stuff that we did right it's
the way you talk about it uh we built a slot machine don't call it
a slot machine call it a small Lakes casino virtual slot machine uh we built
uh a NASA API don't say don't say uh NASA API project no it's the Los Angeles

01:00
Stargazer Society a picture of the day web app with NASA API integration
if you were here for the very first JavaScript class you built a background
picker for a YouTuber that YouTuber was me so you made an on-demand background
color picture changer for a partner twitch streamer and many more
don't snitch on yourself don't underplay the real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
you've done give it a name talk your talk
uh I'm a big fan of having your projects in line with 100 devs because we saw
what six seconds gives you in those six seconds the reason I
skipped from software engineer to full stack web developer is because I saw
that there were some real looking projects on here
so I didn't have to actually read them I just jumped to the next thing

01:01
and in those six seconds I saw two experiences as an engineer
that enabled me to be like oh okay this person's probably an engineer
passes the sniff test yep and then you put the other stuff you
want here I'm a big fan of having a volunteer section and then the big thing
people always stress about is their education
um you don't have to put the dates of your education if you don't want to right
and then if you're just spending six seconds on this what are you what are
you noticing about this right away I I purposely let something off here I
didn't snitch on I didn't snitch on Bob here does this say Bob has a degree
no this Bob does not have a degree from UMass Boston but their major was
business administration no degree no graduation date but if you're only
spending six [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seconds looking at

01:02
this would you ever hyper focus on that nah you wouldn't even notice it
all right but never even notice it uh and you don't have to put dates dates
can be snitching on yourself for a lot of folks a lot of folks if you if you
complete your degree 20 years ago good don't put dates on there
will the technical interviewer notice probably not
most technical interviewers do the exact
same thing if they even read your resume
if they even read your resume they spend six seconds on it
so if you're stressing about what to do for Education boom that's it you don't
have you don't have to have a graduation date you don't have to have your degree

01:03
right that's it beautiful cool all right so that's the the resume there
I'm a big fan of having 100 devs and then um you're freelancing separate and
then any other job that you think is worthwhile to put on there have real
targeted goals like things that you actually did numbers are better um yeah
cool and I love having at least one like Tech related volunteering in there so
many conferences are coming up just volunteer for a conference and throw
that on there it's just good to have a little bit of something Tech related
that's not job related on there it just gives you something to talk about a lot
of times when I'm in interviews with folks I'm like oh you went to the free
software um like you went to Libre Planet which is
their conference and like yeah I was there like oh and I just gives you
something to talk about cool resume we talked about cover letter GitHub

01:04
GitHub please use the profile generator make your GitHub look good
your GitHub should have nowadays with GitHub you can have a beautiful readme
file for your whole profile so that your GitHub looks great right have you ever
saw somebody's GitHub and it's like whoa this GitHub looks dope they were
probably using some sort of generator uh and so this generator will help you
figure out like what to put like what you want to do right so hi my you put
your name in you put the project that you're currently working on you put a
link to it you check off the skills that you that you have right and um you can
put in all your Social Links if you want and then you just generate it and it'll
give me a it'll give you a file right it'll give you a file that you can add
to your GitHub uh and that'll give you just like a nice a nice GitHub uh
profile that looks good mm-hmm that looks good

01:05
it has been real lord I appreciate that um and then the other thing you want to
do is you want to use this readme template for every single project for
every single project that you have on your GitHub there should be a beautiful
readme for it and you have like what it does a link to it live you have a gif
record a gif of your project so that it's like moving and looks good
right put the technology that you use so you're getting picked up by the sweet
sweet robots and then my face part is the optimizations you don't even have to
code the hard Parts just say the stuff that you would have done had you had
more time right shows that you know what it is you just didn't do it yet
cool and then the last thing is like give them other examples to to click
through to right so right give them some other stuff that

01:06
you could you could click yet uh some other stuff that they can click
through too so if they did land on this template they can see the other stuff
that you built what's the best thing you used to record for those screen gifts
um I use Cloud app which is free I don't know if that's Mac only
um but I I use cloud I was just really easy just like you just grab a window
like you're taking a screenshot and it turns it into a gif for you but I'm sure
there are plenty of other ones some people are saying share X is free pick pick
um OBS yeah if you just do like a screen recording if you wanted to
um screen to get there's like a couple of ones that people are recommend I
don't know any of those except for OBS but I use I use Cloud app and I guess
I've done it in OBS before too TJ Khan is saying don't use GitHub
Street generator though if you've backed it your pushes on the generator it'll
tell on you uh yeah so uh the other thing that we're trying to do with our

01:07
githubs is push every day and the reason why we push every day on
GitHub is because recruiters love those green squares they do they do they do
and so you want a GitHub that has a that every single day it looks like you push
code right and on GitHub every day you push code you get a green square but
some days you miss a push or some days you realize you haven't pushed in a
month and you want to back date all those green squares you can do it uh
shout out hellos Rufio uh hello it's Rufio an illustrious member of the
stream team has a VOD on how to fill in your green squares if you don't know how
to do that uh and so you can watch that VOD if you
missed a few but those green squares are really important because no recruiter

01:08
no recruiter ever got in trouble recommending somebody that pushed code
every single day think about that they they recommend they recommend
somebody to the next round and the person says this person was
horrible like they didn't know how to code it all and the recruiter goes oh
they pushed every single day to GitHub that's it end the story oh I guess well
that's weird I don't know what's going on then right like so it's one of those
things that's one of the easiest way to pass that sniff test all right
now does every single recruiter care about it obviously no but the ones that do
oh boy oh boy when they're looking at two
candidates one candidate has a dusty ass

01:09
udemy tutorial from 10 years ago and you got pushes every single day who's going
to the next round you are my friend you are
had a coffee chat with a Dev when they saw my green squares daily said that no
that's bad it's because they feel bad that you're a better engineer pushing
more code doing more work getting more things done and it makes them feel bad
about themselves because they can't keep up with your productivity they got got
now the next thing the next thing is you want a hundred hours project
um your beautiful MVPs are due technically the whole project is due but
what are deadlines anymore this is the penultimate class who cares um

01:10
your 100 hours project is the culmination of what you're able to do
right of what you're able to do what you're able to build the things you're
able to accomplish it can be something that ties your past into your present it
is the thing that comes up the most honestly in your interviews
it is literally the thing that comes up the most if you've come to any of the
tea spills most of the folks that were getting jobs didn't even have
technical interviews because all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
was in a row lined up button on top ribbon tied do they have a portfolio
pass the sniff test do they have a good GitHub pass the sniff test do they have

01:11
real big projects pass the sniff test do they have real people they work with
real clients pass the sniff test right we have to realize is that all
these things are opening doors and when all the doors are open you can fit an
elephant through and so that 100 hours project you need
to have done is the culmination of your work it's taking a hundred hours to
build something that your own that you can talk through from beginning to end
that you can show all all of your knowledge off right
and it comes up the most so many interviewers will say hey show me
projects that you've built oh I saw on your GitHub this was your PIN project
tell me about it right this is the thing that gets jobs don't be this person
don't be this person this person we know didn't have a good GitHub didn't have a

01:12
hundred hours project didn't have real clients didn't have
a well manicured portfolio didn't have a beautiful resume
this is the person I'm talking about thank you blah don't be this person
all right all these things matter wasn't as dope of us no you're built
different I just I just want to get into your brain how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome
you are I don't know how to to like to to get that I just want you to
believe that because you are you're going up against chumps that don't know
what they're doing that think that they
spent four years [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around to get a
degree that don't have any real projects in their portfolio is enough it's not

01:13
enough show me your GitHub show me your projects show me who you worked with
show me the real clients you worked with show me your pushes
you're going up against scrubs and on TLC I don't want no scrubs in 100 devs
because you're not we're built different we've done the work
we've done what we needed to do we're not this person all right now
once you have all this stuff your your groundwork has been laid
you're going to be able to get past that first person you're going to be able to
get past that first nif test you need to start opening up doors into companies

01:14
and the most important thing that you will do
like outside of like once you have your professional stuff set up literally the
most important thing you will do is your hit list gets jobs
if you've done if you do nothing else other than get all your professional
stuff all your projects done and then do a hit list
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coding challenges screw lead code
Wars don't matter if you just built up all the stuff we talked about thus far
and then dumped every last waking moment into your Hit List you would get a job
because networking your way into an opportunity counts way more than
anything else getting your stuff in front of a real human being that can see
your real projects that can see your real experience and can see the things
that you can do that's why we do The Hit List so the hit list is probably the

01:15
most important thing you will ever do for your career and you start off by
using the sheet so you can do exclamation point sheet inside of
chat here you'll have your general networking but there's also The Hit List
uh we've done two classes where we've done The Hit List live I set the world
record price I still have the world record folks I haven't seen anybody
break that world record yet and guess what uh in a couple couple
weeks probably I'm gonna do it again I'm waiting for folks to break it I want
somebody to break it I still owe somebody their hit list so I'm gonna
give you all a week or two to break it and then I'm coming for y'all I'm gonna
be I gotta be the two-time world record holder right and so I threw down the
challenge already nobody beat it I mean it's a hard let's be real it's hard to
beat that record uh but as soon as it's broken I'm gonna do another one to show
that I'm I'm that guy and I also owe somebody their hit list so personally I
owe for your Hit List we're still gonna do it just give me a little bit to dunk

01:16
on someone it's hard it is hard it is hard um
that's why we did it live I wanted to show you how I did it
um and we added all those companies in that short period we did added 30
companies in one class session that's wild
uh so the way that The Hit List works is
you find a company that has an open role and then you find the people that work
at that company right uh your goal is to
network your way in to 60 companies that have open roles right where you're not
just clicking apply right where you're not just clicking apply
all right you're not just clicking pie you're not working your way into 60
companies you're gonna find the hiring manager that company if you can you're
going to add them to your Hit List you're going to follow them on Twitter

01:17
you're going to find their email and Hunter i o you're going to ask for a
coffee chat you're gonna send a thank you you're gonna get the recommendation
to that job if you don't know how to ask for a coffee chat you don't know how to
send a thank you exclamation point template here in chat
exclamation point templates here in chat it might be templates
the template or templates as templates here you go
expiration Point templates and chat thank you Stephanie how do I send a
coffee chat request boom look at these messages you can be
sending how do I send a thank you note boom here's how you can send a thank you
note how do I ask for an introduction boom how do I follow up boom

01:18
it's all here folks it's all here what you waiting for
it's all here and if you want to see 40 messages that I sent
40 messages to real people the actual messages I would send all right
go watch the previous two classes here that are vods on Twitch
right both those classes have the 40 different people I reached out to 40
different messages exactly what I would send use that as your springboard to
figure out how you could tweak those messages to be the messages that you
need to send and then don't overthink it don't overthink it it's 180 people
you're gonna get ghosted by most you're gonna get ghosted by most
that's okay are those classes on YouTube not yet they will make it on there
eventually uh YouTube always lags behind it's just a pain in the butt for me to

01:19
edit stuff and put it up but all the vods are here on Twitch uh so you can
always grab the vods on Twitch they make it over to YouTube because I don't
monetize my YouTube so there's no ads on YouTube
um so yeah twitch I think twitch runs ads on the vods which kind of sucks but
uh yeah on YouTube I don't monetize any of my videos so you can watch all the
videos ad free and they eventually make it up there it just takes me a little
while to get them up cool uh most will ghost you uh you got
to keep that in mind that's okay we're playing the numbers game folks numbers
game uh you find the hiring manager you can't
find them you find an engineer on the team you can't find engineer on the team
you find the recruiter you can't find the recruiter you find their mama
and you say that's the for a coffee chat right you're trying to find these folks
uh so let's do a live let's do one I know we did two classes on let's do one

01:20
live uh somebody give me a a location kinetic uh what was the first one the
first one was actually Denver let's go ahead Denver let's go to Angelus
Angel list or angelco.jobs there we go boom uh I have like an unreasonable fear
of typing in Angel list because of Angel Fire anybody remember Angel Fire
Angel Fire was like a competitor to geocities
anybody remember what happens if you misspelled Angel Fire
anybody have this memory is it just me yeah I just took you to a porn site I

01:21
just took you to a porn site so I remember being like on on the on the
library computer trying to go to Angel Fire mistyping it I'm trying to go to my
Harry Potter Dragon Ball Z fan site and uh some stuff popped up and that that
memory just forever uh emblazed in my mind because I spelled I think I spelled
Angel angle or something like that it was a typo yeah
memories all right uh let's change this to Denver
Colorado uh we're gonna make sure that there's no um we're gonna turn off the
remote job we're just going to look for local
um I have if we look at my filters I am filtering out senior lead staff
principal manager director just like I don't want to see those I'm looking for
entry-level roles so I filter those out I'm looking for a JavaScript node
node.js you don't have to hold yourself to that it's going to filter out a lot

01:22
right now um we see a back-end developer role uh full stack engineer
Uh Kevin Davey is listed as the the contact uh they don't have anything here but
maybe we can find them on LinkedIn Kevin Davey on LinkedIn or we can even say
what was the name of the site sticky leaf they link it if you leave Co
all right so what I would do right off the rip is we could take sticky Leaf
coat I don't think it'll probably come up in Hunter but we can try dream job
whoa what's this new domain search okay come on you're you're killing me

01:23
live here all right they didn't have any results I'm pretty sure
that it would probably just be Kevin at Sticky Leaf Co and so I would send an
email to Kevin right as sticky Leaf Co and I would say to Kevin
this is my dream dreams do come true would be my would be my headline I saw
that you were looking for a full stack engineer on Angel list I am in the
Denver area I feel like I could be a really good fit for this role uh please
respond I'm desperately waiting for your wrist
now please respond uh I would love to connect about the open roles uh in the
next coming days right boom that's it takes took us what 30 seconds to find
that it was Kevin stickylief.co send an email right and you shoot it off
um 50 to 70k but they're giving up three

01:24
percent equity if that means anything to you it shouldn't uh Equity almost never
matters you shouldn't really you should like take it off the table when
considering uh but I don't know what the Denver Market is 70 might be low but um
foreign who cares you don't you don't pre-qualify the leads get the offer and
then negotiate get the offer and maybe you don't wind
up going the sticky Leaf maybe you wind up going to Josh AI but you have a 70k
offer for sticky leaf and you go to Josh hey hey I already got an offer from the
Denver area is there any way that you can get me closer to that 120 that you
listed on the job application right I already have an offer but Josh AI is
where I want to be I can't see myself working anywhere else besides Josh AI is
there any wiggle room to get me closer uh to the to the listed amount on your
application that's it so don't ever pre-qualify
based on how much money the language don't do any of that get the offer and

01:25
then you can negotiate right that's it if you want to see the
real examples the real things I would send the real letters all that stuff we
did 40 of these in the previous two classes they're either probably on
YouTube right now um if you're watching this in the future
or you can check the vods on Twitch boom but don't don't take yourself out
the game let them take you out the game that's it don't ever be a Clicker
all right now eventually once you're in the throes
of interviewing and you are starting to get
you're you're going to be interviewing at 60 right so those first few
interviews or should be ones that you don't really care about honestly
right uh it should be ones that you that you really don't

01:26
that if you got the job great if you don't who cares right get your licks in
make sure that you get more comfortable interviewing you kind of see what the
process is really like and um once you're starting to interview you
want to start figuring out what are your premium
companies like what are the places where you really
where you really want to apply and you're going to do everything we've done
so far plus you're going to start tweeting at them you're going to write a
blog post about something in their space and you're going to build a small
project something that takes you an hour to a couple hours you're going to tweak
one of our past projects to be something um that's that's kind of in the realm
that would be for that company so if it was sticky Leaf we might take our coffee
app and turn that into something else we might take our
um not the coffee app it might take like our our binary upload boom
and turn it into something that enables you to pick your favorite strands and

01:27
post your favorite strands right like you could you could modify that to be
something um that's more in line with that company
so that when they say like when you when you reach out hey like I already built
an app in this space would you take a look at it mm-hmm cool
now this is everything you need to do to like get interviews right to get folks
coming responding to your your applications to get your foot in the door
um if you do these things you will start to get interviews now once you have
interviews coming in there are some things we got to start thinking about
let me take a second I want to see if there's any questions this is like all
the groundwork you have to lay all the doors I think are worthwhile to open
before you actually start getting interviews and once you start getting
interviews there's some other things we need to think about questions

01:28
do you have any specific tips for the remote job hunt well if you look at our
last VOD we did 30 companies that were all remote the harder thing about remote
is that being local is a competitive Advantage because you're going up
against less people in a lot of cases but when you're remote the referral or
the networking your way in is way more important because you're just going up
against a lot of folks that probably don't have great applications but it's
still clogging up the works a little bit
but if you can get a referral in you can meet a real person on the team that
carries a lot of weight even especially remotely so I think for remote folks it
really comes down to the networking you're weigh-in
uh what do people you know what if you know people in companies that are next
to CEOs um can you meet them in person and they say
they can help you do you need all you need to do is like resume I don't really
understand that question uh what are good questions to ask when

01:29
they ask do you have questions for us on
the bank you can do exclamation point uh the bank and in the bank there are
questions to ask your interviewer it even links to a GitHub repo called
reverse interview questions uh that has a bunch more that you can ask during
your interviews uh what's your strategy against
companies who staff recommend you contribute to the repo to be considered
uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off uh uh versal for the 100 project it can be
like the front end if you want it to be most people are hosting their full stack
projects on either Railway render or sicklish right now sicklish right now

01:30
those are kind of like the big three um I got a recruiter call that called me
offered me an interview they just went to view a project in the interview
that's it the tech stack is not myrn uh with the 100 project be good yeah do the
app that you're most comfortable with that you sunk 100 hours into if you want
to take the weekend to add a little bit that's closer to their stack that's a
good idea like I built this app mainly in node but I added this piece that was
in Python because that's what y'all use at the company
can I expect 30 an hour of Parts unemployment it depends we had somebody
that had a full-time offer the part-time hours that was wild

01:31
would it be life warning pie torch while going through 100 devs absolutely not
have you ever decided on an alternative I haven't given my official
recommendation but it's going to come down to railway render or cyclist it's
it when everyone works for you the best folks are having good good experiences
with all three of those I'm just trying to pick one that I can use for the
future and hopefully get a deal or two in place for y'all but those are the big
three that it's coming down to cool any word on 100 maintainers we're going
to talk about that on uh Tuesday so Tuesday is our official last class lots
of thank yous and we're going to talk about the future of 100 devs and how you
can help if you want to help all right we're at the top of the hour

01:32
so when we come back we're gonna start talking about what you need to do when
you start interviewing so everything that we just talked about
is getting you to interview how do you get through your interviews what do you
need to do to play the game well how do you SL 360 slam dunk your interviews
leave them jaws of gape ready to hire a realistic time frame on getting asking
for a coffee chat to getting an offer it's different for every company some
companies some companies you'll you'll talk them
on a Monday they got an offer for you Friday some people you'll talk to them
on a on a Monday and three months later you're finally finishing up the process
it really does depend on the company and every company is completely different
hmm all right so now you got interviews coming in you're either networking your
way in or your LinkedIn is popping and recruiters are reaching out to you uh

01:33
next is what I like to call how you play the game all of this stuff is how I
think you can play the game it's up to you to determine how you want to play it
a lot of nerds get really mad with the stuff I share in this class about like
how dare you tell them to put 100 devs on their resume or there are some other
weird stuff that they're just trying to gate keep their four-year degree in the
hundreds of thousand dollars that they spent for no damn apparent reason
because you get a better job than them after a boot camp experience right and
so all this I like to say is how to play the game uh but it's
always up to you to figure out how you want to play and the things that you
want to do right the things that you want to do
to play that game it's all about the doors that you feel comfortable opening
cool I think the most important thing after your Hit List is the bank if you
did nothing but hit list right if you did nothing but hit list
and study the bank you could get a job if you've come to any of the T spills

01:34
95 of them got the job by answering questions that were on the bank it's
kind of freakishly Works um it's one of the best things I ever
introduced to my students the bank has gotten more jobs than learning anything
else literally I could probably take someone
that doesn't know how to code help them with all the stuff we talked about
tonight have them Network and learn the bank and I'm pretty sure I could get
them a job like they don't know how to code it all
I'm pretty sure I could get them a job the bank gets jobs so you can do
exclamation point bank here in the um in the chat that'll give you the link
the bank just has a bunch of questions right the bank just has a bunch of
questions honey a glad to see you name change okay

01:35
I see you thank you for the tier three 21 months at tier three that's wild
thank you so much hope you're doing well all right so the bank has a list of
Behavioral questions a bunch of technical questions and even has
um some like harder like CS Theory stuff you should probably put into your
repertoire and then the questions that you could ask your interviewer
um that come from this reverse interview list and most of these questions come
from these resources here right it's just kind of combining all the questions
into one file um but if you were to go through and
answer all of these questions you will be prepared for a significant right
significant portion of your interviews um realistically your day should be spent
hit listing and banking we call banking we put all these questions into our Inky
so if you're new around here we like to use a tool called Anki that is a spaced

01:36
repetition tool space repetition is one of the best things you can do to learn
and so what it does is like flash cards with an algorithm so you can take all
these questions put them into your Anki deck and surface the questions that you
need to see at that given time so you don't forget stuff right and so
please you do anything do your hit list all right and then do your bank
Hit List Bank all right folks it was a great stream tonight I really
enjoyed talking to you all I hope you have a great night
but I really could stop here I really could stop here hit list and
Bank hit list and Bank hit list and Bank
what should you be doing Leo what should I be doing right now as I'm going

01:37
through the hunt hit list and Bank all right put that in your Banky and do
it every day now I'm a big fan of answering all these questions yourself
in your own voice in your own words getting that active recall in right but
if you don't have time um we've linked to it on Discord
um but Curtis put together a a kind of like an open source answer list for all
these questions that could give you a good start but seriously this if you
come to any of the T spills this is what has gotten most people jobs not code
Wars not leak code not their technical ability heck not even their 100 hours
project being able to have high level conversations with their interviewers
that pretty much come off of this Bank their behavioral questions most of the
questions are coming off of this Bank right most of the questions come off of
this bank now this behavioral List have all the questions no but it gives you

01:38
right but it gives you it gives you enough things to think about so that
when you do have a question that's not on this list you at least have some
things to use to answer cool alrighty now you'll notice that the bank has
behavioral questions and those behavioral questions you want
to use a method of responding to them called car
star I ain't about star I'm about car star is an extra thing you have to
remember and when you're in the throes of interviewing remember an extra thing
doesn't work so I'm all about car s action result what happened
what action did you take and why are you the best thing since sliced bread

01:39
because of that action that you took cause action result you should have the
cause action result or car for all 21 of these questions right cause action
result these should be you should be you should somebody should be able to say
that when I was prepping this you could say the number and I could answer my
three sentences this was a couple years ago I could you could you could give me
the question I you give me the number that's how that's how in this I was
right I don't actually do stuff I haven't done myself
right I showed you my daily code Wars right and so
you could go through these and have a car a cause action result for each one

01:40
right um I think I like give me a number somebody
throw a number in chat let's see y'all went fast I gotta scroll up
cool I think uh number 14 was the first one that popped up
what's 14. uh no the 14 doesn't work I can't tell you about my experience at
100 devs the next one was oh actually the first one was 12. uh
describe a situation where you worked effectively Under Pressure uh how did it
feel working under pressure what was going on and how did you get through
at my last opportunity someone pushed the production on a Friday and it broke
we spent the weekend fixing the problem getting production

01:41
back in line and I after that experience helped the team come up with new
documentation and a new system that made sure that we never pushed to production
on a Friday ever again so going forward we never had production break because we
put better systems in place and we never had to spend the weekend fixing the
problem car what what happened we pushed production on Friday something broke
what action did I take we put a better system in place to never push on Friday
and better systems to make sure that we don't break production I'm the best
thing ever because we never had that problem again
I swear this is almost verbatim from the last time we entered this yes because I
have them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] memorized you should too
cause action result that's the point you know it but your interviewer won't
you'll just be looking chill relaxed yeah so my last opportunity you know

01:42
we uh we push the production on a Friday right like you it'll come out smooth
right it'll come out smooth because you have it memorized and you practice it
here's here's the devastating secret that you won't do
record yourself answering these problems right record yourself see your quirks
right see what you do that you shouldn't do in an interview record yourself
talking through these code up a quick random number generator
as the numbers pop up you you answer them and then you watch it back what did
you do that was cringy what did you do that you shouldn't do in the future
right but these having these behavioral questions car cause action result
lockdown will get you a job you did nothing else honestly this is
what has gotten people so many jobs it's kind of ridiculous
uh the next thing is you have a lot of technical questions the goal with these

01:43
technical questions is not to have a deep understanding it's enough
to say when somebody says hey have you heard of CSS Sprites you don't go no
right it's just to have enough understandings that you can have more
technical conversations you can talk with your interviewer right next
question you can talk with your interviewer and it comes across as an
engineer has been doing this for years right for years because you have a deep
knowledge on a lot of stuff that comes up during interviews so the bank has
what 300 technical questions that I think are really important for you to go
not 300 but a lot for you to go through that I think are really important for
you to have a cursory understanding and that cursor understanding is using a
technique I like to call EU explanation use example you should have an

01:44
explanation use an example for each of these questions right
CSS price are similar to doors well let's see the CSS uh Sprite ones on the
list explain CSS Sprites right so if you're ever trying to speed up your
page one of the things you can do to reduce the number of network requests is
to use a CSS Sprite a CSS Sprite is a way of putting all of your images
into one image file and then using CSS or some other tool to move around that
image so only what you care about is in view so you can go from lots of network
requests to a singular Network request and a good example of this is Amazon if
you go to Amazon's page they really care about page load speed they've actually
said that for every one second their page load speed increases they lose a
million dollars a day so all the logos the swoops all that stuff is actually

01:45
one image file that is a CSS Sprite explanation what it was use you use it
to speed up your site by making only one network request instead of a lot and an
example the Amazon example you want to have EU for each of these questions
explanation use example and then you add them to your Anki so
you don't forget them this is a metric crap ton of work 100 hours easily
but it's what gets jobs now you're starting to see the magic right you're
starting to see uh the magic of this uh this random person sitting in space with
their cats right it's not Magic you're doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that other people
won't do during the job hunt I can guarantee you those dirty clickers are not

01:46
building out a beautiful portfolio a manicured GitHub a a perfect LinkedIn I
guarantee you they're not networking their way oh no that's too spicy even my
computer can't handle it they're they're not networking their way my computer my
camera just got too hot they're not networking their way
right they don't want you to know this they don't want you to know this
information they literally don't want you to know
this information this is too they they they're trying to shut me down I'm not
gonna let it happen the clickers will not get me
it's not gonna happen it's not it can't they need to know this they're coming
for me I won't be silenced I won't be silenced I refuse

01:47
they're not building their githubs they're not networking their way into
applications they're not spending a hundred hours building a project
they're not doing hundreds of hours of Banky when they go into these interviews
like Scrubs all their weakness shows but we're a hundred devs we don't go
into our interviews like an accident we go in prepared lean mean interviewing
machines we come we eat their lunch we take their money we take their jobs
they tried to keep me down they tried to keep me out they said Leon
was given the secrets away not today I'm back can't keep me

01:48
off these Airways folks the clickers came they got got all right
refresh refresh tell spam refresh and chat please the folks know that they um
indifferent hey love you too brother all right next
technical coding challenge you've you've you've done your Hit List you've
networked your way in you've prepared the bank the last thing you need
is to be prepared for a technical coding challenge as well right

01:49
okay this is this is live live footage of my computer uh my computer just gets
gets this like I have like this um sound dampening curtain I guess
um but it just makes the room overheat and then my my camera doesn't like it
all right so the last part here people realize that they could redeem
um Channel Point stuff again because the stream restarted y'all slick I love it
get yours get in here I love it that's smart as hell they big brained it they
big brained it you smart love it a bunch of people did it

01:50
that's smart well done well done all right so we have the prep we've we've done
everything to get the interviews we've made it through our behavioral
interviews we've gotten to the Nerds once we get to the Nerds we have to have
a system to get through our technical interviews and the system I like to
implore is called prep parameters returns examples pseudo code it's
something that you step through with every technical challenge that you do
if you want to practice prep we are doing it every single day
together we have five six hundred people turning up every single day to practice
through prep uh 6 p.m Eastern time come through we put the the question in the
hunt Tober daily channel the day before sometimes the same day if I'm running a
little behind and then we work through it together and then we ask about a
bunch of questions so definitely come through if you want to practice prep

01:51
um but I want to show quickly uh prep real quick uh let's just open up
a wraplet this is the problem we worked on today during class
um let's do a different one let's just do let's do
I'm gonna do a node template here also a word of advice whenever you show up to
an interview always know what you're going into what type of interview should
I expect is it behavioral is it technical what questions am I going to
be asked right and if you know they're gonna be doing a technical challenge
have your replet pulled up or whatever you feel comfortable with all right
so let's say the interviewer gives us a question that says Hey I want you to

01:52
take in a word and I want you to return whether or not that word is a palindrome
right is that word a palindrome and so once
you've given that word one of the things you might want to do is like oh thank
you for the question do you mind if I take notes
yes you may take notes okay so you're asking for you're gonna be giving me a
word and you're going to tell me whether or not that word is a palindrome all
right so I have a few questions I'm going to start working through my prep
the first thing I'm going to work through is my parameters now don't do
this don't type out p but don't let them know that you have a
system that you are using right you keep that in your brain all right you said
I'm taking in a word uh will I always be taking in a word will there ever be an
instance where you don't give me the word wonderful now will this word be
only made up of actual letters like well always only be a string okay it will

01:53
only be a string wonderful so I know I'm taking in a string we know that it will
only ever be letters and will these letters ever have any special characters
right will these letters ever have any special characters will they ever have
any um anything that's not a traditional letter
or word we have to worry about spaces or
anything like that no so no no spaces no special characters no funny business
right no funny business no accents that's a good one uh do I have to worry
about capitalization can I just assume that all the words will be lowercase
great so it's regular letters uh all lower case uh no special characters and
no uh no funny business wonderful now what I am returning to you is whether or
not it's a palindrome this is the returns the r in our prep we don't type
R all right I'm going to return to you a a whether or not it's a palindrome

01:54
would you like that as a string saying yes or no would you like that as a
Boolean as true or false what would you like me to do to let you know that it is
in is indeed or not a palindrome oh you want a Boolean to be returned so we're
going to return uh true or false whether
or not it's a palindrome wonderful uh do you mind if we work through some
examples together I'm just going to set up a function here
I'm going to call this is palindrome and uh real quick before we work through
some examples just to make sure we're both on the same page when you say the
word palindrome you mean a word that a word that is spelled the same four words
and backwards is that correct right what you're trying to do is make sure that
you're on the same page don't leave anything up to guess when you're working
through your parameters and your returns you want it all on the table make sure
you understand exactly what they're asking you're taking that time to really
understand the problem really make sure you know what's coming in make sure
what's going out cool all right so I know I'm taking in a word
we're going to put word in here as the parameter and I was going to go ahead

01:55
and set up some test cases here uh so I'm just going to do a console log
so we can run this down the line and I'm going to put the is palindrome in here
wonderful and let's do an example I know that race car right race car
is a palindrome right it is the same four words as it is backwards
r-a-c-e-c-a-r-r-a-c-e-c-a-r so race car is a palindrome wonderful
what I would do here is I would also want to say that this is true so we
should see true true in the console if the function that we wrote is palindrome
is a palindrome we should see true true in the console let's go ahead and do

01:56
another example let's go ahead and do my alleged name
all right Leon Noel that should be true and then we can do another name
SpongeBob cool all right so race car should be
true the unwell should be true SpongeBob
should be not be true it should be false uh interviewer if all of these are
correct would we be satisfied in knowing that we have solved the problem yes now
we're doing this one to make sure we understand the problem a lot of times
when I'm doing a technical interview uh I don't really know what I'm going to do
until I'm working through the examples and then the other thing that's really
important is that we exactly we have our
receipts right we have our receipts they can't change the game on US 30 minutes

01:57
into the interview and be like actually this is what I wanted you to do uh
slow your roll you agreed that if these all work we solved the problem so not
only is it helping you figure out what you need to do what is giving you
receipts for later on too unless in case they try to switch things up the last
thing the last p and prep is our pseudo code so some things I know that I'm
going to do is I'm taking in the word I would love to reverse that word but to
reverse that word I know I'm going to need to use the I'm going to use the
reverse method I don't want to use like a for Loop or anything like that we have
some methods built into JavaScript that would make this a little bit easier to
solve but I know reverse is an array and so I need to take the string and
turn it into an array with split then I can reverse it and then I need to join
it back together so that I can compare the reverse to the actual um word
all right and that result of the reverse being equal to the other word would be

01:58
true or false cool wonderful all right so a lot of folks feel like
a lot of folks feel like this is taking a lot of time it should take a lot of
time this prep process should take at least 15 minutes to work through right
all right should take at least 15 minutes because remember I told you that
when you're talking to the Nerds you're in a technical interview it cares about
right it cares about can you code right can you code
and do I want to work with you for the next two years
so when you bring up is a two-pointer approach more efficient you may have
solved the coding part but I don't want to work with you for the next two years

01:59
so you still fail the interview believe it or not right and So
eventually you build up to more Optimal Solutions and if you want
to work up to more Optimal Solutions you should join our stand-up because every
day we're working towards getting to more Optimal Solutions but before we
solve it with the methods your methods and a Brute Force solution is all you
need right it's all you need your brute force and your methods is all
you need to get a job more Optimal Solutions are for the code weenies the
elite code sources does it open some more doors yes but out
of the hundreds of jobs that folks are getting at entry-level roles prep
methods and brute force was pretty much all they needed could you open up more

02:00
doors with more leak code yeah but you don't need it cool
let's take a look at this at the end so we could go ahead and say all right
so uh do you agree that this is on the right track uh is there anything here
that you see but that might not get me to my solution okay wonderful so I can
go ahead and split reverse Joy I'm going
to mess up a variable called uh reversed I'm just going to say rev word just
because we're live and having some fun ah we'll do it real
reversed word and we're just going to take in our word we're going to split it
now splitter takes in a separator we're going to say empty quotes because we
don't want us we don't want to have like spaces or anything like that we're just
splitting each word then we're going to reverse it
and we're going to join it back together beautiful we have to put the the
separator in there as well all right so now we have this word that has been
turned into an array reversed and then turned back into a string and all we

02:01
have to do now is return whether or not reversed word equals word
right this will give us the true or false that we're looking for so let's go
ahead and run our test cases and see what we got cooking here
all right we see true true true false false so it looks like our code is
working bomb does this meet your your status does it mean does this meet your
satisfaction did we solve the problem to your your satisfaction here yes we did
wonderful thank you so much Bob for the interview now before we wrap up I'm
curious Bob is this something that you would have in your code base on the job
at company X would you prefer to like leave comments
and have variables or do you lead or do you kind of like like to have things
maybe like on one line do you use es6 which should This Be an Arrow function
oh it should be so let's go ahead and and uh

02:02
comment this out let's go ahead and do const is palindrome or palindrome
I said palindrome not palindrome gripsies all right is palindrome and
we're gonna go and set this equal we know we're bringing in a word and we're
going to set this equal and then we can just kind of use this implicit return
and we can just say um does word equal word dot split reverse join
all right Bob so this looks like a nice one liner using all the latest and
greatest es6 syntax we see that still works true true false false wonderful
now this whole process should have taken around 30 minutes
maybe more to prep to work through the whole time you notice I didn't shut up I

02:03
kept talking ideally I'm engaging the interviewer
right we're engaging the interviewer right we're getting them talking we're
getting them answering the questions we're getting them saying yes as as
early as possible because we're trying to win the game where they at the end
like us and say that they they recommend that we be hired
you have to build a rapport with your interviewers a lot of times with
questions that are way more difficult than this you're going to get stuck if
you've been building this Rapport you've
been talking this whole time asking them
questions prep return parameters returns examples pseudocode you've been talking
through this entire piece they're gonna give you hints they're going to help you
but if you spent the whole time doing this I don't carry the five of them
and then you get stuck they're not going to help you you might as pack up your

02:04
laptop and go home they're not going to help you and so this idea of prep gives
you time to work through the problem it gets you communicating with your
interviewer it helps you build that Rapport so that they will actually help
you it also Burns a lot of time so in the end you could say you know what I'm
sorry so much I have an interview immediately following this I feel like
we can get maybe a slightly more optimal solution to this problem maybe not this
one but in real life I feel like we can get to a more optimal solution if we had
more time I might use this type of pattern uh do you mind if I follow by
email just with the optimal solution later today right then as soon as they
say yeah you go home you immediately Google how to do the more optimal
solution you send them the more optimal solution via the email thanking them for
their time tell them that you had a wonderful experience interviewing them
you provide some value that came picked up you you saw that they had a Pokemon

02:05
on their desk you say I hope you're excited for scarlet and violet that
comes out on the 18th right you throw that into the thank you you send the
optimal solution right and you get the job
so this is a process that you should be doing for every single interview every
single time you do a coding challenge you should be prepping parameters
returns examples pseudo code parameters returns examples pseudocode you do a
code Wars parameters returns examples you delete good problems return the
simple pseudocode you do the hunt Tober daily stand-up parameters returns
examples pseudocode so by the time that you are on the job Sorry by the time
you're in the interview right by the time you're in the interview
it comes out like butter what did they say actually I'm not too
busy I have time sorry I actually have another interview with another company

02:06
right now uh I really appreciate the time you gave me today I will definitely
follow up by email though have a great rest of your day
there's a game to be played folks it's up to you if you want to play it
I scratched them onto zeros on the hard disk with the needle myself oh yeah
oh I like that atrocity I don't be disrespectful with the other company I
have an interview with cool if you you prep
you know your method's cold we've been spending like a past week or two just
making sure we knew all of our methods uh today we saw sorting methods we saw

02:07
Char code app methods we tried to see slice methods but we ran out of time um we
have seen split reverse we've seen all these
methods that I've asked you to practice and we're seeing them live and stand up
so if you need to practice what your methods come to stand up we're getting
that practice in but if you know how to prep you know your methods you know how
to brute force a solution which is like the non-optimal solution
that's all you need that's it you get a job you can stop
right there you don't need to know how to do the Optimal Solutions to lead codes
Etc does it help yes does it open more doors yes but it sprinkles it sprinkles
it sprinkles on top of your interviewing Sunday

02:08
don't listen to me I'm just a random guy on the internet drinking some tea
how about Sean on Discord they wrote this there was no technical assessment
I just told them about the projects I had worked on and made sure I was
friendly remember number two and connected with them as people I know
there are lots of people here that are better coders than me so it's absolutely
possible you can do this Don't Stop Believing stay consistent it will happen
winners win losers lose stay consistent find a way to win
no technical assessment amazing job Erica the nerves got to them
right the nerves got to them I was going to cancel the interview but my friend
convinced me in the last minute they now work part-time but get paid full time

02:09
part-time work for full-time pay the nerves almost stopped them from going to
an interview you know enough you are ready Daddy Yankee build the button
with HTML and CSS and got an 83k job that's now they've
gotten a raise and it's even worth even more now a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] button
and if you go in our celebrations Channel you will see that this is not a
fluke this is not something that they got lucky with you will see 50 plus
examples of folks that got amazing jobs without technical coding challenges

02:10
hey Rose oh that's cool hope they're doing well a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fighting
you can code a button all right so just do it just do it
so just do it make your dreams come true just do it
maybe Shia LaBeouf will convince you to do it you're ready you're ready you
don't need anything else but if you want some sprinkles you want some sprinkles
I got some sprinkles for you folks that's the day of structures and algorithms
we did a very simple inter a very simple introduction
right a very simple introduction and that's really all you need

02:11
when you start talking about optimizations that you would make
that's all it is you might not be coming up with these really Optimal Solutions
in your in your in your interviews but if you play your
prep right you manage your time well you can at least talk through why something
might not be optimal and strategies you might take to make it more optimal
without having to actually solve the optimal solution now if you're applying
to if you're one of those people that like want to work at Fang or something
look uh those folks this they they need all the sprinkles they need the
sprinkles they need the whipped cream they need the Cherry but for most of the
jobs that we're going for these sprinkles are meaningless knowing the
optimizations knowing how to evaluate your code
in terms of space and time is enough we have a full class on this so you can go
back actually two classes right you can go back to those two

02:12
classes and see all of this in detail but very quickly right very quickly
uh when we talk about data structures and algorithms I think it's just the
last thing you need the last sprinkle you need if you want to interview well
right the last thing you need if you want to interview well and that last
thing is to understand what data structure algorithms are an algorithm is
just the steps you take to solve a problem all right oh no my little one's not
doing too well I'll be right back one second we're back
God family academics always always um it's close to little one's bedtime
and I think they're trying to hit it a little early all right

02:13
so these are sprinkles right the sprinkles that we're putting on our interview
Sunday [Laughter] right our interview Sunday and so let's
just run through these quickly but know that we have two classes on all of this
right algorithms I already hear somebody talk
about algorithms it's just the steps you take to solve a problem
and it's helpful to know how to evaluate the efficiency of those
steps that you are taking and we say the efficiency we care about two things
space and time how much time theoretically are we
taking and how much space theoretically are we taking up in memory
and space being how much memory is used time how many operations are executed
per input now when I say about time I don't really mean like the actual amount
of seconds something takes we're talking about rough estimates right rough
estimates when I'm evaluating time of an

02:14
algorithm or the steps I took to solve a problem why do I care about rough
estimates and not about like the actual numbers or the number of seconds it took
for my code or the solution that I've written uh to run
a recipe is an algorithm exactly thank you indifferent this is the steps you
took to solve the problem because it differs exactly the code that
runs on my Beast of a PC that's overheating my room will probably run my
function faster than my Chromebook right so I don't care about the actual
second something takes I take about I talk about the rough theoretical
overview so how many operations are executed per input is what I really
really care about and we have a way of talking about this

02:15
rough estimate and what we use to talk about this rough estimate is something
called Big O notation uh Big O notation like why do we use it it's just a way of
mathematically describing how complex an
algorithm or the steps you took to solve a problem is in terms of that time and
space but why why do we use Big O why do we
use this mathematical notation well it's like I said the environment in which we
run our code whether it's a beast of a PC or Chromebook would actually make
certain code run faster or slower we don't care about that when we're trying
to evaluate the steps that our algorithm taking we're trying to get a rough
estimate of how many operations per input we are taking it's theoretical not
exact cool so some common complexities you're going to run into
you're going to see our constant time our logarithmic our

02:16
linear and our quadratic or ones you typically start off with
constant time means that for any number of inputs there will only ever be one
operation right no matter how many inputs there are there will only ever be one
operation we can see this one accessing an element out of an array
right so if I want the first element out of this array no matter how many inputs
I have in my array accessing an element out of that input will happen in
constant time no matter how many more values I add to my array it will always
just be one operation right now the inputs if we had an equal number of
inputs and an equal number of operations
right so for each input we also have one

02:17
operation we would call that linear or o of n
and an example of a linear complexity is when we Loop through that array
right so here we're going to Loop through and sum all the numbers that are
inside of this array so for this for Loop to run we're going to take each
number and add it to our sum so for each input there is one operation
right so this for Loop would run grabbing one adding it to some to adding
it to some three adding it to some or adding to some five adding it to some
so for each input there was an equal operation
all right now the thing that blew my mind the thing that absolutely blew my mind
is this gauss's sum this should be an a here was this gauss's sum

02:18
with gauss's sum I was able to sum an array just by taking the last value
so here I'm grabbing the last element out of my array and I'm doing this fancy
right right it will do this fancy math trick
right we do this fancy math trick right we do this fancy math trick and we do
this fancy math trick we get the sum so if you ever have a continuous array
of numbers meaning that they go from one to the number they don't skip anything
they're in order right you can go ahead and just grab the last
number so no matter how many inputs you're doing one operation and you get
the sum you don't need to Loop through right you don't need to Loop through you

02:19
can do one operation and get the sum that turns something that was a linear
complexity into something that is constant time this is why people study
data structures in algorithms there will be problems that come up often in
computer science and in engineering that
if you know the tricks you can do it way more efficiently imagine we had a
million numbers we'd have to Loop through each number to get the sum but
if you knew this trick you do one operation no Loop and you get the same value
right that is the power of data structure algorithms and that's why people study
them do they come up in a normal Engineers day-to-day no
maybe depending on what you're working on but when it does show up oh boy oh boy
right oh boy does it does it pop off and so what we're doing during the daily

02:20
stand-ups right we're doing during the daily stand-ups is is slowly exposing
you to the really common data structures and the Really common algorithms that
might show up in your interview but none of this is necessary this is all
sprinkles on top if you know your prep you know how your methods like your
JavaScript methods your your sorts your Maps your reduces your filters and you
know how to Brute Force just like using regular functions Loops right that's
good enough learning this stuff puts you over the edge so I share it so far two
resources the scotch io's introduction to algorithms and then a free front-end
Masters course on introductions to algorithms you do those two courses you
know enough to blaze through your interviews at most companies that's like
taking it to the next level putting all those sprinkles on top

02:21
right so that's kind of the idea why these things are important uh there's
two more quadratic uh when you see like a loop inside of a loop for each input
you're also doing an operation as you add more inputs you're doing X well not
exponentially but close to exponentially more operations that would be quadratic
we have something called logarithmic where we have special algorithms we can
break our inputs in half throw away the ones we don't care about and it's a
little bit faster and then we have a whole class on this right so if you know
that you want to add the sprinkles on top go check out our past VOD
um our past class on data structures and
algorithms it'll cover all this stuff in
detail if you're watching this on how to interview definitely go back and watch
that class this is just trying to give you a little taste as to why it might be
important
