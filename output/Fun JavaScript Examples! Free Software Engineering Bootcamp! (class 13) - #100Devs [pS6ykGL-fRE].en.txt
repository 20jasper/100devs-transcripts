00:00
yeah oh oh it keeps going hey good morning good afternoon good evening
we're coming from hope you all are doing well welcome back folks
we're back for day two in that js up again hope you all are doing well
welcome back welcome back welcome back get in here get in here ah
tonight's a night i love tonight tonight we get to build more stuff we
get to play around with some new things and so it'll be a lot of fun lots of

00:01
practice lots of examples super excited for you to come back for javascript
class two class two folks we've only had one class of javascript
so far this is class two welcome back everybody hey
what's going on get in get in get in get in
alrighty so we're jumping right into it tonight we got a lot of cool stuff to
get into uh you always know we like to start off with questions i'm going to
start off with questions this evening then we're going to get into it
global crisis hey thank you for the five gifted subs that's such a good name
starting off with a global crisis i appreciate it thank you so much
deep fried penguin hey thank you for if i get the subs as well oh yo y'all
popping off hey welcome in everybody hope y'all doing well uh
for those that are new or might just be joining us for the first time welcome

00:02
i'm leon we're running a free 30-week software engineering bootcamp going from
zero to employed we're doing good do we get spring break
we'll talk about it so last cohort um last cohort we had the holidays in
between and so we started a little bit later right we started a little bit
later so we'll probably have some sort of break coming up but we haven't said
anything in stone yet just a little bit more time for you to work on projects so
once we get a little bit deeper into javascript and we're feeling good a
little bit of time to like actually build something more substantial hey
all right you know like we like to do we
always start off with some questions the question of the day
is what did you do for yourself this weekend part of your homework was to do
something good for yourself kind for yourself nice for yourself what you all do
taco bell ate waffles i love it all these are food related all right garden

00:03
went to vegas what new coffee maker okay hate dominoes hey let's go turn up
i need i need like a i need like an air horn i don't i can't believe i don't
have this but somebody went to domino's [Music] all right cool
got some new games we're playing on the on the playstations made some muffins
napped i'll take it miriam the that hey thank you for the
five get themselves hope you're doing well i hope you're feeling better

00:04
welcome back pokemon no code and all caps cool i love it took the day off
okay went shopping saw granny hey turn up played a disc golf tourney i watch an
unhealthy amount of disc golf on youtube
i've never played disc golf in my life i
just like watching it on youtube i don't know why i think that's a little weird
but i've watched a lot of it nespresso machine okay living good life
alright folks you actually did some stuff i asked y'all to do something nice for
yourself and it looks like we might have actually done some nice things for our
stuff i love it lasik that's awesome hope you hope you're doing well
hopefully don't stare at the screens too much
can you do that can you get lasik and then like next day be here like staring
at a screen for three hours be careful be don't stress your eyes out you can
always you can always join the ketchup crew for a day catch the vod on uh here
on twitch or of course i always upload the videos to youtube

00:05
you got a job hey world you did get a job shout out to you i gotta i i got to
put your uh your message in the slides i'll get get you on thursday
congrats that's huge so happy for you alrighty folks
you got a lot of questions in i'm glad y'all are here
glad day one of javascript didn't scare you back you came back right you came
back you're ready to get some so let's get some tonight all right tonight
we don't get we are we are talking about imposter syndrome
it's something that most of you are going to experience it's something
that's going to sit deep within you for a while and so i want to make sure we
talk about it from the beginning so we're going to start off with imposter
syndrome we're going to talk about the basics of
programming we're going to cover the basics of javascript that we covered
last class so if last class variables didn't work for

00:06
you if conditionals didn't work for you don't worry we're going over all that
stuff again we're going to look at the two things from the end of class that we
didn't get a chance to get to the angry parent simulator and the
temperature converter so we're going to start off with those then we're going to
spend some time talking and going deeper
with our pseudo code getting a chance to talk through
the temperature converter not with code but with this idea of a skill that's
going to help us for the rest of our careers and help us write really good
code going forward we're going to learn about functions
we're going to add on to the big four remember i said the big four are
variables conditionals functions and loops well guess what we're adding
functions into the mix we got variables and a little bit of conditionals last
time so we're going to see those the the next one of the big four and then we're
going to talk through some of the homework so a lot to get into tonight a
lot of fun stuff i love this i love this point in the boot camp
i love this point in the bootcamp because we can actually start to build

00:07
real stuff so we're gonna we're gonna keep that playful spirit tonight we're
gonna build we're gonna see stuff from different angles we're gonna start
getting you more comfortable with the syntax and we're gonna take it easy and
work our way into javascript so i'm glad you're here glad you're ready to carry
some boats and logs ready to put in some work so let's get to it all right
if you have not checked in please do so you can always do exclamation point
check in here in chat or if you're just following me on twitter you can just
retweet the tweet and like it please or always in the
following materials or the go live message so i know check it's full with
the check in which i love to see um but know that you can always just kind of do
it early if you want to as well alrighty so go ahead and check in uh this is my
my magnus magnus opus my my the the culmination of
years of hard work uh this is uh this is a long time coming it's

00:08
something i've worked very very hard for and uh when i was on twitter
and i was i was looking on the right hand side where it shows you the
relevant folks we did it we really did that thing folks look at
us go we got the relevant people yourself yes sir and a domino's pizza
together so thank you for checking in and making my dreams come true
this wouldn't have happened without you cool submitting homework so
uh i asked you last class to take what we did and play with it
right take what you did and like we did together and break it
add to it make it different make it your own play with it so if you did that
right if you did it if you didn't it's okay if you did that i would love to see
what you built right a lot of people have been throwing on
twitter i love it throw it on twitter at me i would love to see the things you

00:09
build coming out of this class right so for folks that worked on it played with
it broke it rebuilt it right right what is this me this mean this is your
last time streaming yeah we've peaked this is it this is peak right here folks
you're seeing it live for those that broke it played with it
built it i would love to see what you did throw it in a co-pen for me all
right throw it in a coat pen for me show me the
at least the the extra numbers you added show me the um
extra bits and bobs that i asked you the extra color right and if you took it
even further than that i love to see it so go ahead throw the code that you did
into a codepen and submit the url for me cool
now some folks have been sharing the things that they did
between now and last class and it's been amazing
uh is glitch okay of course glitch is okay replace okay whatever those works
we just take them down if we pick one so

00:10
whatever you want to use is fine with me uh cuzzy
thank you for the hydration cheers to you got a lovely uh hot coffee today
all right yeah so some folks have been sharing
what they did on twitter and i just want to show some of those i think they're
really cool uh so let's start this one here uh this
is a mario kart version of the background picker uh you can go ahead
and kind of select the different characters and they show up that's wild
i love it another one i saw was the uh weather changer so you could
change the weather from sunny to rainy uh to windy to snowy which is pretty dope
right so taking the youtube background picker and making it your own
uh there was a mortal kombat one as well yeah mortal kombat one as well which is

00:11
pretty neat i'm going to share all the links i'm gonna share all the links on uh
discord afterwards and so go ahead and like these for me folks i've retweeted
most of them but go ahead and like them too it's really cool to see what people
are building so this is this was the mortal kombat one
uh this was a nail polish picker which was really cool i love it you picked the
different nail polishes and the nail changes
and then this other one was pick your favorite uh starters
right from pokemon so i thought these were pretty dope and so that's what i
want to see folks right when i when i say hey take the homework right
take the homework and make it your own right make it your own play with it
break it change things tweak it that's what i'm saying make your own the way
that you learn how to code is by doing right a lot of folks we we saw that code
for the first time right the the truth is you didn't need
to understand anything that was happening in that code base to add

00:12
another smurf or to add another event listener you had you didn't need to know
anything that was happening in that code to
to make one more thing happen right i don't care if you knew the syntax it's
just playing with legos so in the beginning you got to write some bad code
right you got to be a bad you got to write some bad code and treat it like
lego blocks see how things come together break stuff make it a little bit more
than what you have right and so as we start getting into the homework that's
what i'm looking for this idea where you're going to take it make it your own
because there's a lot of you here right there's a lot of you here and what we
don't want in the end are thousands of portfolios that look the same
right we don't want thousands of portfolios that look the same and so make sure
right make sure you're making them your own pick something you're excited about
something you're passionate about something that is just cool to you

00:13
and infuse those into the projects that you do if you do that you're gonna have
a way more personal portfolio and you're
gonna have some things to help you stand out against others
where can we find assets like those that's my biggest hurdle
i'm sure most folks are just using google like google images um
yeah it's a fine line when you're doing stuff but if it's not for commercial use
you're you're not probably going to get gap but i'm not a lawyer don't take this
advice at all yeah there are other sites that have
gifts too like giphy is a really popular one gift cat stuff like that
the cool things too is on google images you can actually do a google image
search and then there's like a setting that says like like copyright free
right copyright free and like you can find more resources like that too
but yeah have some fun with it alrighty so thank you for submitting your work
i want to talk about something really important tonight

00:14
uh and the thing i want to talk about is imposter syndrome now i just showed
a bunch of really cool examples of folks that took the homework
and made it their own right and when i do this there are some people
that immediately start to panic right they start to freak out
and they start to say wait a minute are these people further along than me
are these people do they know more than i know is is all
the stuff that i know invalid or did i did i did i even was even there last
class right and so this idea of imposter syndrome shows up
in a lot of different ways it can be when you're looking around at
others and you feel a little bit worse about the things that you're doing uh it
shows up a lot when you're maybe on the job and you go do i
really know the stuff that i that i claim to know or when you get assigned a
really hard project and it doesn't doesn't really go your way like wait did

00:15
i just do this for all this amount of time right there there's these like
feelings that come up this this this like this thing in the back of your
brain telling you that you're not good enough
or that you can't do the things that you think you can do
and the really hard thing to tell you is that for a lot of folks it never goes
away it just doesn't so you learn how to kind
of deal with it and to adjust a little bit for me i still have it i i i
in my brain there's something that tells
me i don't know how to code i don't know what it is but there's something in my
brain that tells me that i don't notice it i know i know how to code right i
i've built amazing projects for lots of amazing clients like i i teach like i've
helped hundreds thousands of people learn how to code right i know i know
how to code but there's something in my brain that tells me i don't that this is
all this is all a scam this is all uh uh uh uh like a uh

00:16
a facade and the the green screen's gonna come crashing down and people are
gonna figure out that i don't know how to code and it's all gonna be over right
i don't know how to get that feeling out of my brain and if i have it
i know a lot of you have it too
because i've been doing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for 10 years all right
and so i really need you to know that you're that you're not alone
when you start to feel these things or or start to heal the hear these
thoughts in your brain right imposter syndrome is very real and
it's something that affects a lot of people specifically in tech
right because when you're learning to code people think that and it's not true
people think that if you know how to code more or better that you tie it to
like your intelligence you tie it to like your smarts right smart people can

00:17
code that's all cap it's just not real like like like yes it probably helps but
it's it's it's learning lego blocks and how they come together effectively right
i wouldn't look at some kid building legos and go wow they're way smarter
than me because they can put legos together it's not it's not it's just
it's just they spent more time with it they had different privileges going into
it and you can't let these things weigh on you right
because it'll stop you from getting what you want
and so we we've we've used this example of being on a roller coaster
right we're all beyonce on a roller coaster right and we're going down the
hill like we're we're going down the hill we're almost ready to crash into
the trough of star like we're on the bottom right we're on one roller coaster
we're all flying down and some of us are on this roller coaster looking at the
person three or four carts ahead of us and going

00:18
how how are they ahead of us on this roller coaster right like how how are
they three or four carts further down into the trough of sorrow
and it just doesn't make sense we're all on the same roller coaster
together right some folks got here a little bit earlier right
some folks paid for the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fastpass
right but we're still all on the same roller coaster we're all gonna get to
the same place eventually you can't be mad that there's a person three or four
carts ahead of you and going damn i'll never get there you're hurtling into the
abyss and you're mad that somebody's gonna get there a couple classes before you
it just doesn't make sense we're all on the same roller coaster
we're all going to get there eventually you can't be looking
at the person three or four cards ahead of you going damn how are they doing it
they're not doing anything they're just on the same freaking roller coaster you

00:19
are they got there half an hour earlier so what i need you to do
as you're going through right as you're going through this
experience don't look at the person a few cards ahead of you on the roller
coaster it makes no sense look at yourself where were you different a class ago
where were you different a week ago where were you different a month ago
and where are you going to be a year from now that's what you need to focus on
not not where somebody else is on the roller coaster that makes no sense but
you got to look at yourself where am i at on the roller coaster am i being my
best beyonce possible am i enjoying the ride or am i the
person that's like in line mad that somebody bought the fastpass right

00:20
so tonight uh i want to do something that if you watch the video
right if you watch the video uh dr thomas has a saying in there that says i
don't care about your reality i want you to dream
all right he said i don't care about your reality i want you to dream tonight
i don't care about your reality i want you to leave your reality at the door
right i don't care about that tonight tonight i want you to dream so
i don't care about the pain of last class i don't care how much you struggle
to understand the syntax i don't care how inflamed your imposter syndrome is
right now because you saw some other projects and you're mad at somebody
that's a few cards ahead of you on the roller coaster
uh i don't want any of that you're gonna leave all that at the door tonight and
we're gonna dream a little bit all right we're gonna dream a little bit
tonight and so tonight if you didn't finish the js from last
class you leave that at the door if you didn't finish your homework you

00:21
leave that at the door uh any of those feelings
of saying i'm not ready i can't do this i don't understand that's your reality i
don't want that tonight you leave that at the door so when i click this next
slide we leave our reality at the door we're opening up the idea that we're
going to dream together we're going to play together we're going to break stuff
together we're going to have fun and when i go to this next slide that
reality slips away and we're here to learn some javascript you ready
aye aye captain boom alrighty golden rule separation of concerns we're
gonna leave the content in our html we're going to leave the style in our
css and that behavior and interaction goes into our javascript why why

00:22
why do we need this yeah organization exactly
our code is getting a little bit more complex now
marty cats hey thank you for the five gifts that subs i appreciate you thank
you for being here right our codes get a little more complicated now
we're going to have bigger files we're going to have bigger things we have to
keep track of we're manipulating the dom and all that
cool stuff and we need to keep ourself organized for ourselves and our team so
this golden rule helps us stay organized beautiful
we saw ideas in classes when we were learning html and css but last class
when we first dipped our toes into the javascript pool we saw that ids can be
really helpful now right they saw that they could be really
helpful now when we put an id on something this enables us to target it
with our javascript right i i don't really use right i don't really use ids when

00:23
i'm writing my html or css but when it comes to javascript i can latch on to
those ids to target that element so that i can listen for clicks so i can do
stuff to it so i can put stuff in it take stuff out of it right and so these
ideas are going to become really helpful for us when we are in javascript same
thing for classes remember ids you can only target one element classes you can
target multiple elements right and yes you can target a class you can target
all the things with the class at the same time i think we'll actually see
that in one of the examples tonight right so you can target classes you can
target um really cool stuff that just aren't the
ids and so you're going to see them come a little bit more when it comes to our
javascript the cool thing about being able to
target classes since you asked is that you can bind
smurfs to a lot of stuff at one time so what if you want like the same smurf
on a bunch of different stuff right well there's a way right

00:24
right there's a way that we can loop through everything that has a class
and put a smurf on it right so we're not at loops yet but there's a way where we
can loop through and put a smurf on every single thing and so by using that
class we can listen for similar types of clicks pretty neat cool
talk about programming and we're going to talk about programming tonight
right programming comes down to one very simple thing
a computer will do what you tell it to do right that's it
a computer will do what you tell it to do now it'll do it a lot faster
it'll do it a lot quicker than we could probably do it on our own but it'll do
what we tell it to do now a program is simply a set of
instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do right so

00:25
last class we all wrote programs our programs were simple sets of
instructions and those instructions told our computer what to do we were
able to change background colors we were able to do things
based off of the instructions that we wrote right and so that leads us to the
idea of programming programming is simply writing those
instructions in a language that the computer can understand
why why why am i saying in a language that the computer can understand why do
i bring that up writing is instructions in a language a
computer can understand what is why do i say that yeah
i love it people like javascript is for humans exactly
javascript is for humans right javascript is the language that we're

00:26
writing so that we understand what's happening in our code right so that when
we hand it off to another developer they
understand what's happening in that code right but
our computers really don't understand javascript that javascript has to be
broken down into something that the computer can actually really understand
right and so we talked about independence day and we
talked about independence day being a true story
right a true story why is independence day a true story
we have a saying around these parts why is independence day a true story
bub exactly yeah binary upload boom in independence day jeff goldblum saves
the world by running a computer virus that infects the alien mothership the

00:27
shields go down on all the other ships we nuke the crap out of those ships save
the world america right and so it's a true story because that's
actually what would happen jeff goldblum
didn't understand the alien language but they were able to break that alien
language all the way down into simple logic
maybe all the way down to the binary the equivalence of on and off right we hope
that even if aliens are far far out in the world right that physics is
universal math is universal the idea of on and off is universal so we can take
anything and break it down further and further
closer to the code that the machine or the computer can actually understand and
then build our way back up right so independence day is a true story because
we would be able to take that alien language break it all the way down to
something the computer could understand and bring it all the way back up we call

00:28
that binary upload boom now since we're talking about this
higher level language this javascript that's meant for us to be human readable
and some of you are like leon it didn't look human readable to me
trust me it could get way worse did anybody watch the the game boy video
anybody watch that game boy video yeah it gets wild right so i shared that video
so you could see the stuff that we don't have to do like we don't we're not nope
next you cut that ain't for me i'm not about to get in there
and do that kind of stuff it was cool but i i i'll i'll keep my ad event
listener i'll keep my uh my document i'll i'll i'll keep my dot value right
because that's a little wild and so javascript
is a human readable languages so that we

00:29
can read and understand and then it gets broken down into the that like really
wild stuff that was in that that video right now
javascript has a specific syntax right there's gonna be lots of new words
terms punctuations odd stuff that at first glance might cause you to
have a panic attack and i don't say that lightly i really do mean that some
students look at javascript they freak out and
they click x and they never come back okay
and so i say that because i want to let you know that that's okay
if the very first time last class we looked at javascript right and you kind
of lost a little bit that's okay all right
here's the thing i need you to do though oh calamity pixie thank you for
hydration cheers to you i'm like here's this here's what you

00:30
need to do and i'm like oh sorry i just need to drink something real quick
here's what you need to do you need to play more you have to understand
that the syntax is not going to make sense
it just won't for some folks they come to programming with different mental
models than others and when they look at it at first it just doesn't make sense
but what you have to do is type it out play with it
break it delete it do it again type it out play with it break it delete
it do it again play with it break it delete it do it again and you do that over
and over again and if you did that for the code that we ran into last week
you would start to notice some patterns and early on

00:31
learning the code is simply pattern recognition you won't really know
what's happening under the hood until we get further on
so you're going to see some things the document you're going to see the the
the query selector and you're not going to know that query selector is a method
built into javascript it doesn't matter that you know the terminology or what's
happening underneath of it you just have
to know that when i use that thing i can i can grab stuff right and so you play
you break you delete and you do it again right
and you play you break you do it again and if you do this enough you start to
notice the little patterns and you at least have some syntax in
your brain so that as you start to do more complicated stuff you you have a
place to do it or you've already done it right and you might add some of that to
your inky you might add some of the things that you're running into that you

00:32
start to notice oh this is how i do a smurf for an event listener add that to
anki oh here's how i get a value out of an input let's add that to anki oh
here's how i put something back into the dom let me add that to anki right and
over time we will build up to more and more
complicated things and over time we'll break down and digest exactly what is
happening right but in the beginning you're trying to pattern recognize don't
also put on top of you this idea that you have to understand everything
you can't you won't it's too much i see some folks
that go really deep trying to really understand
all the things that an ad event listener
could do that's that's a little too much in the beginning play with it break it
you're better off trying to build something than you are doom scrolling on

00:33
the mdn for four hours i rather you build stuff at this stage
right build stuff at this stage than going super super into trying to
understand all the technical bits and bobs it's just too much cool
let's talk about variables i feel like leon was looking at my
shoulder while i was working on this i've done this for a little while i've
done this for a little while but yeah please you gotta be playful with yourself
you're one class into javascript you're one class you're a one class into
javascript if you're saying to yourself i can't do
this i can't do this i'll never do it what are you talking about
you're one class in and it wasn't even a

00:34
full class there was other stuff we were doing you're three hours in
you're three hours in if you understand anything in those
three hours you you're so far ahead of every single other person has ever tried
to do this please don't be upset at yourself that after
one class less than three hours of instruction you're not i'm not a
javascript master like i can't do it leave that reality at the door come play
with me we're here to dream folks we're here to dream it's okay
if you're trying to learn japanese after one class you want to be freaking out i
can't do this i'll never do this oh no you'd be dreaming about going to tokyo
speaking with folks having good time eating good food
right do the same thing when you're learning how to code be kind to yourself
you're one class in some folks bought the fast pass
it's okay if you don't have it you're going to take your time you're

00:35
going to play you're going to dream and from those dreams will build amazing
stuff all right let's talk about variables
what are variables how much is the fast pass [Laughter] that's that's the uh
that's leon premium [Laughter] sorry it's really funny [Music]
all right what are variables i see people throwing it in chat right
this is the fast pass exactly this is the fastpass you're going to be running
laps around folks that are not in this course
right you're going to be running laps around folks that are not in this course
folks that are coming out of other boot camps laps
right you're going to be on the roller coaster having a good time they're in
the parking lot they're not even in the they're not even
in yet they're in the parking lot looking at people on that roller coaster

00:36
going damn they're having a great time right don't compare yourself to folks in
the parking lot that are just seeing the
roller coaster go by they're not even in the park yet cool
all right variable people are saying data buckets
uh variables are a way we can tell our program to remember stuff to use later on
right that's all it is it's a it's a thing we use to store a value for later on
the other boot camps are a little caesar exactly right
it's a way for us to create a bucket put something in and then at any time in
the future we want the thing out of the bucket we can take it out and there are
two key steps when it comes to using variables the first step is declaration
the second step is assignment so if we have memory

00:37
if we have memory right so let's put a little memory box here beautiful
oh that's clean all right let's say we have some memory all right
we have some memory the first step is the declaration so i'm
going to go ahead and create a space in memory called age all right called age
now if i try to use age somewhere else in my code what would i get was is
would i get an error if i try to use age somewhere in my code what would happen
let's take a look at it let's actually do it together let's open up the
inspector here go to console let's go ahead and say let age right
and then let's ask for age now we're not really getting like a

00:38
pretty big error but we're getting undefined
what does that mean what is what does undefined mean let's ask for dog
not document frank i want to type out dog there we go
uncaught reference error dog is not defined okay so we saw here
that we declared age we created that space in memory but with dog with two g's
we didn't actually ever create that space in memory so we got two different
bits of information here when we declared it but never gave it a value we
get undefined right but if we never even declare it we
get this error saying hey it doesn't even exist in memory there's nothing in
memory called dog with two g's right and so when we look
let's type this out again on this first pass we do let age we

00:39
create a space in memory called age now if we ever ask for age it's going to say
it's undefined like it exists we know what bucket you're talking about
there's just nothing inside of it right we have a bucket called age there's just
nothing inside of it it is an empty bucket exactly so if we ask for that
bucket if we ask for age somewhere else in our code base it's just going to say
undefined right right it's going to say undefined like
we know what you're talking about there's just nothing in that bucket
the second step the assignment is where we put a value into that bucket
right so when we do the assignment we put 25 into the bucket now right
i can just in the console yeah you could js in the console
now if i ask for age at any point in time i'm going to get 25. so if i ask
for age if i if i want to throw it into a string

00:40
if i want to alert it if i want to console log if i want to do anything
with that age it'll now be 25 and it'll stay 25 until what
it'll stay 25 until what yeah until it's reassigned exactly
until it's reassigned when it's reassigned we take this value right we
take this value and we can do whatever we want with it so we could say age
equals age plus five right if i did um i just realized i'm
behind myself hold on let's go over here i could do age equals age plus five

00:41
what would i now be reassigning age to be yeah it'd be 30 right age was 25
now we did 25 plus 5 and that gives us 30. so now age is 30 and whatever was in
that space in memory is now 30. boom i love it cool
whenever i'm creating my variables i will use camelcase
right i'll use camelcase my first word will be lowercase every other word will
be capitalized right and we can't put spaces why can't we put spaces
yeah what what exactly some folks are saying it might be multiple variables
exactly if we if we use spaces we might run into some

00:42
problems where it's trying to find other things like of or apples and it's like
trying to see uh if they exist right so you would run
into like if we had a space here we would declare a space in memory called
number right but then like is it trying to call
a function is it trying to call like trying to find of is it trying to find
apples right so spaces can get us into trouble you can actually uh declare
multiple things at the same time by using commas so you could do like let dog
comma cat i don't know bird right and now you've
declared three things into memory but we
don't jump ahead too much on that i just want to say that to you so camo casing
is the one i like because i can reuse camo casing
right i can reuse camo casing across my html i can use it across my css and i

00:43
can use it on my javascript right so you're going to see me use camel casing
if you don't want to use cable casing that's okay just be consistent in
whatever you do use right some companies are going to
some companies are going to have different things that they want you to
do and it'll work uh closed captioning should be working
it's turned on i can see that it's listening to me make sure you actually
click the the icon yeah yeah it's working yeah i'll give it a
refresh if you need it and then click the little icon but it's on i can see
that it's working cool alrighty now we talked about two different kinds of types
right we said there's gonna be lots of different kinds of variables we talked
about two different types of like variables hold data right we're putting
data into those buckets and we said that there's two kinds of data we've talked
about so far we call these types what are the two things we've talked about so

00:44
far yeah numbers and strings exactly so let's
let's revisit those numbers and strings all right strings are pieces of text
they are going to be surrounded by either double quotes
single quotes or ticks which we'll see a little bit later today
now what's the thing we have to keep in mind when we're when we're wrapping our
strings in quotes one thing we have to keep in mind what's
the thing that could get us into trouble yeah [Music]
consistency is good but also yeah this idea is that whatever you use on the
inside like whatever you use on the inside you
have to be careful not to use on the outside or the same weather way around
right like whatever you use on the outside be careful not to use it on the
inside if you use the same stuff on the outside and on the inside you're gonna
have your string stop at that inside quote and then there's

00:45
gonna be some stuff that the the the program just doesn't recognize
so you to make sure that your quotes on the outside are different than the
quotes on the inside or or what could you do
yeah i could escape them right we could go ahead and do the uh let's say this
was double quotes right and so we have double quotes on the
outside we have double quotes on the on the outside and we have double quotes on
the inside this would this would break unless we escaped our characters
when we do that lovely backslash javascript doesn't read the backslash it
just says that quote's good to go don't stop the string
more we're going to see the the the template literal in a little bit later
tonight yeah what does it mean to escape it just means that you are not
going to run into trouble using the same on the uh on the inside

00:46
is on the outside basically you're telling it to ignore it so escaping is
the same as like ignore it don't end the string cool
we talked about numbers there are actually two different kinds of numbers
we have integers which are whole numbers and floated values which are numbers
with decimal places so you're going to hear people say refer
to numbers as integer values or floated values and when they say float it they
just mean it has a decimal place we also can have signed numbers meaning
that numbers can be positive and negative in javascript you'll see that
and then we have basic arithmetic and so with our arithmetic you will use
the plus sign for addition you'll use the hyphen for subtraction
you'll use the asterisk for multiplication you'll use the forward

00:47
sign uh sorry the forward slash for division and then we have this lovely
modulus not a percent it's a modulus what does modulus do for us
yeah it gives us the remainder so remainder is like you divide a number in
and whatever is left over is what you get as a result of modulus so if we did
10 mod 2 what are we getting we did ten mod two chat what are we
doing what are we getting back yeah we're getting zero
right we're getting zero because two went into ten five times and there's
nothing left over so we get zero how about ten mod four
what do we get with ten mod four yeah we'd get two exactly because four

00:48
would go into ten two times which is eight and we'd have two left over oh
how about one more ten mod 6 what will we get
yeah we have 4 right because 6 goes into 10 one time there's 4 left over
beautiful all right what can modules be really helpful for
really early on like we said there's like a use case where modulus could be
helpful for us when when we when when we use modulus early on what could it help
us with yeah even an odd exactly right if we take any number and modulus two
and we get zero we know that it's an even number right eight mod two would
give us zero six mod two would give us zero four mod two would give us zero so
anytime you get the zero back you would know that it's even if you ever had any
kind of remainder you would know that it is odd so we can use this modulus early
on to do things like even and odd which is pretty helpful
some folks are saying you could help with primes yeah it could probably help

00:49
with primes too yeah alrighty now that's variables we talked about variables as
buckets that can hold a value for use later on that's one of the big four
the second or the big four are conditionals
conditionals enable us to do something if a statement is true so if a statement
is true we would do what's inside of the curly braces
right now to utilize conditionals well we actually have to know how to do
comparison we need to figure out if something is true or false right so in
this case i think our age is at 30 right now because we did 25 plus 5. so if we
used age here as a variable and it's equal to 30
what would inside the parentheses evaluate to what would this what would
this evaluate to in the end what does that evaluate to i know it's a

00:50
weird thing to say what does it evaluate to yeah it evaluates the true right
30 is indeed greater than 18 and so that is a true statement what happens inside
the parentheses is that this is the same thing as saying true and if
the statement is true you do what's inside the curly braces so
we would see in the console log you are an adult right you are an adult right so
if right if we want to do more in-depth conditionals right if we want to be able
to to do things and and and do things only in certain
scenarios we have to get better at understanding comparison are things true
or false and so let's break down comparison together
we know javascript is a little funky when it comes to comparison because we

00:51
can compare not only numbers we can also like compare strings to each other
javascript is a little a little loose like that cool
now here we have the example that we skirted at the at
last class right we only did we only did a few of them and then we then we uh
then we moved on so whenever you see a variable let's say there's let here
whenever you see one equal sign what is that always going to be in javascript
land what is the one equal sign always going to be yeah it's always going to be
assignment right we had memory right we had memory
and we created a new space in memory called x and then we assigned that space in
memory the value of 3. so anytime i want to use x
right now until i reassign it it is the value of 3.

00:52
all right so let's look at this first one
i'm going to look at x i need to use x x right now is what chat x is what right
now x is three right now great when i see two equal signs
right i notice right here i have two equal signs
down here i have three when i have two equal signs
what am i talking about what am i comparing yeah it's just value
one equal sign has nothing to do with comparison that is assignment
two equal signs is just value are the values the same so in this case is three
equal to eight no three and eight are two completely
different values that is a false statement all right next one is

00:53
three equal to string three but now when
we have three equal signs we're not only looking at value we are also looking at
type so is number three equal to string three in value
in value let's do value first yes number three and string three are the
same value they're both three however with three equal signs we also care
about type is number three equal to string three in type no
one is a number one is a string that makes this a false statement next one
all right all right let's do the next one three there's number three

00:54
equal number three in value yes all right number three equals number
three and value now does number three equal number three in type
i hope so yeah yes right yes right three is equal to three in value and type
cool now let's start doing the trickier ones let's start doing the trickier ones
does three not equal eight in value when it's when it's when it's the
exclamation point that means not that means not so we're saying not equal
and it's just one equal sign right so that means that we're saying not equal
in value so does three not equal eight in value yeah that's a

00:55
true statement yes three does not equal eight in value one is three one is eight
beautiful now this is where people run away and cry right here you ready for
this one three does three sorry number three not equal string three in value and
type that's a true statement number three
does not equal string three in value and
type it's equal in value but not in type so since it is not equal in value and
type that is a true statement it is not equal in value and type right
you see that the bank equal equals that's value and type right so number
three is not equal to string three in value and type right

00:56
it's just value that is a true statement don't worry about that one that bri it
just breaks people's brains i don't know why i i had to come back to that one
like four or five times before it actually clicked yeah
yeah so don't let that one break your brain a little bit right you're gonna
see it a lot we're gonna bring it up in real real world scenarios but what we're
saying here is that three doesn't equal string three like number three does not
equal string three in both value and type so that's a true statement right it
doesn't equal it right it's like the same thing as saying like
like zebra doesn't equal duck yeah of course zebra doesn't equal duck
they're different things well the number and the string are different things so
that is a true statement cool uh next one does number three
not equal number three in value and type this number three

00:57
not equal number three in value and type it does number three does
equal number three in value and type right they're both numbers they both
have the same value so this is a false statement right they are both equal in
value and type so this is a false statement all right last four here
is three greater than eight no right now the the exclamation point means not
that's what we were saying not it's not x x is the variable here cool 3 is not
greater than 8 so that's false is 3 less than 8 yes

00:58
yep three is less than eight beautiful is three greater than or equal to eight
no three is not greater than or equal to eight
is three less than or equal to eight yeah three is less than or equal to eight
cool all right now if these two broke your brain that's
okay i had to look at this like three or four times myself before i start the
click re-watch this part of the vod come back to it
change up x to be a different number i want everyone to come back to this
regardless if it clicked or not i want you to come back to this as part of your
homework right and change x to eight right change x to eight right
go through it again and the cool thing is you all could have
been cheating this whole time right you could have been cheating this whole time
open up your inspector go to your console right and then just do

00:59
let x equal three right and then you can do like hey does x not equal eight
and it'll give you the answers right there right use your console as a place to
execute your javascript for now right you all the things that you're thinking
about you can come in here and just play with you can throw them in there see if
it's true false play with a lot of other stuff in here too yep cool alrighty
we're going to come back we're going to look through more conditional syntax
and then we are going to see this conditional syntax in play in our class
weekend or boring day we're going to review that last piece we
wanted to make sure that it worked with any casing lowercase uppercase and so
we're going to go over that together we're going to go through more
conditional logic together but before that we have to take a break if you're

01:00
new around here we like to be healthy we like to take our our
our idea of going through a boot camp as
a marathon not a sprint and so if you're able get up walk around
please look at something that's not your scream for at least 20 seconds look out
something that's far in the distance if you can
right let your eyes focus on something else grab some water hydrate
right and we'll be back in five if you're watching us on youtube
hey go ahead and give us a like please subscribe if you haven't already
helps us out helps more folks find the boot camp and not to spay
pay tens of thousands of dollars to get the same material

01:04
alrighty folks five minutes see then he's free free oh i was saying
thanks for the engagement uh hashtag no clothes [Laughter]
give bob close what's pretty funny merry mouse hey thank you for the five

01:05
gifts it subs hope you're doing well thank you for being here
so many folks ordering dominoes right now i i saw to see
no i do jr you know i do uh was it my birthday it was somebody in uh chat uh
liking on the name there you go a miracle there you go it
was a miracle's birthday so i swapped over to the birthday screen
they're they're spending their birthday with us
if domino's wants to make you ceo what would you do i have a ten point plan
uh to to get dominoes everywhere domino's has one of the

01:06
best tech teams actually they have like a really good strong like engineering
team that's done a lot of stuff like i joke around about dominoes but i'm not
joking around dominoes like they they have like a really strong tech team
they've innovated in a lot of really cool ways like pizza tracker
like pizza tracker is like revolutionary they had pizza tracker before any of
these other companies had ways of like tracking like if your food was on the
way or done yet like we look at like uber and you realize like that started
with dominoes right like better routing like all this stuff is
like domino's has serious tech behind them and they've led the way
and so yeah we like to we like to talk about it but they they have one of the
best tech teams out there get bob a domino shirt hey if domino sent me a shirt
he'd wear it all the time they would have free advertising for the the rest

01:07
of the rest of our days here just saying they have a patent on the dominus
tracker that's funny that's pretty cool i mean it makes sense
all right folks come on back come on back you had a good break alrighty
cool let's chill the music all right so we looked at our
conditional right we looked at we know how to do comparison we know how to do
greater than less than equals not equals beautiful so let's actually start
applying this to our conditionals right and so the way a conditional works is if
whatever is inside the parentheses evaluates the true then we do what is
inside the curly braces all right so if we look at it here not only is it if
right but there's also else if and else's so ifs are the first thing to run

01:08
and if for any reason what was inside the parentheses is false
then we move on to the else if and you can actually have as many else
ifs as you want right so you'll go if if it's false you'll move on to the else
if right if it's if it's false you'll move
on to the next else if the next else if the next else if you have as many as you
want and then if you want you don't have to have it but you can have an else
right you don't have to have it that's something that has to always be there
but if you have an else and everything above it
right everything else above it was false then the else automatically runs
right it just automatically runs it doesn't need to check anything it just runs
where would someone use a ton of elsifs so there are actually things in
javascript that make conditional syntax easier switches and things like that but
we've we saw some good examples we wanted to figure out what day of the

01:09
week it was right we could use a conditional um you want to figure out
your your horoscope you could use a conditional right there's a lot of times
where you have to make decisions based on information that's coming in right
rock paper scissors all these things there are times you have to make
decisions right based off of stuff that's coming in
and that's what you use the conditional for thank you for the tier three i
appreciate that cool let's take a look at a real one here so
we saw kant's pizza what what does const mean again we we kind of hinted at this
last class what does const mean again kant's pizza what does that mean
yeah it's a variable that will not be reassigned
right it's a variable that will not be reassigned you can't reassign it right
and so since our pizza choices will never change we make pizza accounts

01:10
because it will always be dominoes all right now
we look at this conditional and we say does pizza equal papa john's no
it never will be right it never will be and so since this is false
we go to our elsif right now in this case does pizza equal domino's yes our
variable of pizza is equal to dominoes so since this is true we
do what's inside the curly braces and in the console we would see
all aboard the train to flavor town now does our else ever run
no it will never run because we had a true statement here so the else
never got a chance to run now papa john's been doing some stuff on thursday

01:11
i'm launching my campaign to defeat papa john's that's all i'm going to say
so i'm going to say for right now so i'm going to say come back thursday
if you want to participate in the campaign to beat papa john's i see a lot of
people saying finally i'm right there with you i'm excited yes thursday
we go to war i'm coming for you but we i don't wanna
i don't wanna i don't wanna say too much don't wanna say too much
come back thursday alrighty i say that there is a there's a
danger right there's a danger right there's a danger of assignment
versus comparison what does that mean how could i get in trouble yeah it's the

01:12
one equal sign versus two or three if i ever use one equal sign like if i'm in
here and i used one equal sign instead of two or three that would try and do
reassignment right you always have to have two or three equal signs when
you're trying to compare stuff so if you
accidentally ever just do one equal sign inside of your ifs or else if you're
going to actually reassign your variable right there right and so that's
something you can run into because that actually might wind up being a truthy or
truthful statement right so even though you're trying to do comparison if you
did one it would be reassignment and you're going to run into some issues
so be careful when you're using your elsif's and your ifs make sure you're
using two or three equal signs one will always be assignment or reassignment
cool uh we can do multiple conditions right
we can check for for two things at the same time so if your name is leon
and your status equals ballin you have to do what's inside the curly

01:13
braces right and so we would go to big cam here and give you a wink
and then we go back it's like got you got another wink
let me put our glasses back on let me go back to the game
there we go all right because name was leon
and status equals ballin and so since both of those are true statements
remember when you have the ampersand the
double ampersand right it means and both cases must be true and since both cases
are true you get a wink at the camera right there you go
you can clip it if you want to keep it for for longer alrighty we saw and

01:14
we could also do or right [Laughter] this way you all cat said stop i'm
blushing all right you can go ahead and blush all right or
right you can do one or the other right with and both cases have to be
true only fans sneak peek exactly so i'm telling you the the content you're
missing out on by not getting to a million channel points
is wild i can't wait i've been thinking about like angles and outfits and like i
i looked at inflatable hot tubs like i'm ready i just need one of y'all to hit
the million channel points that's all i need but you got to do it all right
i got i got better lighting like i'm ready i'm ready all right
we saw and which was for both must be true right
but or just one has to be true so i can say day equals saturday or day equals

01:15
sunday as long as one of those was true then we would do it's the weekend
let's go ahead and take a look at this class weekend or boring day we did most
of the code together but there was one right there was one really important
thing that i wanted to do which was make it work with uppercase and lowercase
letters let's take a look so if you need the starter code for
today uh you can find all the starter code in our
in our discord you can do exclamation point discord here in chat leonel.com
discord you agree to the rules and then you'll see a follow-on materials channel
where you can always download the material also just as another reminder
we had a lot of new folks joining the discord recently uh you have to not only
agree to rules but you also want to make sure you've clicked on the emojis and
the join 100 devs channel if you don't click those emojis you don't get access
to all the 100 devs content so make sure you click on those so you get access to

01:16
all the channels all right so i think i missed uh a fiver
honest hey jonas thank you for the 5k that subs i appreciate that thank you
for being here cool truly gifted uh sub to nightbot
thank you for gifting this up the nightbot i wonder if that was random or
if you did that on purpose if you did if it was random i feel bad
for the person that didn't get it but if you did over was that's pretty funny
nightbot's a bot that runs in chat that does all the commands all right
so we're going to look at this class weekender boring i'm going to open
up the html i'm going to open up the javascript and
here we have the normal code that we had
already so i'm going to open this in the browser
and i'm going to be a little bit bigger and so we can put in the day of the week

01:17
so let's put in tuesday right and check it oh no that's inspect
oh it's console logging we didn't put in the dom yet so you can
see it you can see that we have class all right we have we have class
you see that i keep clicking it and it keeps going up
right if i however put in tuesday i get boring that's not right it's not
boring we got class tonight and it's because the capital t
is not the same as the lowercase t and so i asked you to fix that as part of
the homework so let's take a look at our
code let's see what's going on and let's see if we can fix this all right
if we looked we saw that we had two things here we had our lovely input
right where we're putting the day of the week and we can see that it has the id

01:18
of day and we also have the button that we're
clicking on that has the id of check right it's important we're going to use
these ids so we can place our event listeners and also grab stuff out of
that input so the input has the id of day
and the button has the id of check let's look at our javascript all right
document that means we're going to go look
at the rendering of the html and the css right we're gonna go look remember when
we when we when we open up our browser right when we open up our browser and we
see all the stuff that we see that's not actually
our html it's not actually our css it's the rendering of that html and css and
the cool thing about this rendering this dom

01:19
is that what can mess with it what can mess with this rendering
javascript exactly javascript can come in here and do whatever the heck it
wants to this render right but as soon as i refresh what happens
as soon as i refresh what happens it all goes away when we do the refresh
we reread our html we re-read our css we repaint this picture that we call the
dom and then javascript can come in and mess with it again cool so
if we look here we're saying hey go to that dom thing and in it
find something that has the id of check what had the id of check
i had the idea of check yeah the button that we're gonna click on had

01:20
that id right if we look button has the id of check great and so
what we're doing is we are looking right we're looking in that render for
the thing that had the idea of check and
then we're putting a what on it what are we putting on it we putting on that
button we're putting on there put a smurf exactly put a little smurf
on that button a little smurf is sitting on that button
all right a little smurf is sitting on that button and it's waiting for a click
it's waiting it's waiting it's waiting and we know that it's waiting for a click
because we said add event listener click
we could have given it some other things to listen for we could have told it to
right we could have told it to listen for a mouse enter

01:21
we could have told it to listen for a double click we could have told it to
listen for a mouse leave right but we told it hey smurf listen for a click
and when you hear a click what set of instructions do you want us
to run like what do you what do you want the what do you want javascript do you
want to what do you want the computer to do what set of instructions
why do they call it a smurf i i made it up they don't please don't think smurfs
are built into javascript it's just an example i give there's no
smurfs built into javascript i just like to call them smurfs because i it's
easier for me to sit there and think that they're i don't know why
it's easier for me to sit there and think that there are like little smurfs
sitting on all my buttons waiting to be clicked so i just makes it work in my
brain better all right so when it hears the click when it hears the click
we got the check uh oh hype train thank you for the hype
training folks i appreciate y'all thank you for all the spending off of all of

01:22
uh jeff bezos's hard owner money whenever i see jeff bezos on a yacht i'm
like i'm getting a piece of that so thank you for the for the twitch primes
when you have prime you can you can sub for free so i appreciate you spending
all bezos money makes you feel a bit better all right so we got this check
we're listening for the click and when we hear the check when we hear
the click we run the set of instructions called check so here are the set of
instructions with the name of check these two were tied right you were tied
right cool now i heard the click i run check the very
first thing i do is i go back to that dom the rendering right
i find something that has the id of day we have the idea of day

01:23
somebody said do functions run if you don't put them in an event listener you
always have to tell functions to run they won't run by themselves you can
either call the function and we're going to learn more about functions soon you
can either like tell them to run right or you can put them in an event
list and the run when you hear the event we're going to cover more about
functions later today and next class for
sure so you gotta you gotta tell them to run they just don't magically run by
themselves you'll call it people calling that like
invoke them or run them yeah we'll get there though
cool yeah it was the input the input had the id of day if we look
input has the id of day beautiful so we went into that dom thingy the rendering
we found the input and what do you think value does it says
the value what do you think that does what does that help us with value yeah
it helps us get the value out of the input so whatever was in that input is

01:24
now pulled out now normally i would take the value out and poof it
would disappear into the ether right like i would grab the value and poof it
would disappear why does the value not poof and disappear into the ether
why why did why didn't we grab it and then immediately lose it yeah
hey turn up look at this go yeah cause we're assigning it today
right we're assigning it today so whatever was in that input right is now
sitting right is now sitting inside the variable called day right so
whatever was in that input is now in our bucket called day

01:25
right so we had a bucket called day and if in my input i had tuesday
right and in my input i had tuesday and i clicked i got the value out of that
input i stored it in the day bucket that means sitting inside of day
would be string tuesday right we got the value out of the input
right we got the value out of the input and we stored it in the bucket called
day where does value come from it's built into javascript
dot value is built into javascript add event listener query selector all these
things are built into javascript so that we don't have to figure out how to do
them ourselves imagine if you had to figure out how to
listen for clicks in the browser right this is what ad event listener is

01:26
doing imagine if you had to code that from scratch
imagine if you had to write the code to like peer into the dom imagine if you
had to write the code that enabled you to pull stuff out of inputs
it would just take forever right so one of the reasons why we use javascript
is so much of this stuff has already been done for us
we sit on top of the shoulders of giants
that have gone through the muck to build all this stuff out for us
and that's why it's a little bit higher level it's a higher level language a lot
of this stuff has already been written for us so that we don't have to
right that's the beauty of javascript and so in the beginning
we talked about this idea of i'm lost i don't get what's going on well it's
because you didn't learn these words yet right and there's no way you could have
known these words until we go over them right and so the idea being here is that

01:27
when we use javascript we get a lot of stuff that's built in and early on one
of the probably the biggest things that you're going to have trouble with is
saying hmm what is built in right and what is not built in
like what is built in and what is not built in that's one of the hardest
things kind of early on that's why i asked you to play
right so i asked you to take this break it rebuild it delete it do it over and
over and over again right the mdn has a list of all the built-in
stuff but we're gonna see it together over and over again right this is class
two we're gonna have 10 15 20 more classes on javascript right
and we're going to see these pieces over and over again but you have to do your
part you have to play you have to delete
it all and type a bell back out you have to delete it all and then delete it all
again right and so you got to make sure you keep playing you keep doing right

01:28
and as you do that you'll start to realize huh that's what i could change
and i couldn't change this or actually i know that that that's something i wrote
and that's not something that comes into
javascript but you have to be willing to type it all out delete that whole thing
type it all out again delete it do that whole thing over and over again
it's the only way it sticks because there's so many new words so
many new bits of terminology that you can't be expected to just like see it
and get it you gotta play with it cool so we got the value of tuesday
out of the input all right so now inside of day we are holding tuesday
so does day equal tuesday yeah day equals tuesday in this instance and
so since this is an or we don't even really need to check the other side

01:29
right we already know when it's or only one has to be true right like this side
had to be true or this side had to be true but since we already know something
is true we can go ahead and console.log you have class now the problem is
if we change this to uppercase tuesday it won't work right we've pulled
tuesday out of the input we stored it in our variable of day all right
and now when we go and compare day to lower case tuesday they are different
day right now is the same thing as uppercase tuesday and so uppercase
tuesday is not equal to lowercase tuesday right so how do we
make sure that we don't have to worry about casing and run into the problem

01:30
that we're running into right now yeah we could we could do this to lower case
boom two lower case beautiful let's try it out now let's save it let's
refresh great it's saying you have class right you have class
it noticed that even though the t was capitalized we can do lowercase t as
well we still get you have class right and so what this right here
this two lower class is something that is built into javascript
to take all your letters and make them lower case
you didn't have to code it you could have coded it right you could have coded
a function or sets of instructions that took your word and made all the letters

01:31
lowercase but it is built in to javascript eventually we're going to call these
things like methods or functions that are built in right but right now
two lower cases saying hey whatever you got out of this document right whatever
the value was make it all lowercase right no matter what we got out of the
value it is now all lowercase right and then we can do our comparison is it
tuesday or thursday is it saturday or sunday and if it's not tuesday thursday
saturday or sunday we get boring cool now a lot of people are saying leon why
const will day ever be reassigned here's a really this
is like this is like a next level question here will day ever be reassigned

01:32
nope now some people were saying leon but if i keep re-running the function
it's gonna be day could be different things it could be tuesday it could be
saturday but look that's inside this function though every
single time you click you're running these sets of instructions again
there are different versions of the same thing so this day never gets reassigned
you just assign it for the first time whenever you click
i know it's a little it's a little lie it's a little too much for right now
but there's the day is not really being reassigned it's just that you're running
the set of instructions again right it's just that you're re-running the set
of instructions over and over again you're not really reassigning something
you're just reassigning those you're just redoing those sets of instructions
yeah like resets it runs again yeah cool all righty feeling good about this one

01:33
keep pushing keep pushing yeah some folks are throwing out this
word scope we'll get the scope later on but i came across it in your reading
yeah oh we got a posture check daddy's home 420 thank you for the posture check
that's it right i got a i got a foot rest now so i gotta
make sure i'm in my foot rest max in the right spot thank you appreciate you
all right let's move on angry parent simulator
i'm about to show you a whole lot of code don't don't run away i'm going to show
you how i'm going to show you a lot of code all right let's take a look at this
angry parent simulator all right i'm going to close all this
stuff up i'm going to open up the angry parent simulator and open up the
javascript and i'm going to open it in the browser just to see it

01:34
i thought leon said pasta check show me your pasta is it angel hair
is that linguine pasta track alrighty let's put a name here let's put
bob's name in here bob bobber boppity bobson cool so bob bobber boppity-bopson
is bob's name and so let's go ahead and yell
and we see bob bobber boppity-bopson right so this is
i knew i knew when my friend was in trouble growing up
i knew when like we when we re like when we like
when we were like when we really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
like when we like really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this is how i knew right when
when the parents weren't just using their middle name but they were using
their christian name too like it was over we were cut i was going home

01:35
i was going to see him for a couple weeks so this is an this is an ode uh
to how you know you've done messed up uh when when parents are calling not
only your middle name but also your given name so let's go ahead and and and
look through how we could do this so what we are doing here is we're putting a
first middle last middle and last name into different
inputs and when i click yell i'm pulling a value from each of those inputs
that is then being put into the dom right you thought his name was robert no his
name's not robert his name is bob well and so what we're going to do is we're
going to figure out all right how do i get something out of here here
and then how do i put that into the dom right that's what we're going to look at

01:36
now i'm going to show you a couple different ways that this could be done
and so this is this is meant for us to see stuff what i'm trying to do is i'm
trying to give you lots of example code that you can then come back and sample
right you can come back and sample this bits of code the way i did stuff to use
in your projects going forward different lego pieces that you can actually use
all right if we look here are all of our inputs right
uh our first input has the idea first name
our second input has the idea of first middle
our third has the id of last middle and then the last name has the idea of last
name right and so we have all of these inputs
that all have their own ids that we can use to pull the value out

01:37
right to pull the value out cool we also have the button with the id of yell
right so the button with the id of yell is the thing that we're going to
actually click all right we're going to actually click that button
we're going to pull all the stuff out of the inputs all right and then
we're going to place all that stuff into the h2 that's the goal
right pull all the stuff out of it we already saw how to get stuff out of the
input we're gonna pull all the stuff out of all the different inputs right
well different inputs and then put it back into the dom let's take a look at
that all right i have my event listener i have my smurf that is set up
my smurf is set up to listen for a click on the yell button right
so when i click on the button that has the id of yell i'm going to run

01:38
these sets of instructions right so if we look here's my function called run
or my set of instructions that i am going to run and so what i'm going to do
is i'm going to grab the names out of every input
right i'm going to grab the names out of every input so here
i am grabbing the name out of the first input and i am setting it equal to
the variable called fname then i'm going to grab the value out of
the second input and store it in the variable fmid name
same thing for the third and the same thing for the last i'm just going
through and pulling the values out of the inputs and storing them in my

01:39
buckets or my variables right so if i did this right right if i did this right
i should now have four variables holding each of the names
the last thing i have to do right the last thing i have to do is put those names
into the dom so here's a new way of doing i'm going to actually comment out
this new way for a second i want to show you the old way
here's the old way of taking each of those names
and putting them into the dom right so here if we look we're saying all right
go to the dom find the thing that has the idea of place tl if we look
this h2 has the idea of place to yell this is where i'm gonna put this stuff
right cool and what am i gonna put in it i'm gonna
put some text inside of it that's what inner text stands for inner text means

01:40
i'm going to put some text inside of it so some text is going to go inside that
h2 and then i'm going to put all the variables right and put all the variables
into that h2 some folks are saying what's the difference between inner text
and inner html well text is just text inner html means you can put like actual
html elements you can put like lis and anchor tags and spans anything you want
in there but we're just doing what text so here we go i'm gonna take the first
name and then we're doing what's called concatenation
concat nation what do you think i mean by concat nation
what do you what do you think i mean by concatenating what am i doing when i
when i'm concatenating i'm not saying cat nation i'm not saying meow
concatenating yeah you're putting it all together into
one big string like you're just adding everything together it comes together as
one big string and then that big string is what we're

01:41
putting into the dom and so if you look we take the name and then we add empty
quotes then we take the other name and we add empty quotes
empty quotes the other name empty quotes what am i doing there
why am i putting empty quotes in yeah i'm adding spaces i want a space
between each name like if i look i i don't want it to be like bob bobber i
want it to have spaces in between so that's what the concatenation does
that's why i'm concatenating an empty space
right i'm concatenating empty spaces so i have spaces between this whole string
that's going into my h2 so that's the old that's the old way of doing it
but now we have something called template literals or template strings
which have kind of changed the game a little bit
all right so same thing we're going to go into the dom
we're going to find the thing that has the idea of place to yell

01:42
we're going to put some text inside of it but look we start off with ticks
right we start off with ticks and then we have some fancy stuff inside
those ticks now ticks are this are a new way of
doing quotes basically you don't know where a tick is a tick is on the tilde key
so like right there above your tab you have a key
that has a tilde on it and then the tick is on that one right there for you
that's how you do ticks right on my kinesis my tick is at a very
different place then we have a tick right so the tick opens and the tick closes
now the cool thing is the cool thing is right you can now plug in variables
using this new syntax if you're inside of a tick you can use this syntax

01:43
the bling curly braces with the variable inside and so now we
can plug in all of our variables with the spaces already there
and this gets turned into one string so instead of having to do all these
plus signs adding empty spaces we start our string and close the string
with a tick and then we can use this newer
template literal syntax this bling with the curly braces to plug in our variable
names pretty sweet yeah template literal exactly yeah and so
it's just a fancier way of doing it but the cool thing is you don't have to do
all these plus signs any white space you put in is there right so you have the
spaces you don't worry about it so you're going to come across this
sometimes you're going to come across this a lot in older code basis too

01:44
why the bling curly braces that's just the syntax
that's the decision they chose for inserting a variable into the template string
that's all cool all right so this is all fine and good but i want to
show you something else i have some other cool code here i'm
just going to comment out our code up here real quick we're not going to spend
too much time with this i want to just show you something i think it's pretty
neat um i'm going to uncomment this code down here i'm going to save it
and i'm going to show you what this does now all right hold on

01:45
all right let's go back let's refresh bob bobber boppity bopston i'm gonna yell
son all right that was fire i'm not gonna lie
really proud of myself for that one all right so the cool thing is

01:46
uh we use some code right that i found off the internets to do speech synthesis
so built in to the browser now is this ability to do speech synthesis and so
what i was able to do is i was able to grab this speech synthesis stuff
and uh plug in my code to make it spit hot bars right
and now the cool thing is the question i have to ask you
if i was to like delete all this do you think i could type this out
like if i was just to delete this do you think i could type this
and this line out no absolutely not i i do not have this
memorized this is not anything in my brain i was just like i want to do this
very specific thing i googled it and saw oh it's built into
the browsers nowadays it's a newer thing that's built in that i can use but i
don't have this memorized this is not something that's in my brain if i was to
delete this i would have no idea how to start i would have to go back

01:47
find it on on on on the mdn and then use it
right and so you're gonna push yourself right you're going to push yourself so i
said you didn't anki it now i didn't end
it because i don't expect to really ever use this this was for a very specific
project i was building a app for for something very specific there's a
game called overwatch that i play and i noticed that i couldn't find a way
for folks that may be deaf to like to to know
that something was about to happen in the game right
in the game there are these sounds that you hear
and if you hear the sound you're about to get shot in the face
right so if you hear it it's high noon you're about to get shot in the face
right it's somebody's special move um there are all these like sounds that
before you do your special move uh the sounds play and i couldn't like figure
out how to like turn it on so i was like like an accessibility feature for it so

01:48
i was like wait let me let me see if i could build something that could listen
for those sounds right and then like flash a color on the screen
and and it worked right it worked and so i was able to use
this speech synthesis to not only say stuff but to also listen for stuff and
it was just a it's just an idea that popped in my brain and i was able to do
it right and so as you start to learn code right as you start to learn more
you're gonna be able to just like google stuff and this took me like three
seconds right to be like oh there's speech synthesis and i can make it say
stuff can i also make it listen right and so you'll notice there's nothing
really new here i i set up the speech synthesis i'm saying hey like
browser i have the speech synthesis set up and then i just have my normal click
event i'm getting all my stuff from the dom just like normal right
except i put it into a variable right instead of instead of i have all
my stuff in a variable right then a variable and instead of just plugging

01:49
that variable into the dom i also pass that variable
into this speech synthesis stuff and that's what makes it say it so i
didn't code this i just googled it copied those three lines of code and
boom it's over right it works now if i was delete this i would have no idea
what the heck's going on and i i say this and i mentioned this
because you have to free yourself right from this idea that like
javascript developers have all this stuff memorized and like we can code it
all from scratch no we're gonna use the mdn
we're gonna google it when we have to we're gonna copy and paste the pieces
that we need and we make it work we get the job done right but it's not
something i'm just not sitting here like for like 10 hours a day like this
just clicking clack i'm not got it yep hacked my frame yep carry the

01:50
carry to five yep cool we're doing good we're doing good
yep okay it's not that for 10 hours right it's not that
here's what coating looks like for 10 hours a day i wonder
if someone has never my coffee break go play with my dog for a few minutes
i'll be back then you come back and it's like hmm i wonder
if i could make my computer talk okay let's figure that out
hey bob do you know how to make the computer talk no all right cool

01:51
let's go over here google make browser talk oh
use javascript to make your browser speak that sounds dope
how can i make my web browser speak programmatically let's start over and
start over there oh speech synthesis speak hmm too much text is there anybody
that's done it already okay utterance here you go that works
so it looks like i can use this and this and that should work so i would
copy that and paste it in maybe it works maybe it doesn't well i

01:52
didn't really like it let's go back and look at that blog post real quick hmm
okay they're using the same thing new speak okay let me just copy that
let me paste it in and let me see if it works that right there folks
is programming welcome that's it that's what i that's what that's what i do
like like 90 of my day is just that i wonder if i can do it let me see if
somebody else has done it let me ask other folks that may have
done it in the past right it's it's not sitting there like
no first sometimes you get flow sometimes you do get into a flow state
right you are figuring out but it's a lot of trying to solve problems
that have probably already been solved just in different contexts right and so
a lot early on is about like recognizing different

01:53
building blocks different legos and putting these different legos together
right it has nothing to do with like being good at javascript like i like i'm
building web applications i'm really not reinventing the wheel very often
right it's very rare that i'm like reinvent the wheel i'm really doing
something i'm putting different building blocks together i'm gluing a lot of
different things together i get really good at the glue and the building but
it's rare that i have to like really coat something custom i do maybe 10 of
my time right but i'm putting different things together and so we're really good
lego players we're we're putting different pieces together and so in the
beginning you don't have to stress yourself out being like i don't
understand how i would code this from scratch you're not going to specifically
in the beginning you're going to take pieces and put them together and what
you have to be good at is finding those pieces and so what i have done

01:54
and what we're going to see as we move into the next project
is over these last few examples i've given you all the pieces or the building
blocks that you need and now it's your job to take those building blocks and
arrange them in the way that solves your problem
and all we're going to be doing over the next couple weeks is adding more blocks
that we can use we got a long yellow one we got a short red one we got a four by
eight like we're gonna have all these different pieces that you're gonna have
to be able to think through and and put together but that's our job in the
beginning we're just playing with legos and that's why i really do emphasize
like you should be having fun with this like it should be something that like
you're not letting the anxiety get to you you're just playing with legos
you're playing with legos while riding a roller coaster
have some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fun with it for real
right like you're on a roller coaster playing with legos have some fun with it

01:55
who cares if you have to start over again
rebuild a different lego set right have fun with it build break don't let the
anxiety creep in all right so i want to stop here we're going to take our break
when we come back from a break we're going to talk about pseudo code right
we're going to talk about how we can talk about those different pieces in
plain language we're not going to get technical we're just going to talk about
the things that we want to have happen in our programs the order in which we
want them to happen right and we're going to talk about that pseudo code and
then we're going to build a temperature converter together so let's go ahead and
take our break uh please if you're able get up move around walk around stretch
hydrate and we'll be back in five we put five minutes on the timer

01:59
all right see you soon i love that too j-meg
they said i love how chat is slow shoes everyone's on break exactly taking that
break shadow that's it that's all you need don't need more than that
unless you have problems that require different tools but that should be

02:00
enough for pretty much everything gw now we don't touch on jquery it's kind of
not in vogue anymore we can do all that cool stuff with just regular javascript
these days that's cool squiddy uh my glasses do have a blue light filter
they do i don't know how much it works in some conflicting stuff but i like them
ah true occ we'll use mongodb exactly back up pizza place get out of here it's
domino's or bust baby if domino's is closed for some reason i'm just not
eating pizza that day get out of here if bob came to life and offered you a
helping hand in anything that you needed what would it be
i would love if bob could walk the dogs every once in a while

02:01
i think that would be really helpful just be cool if they got like more more
walks you know and so if bob could do it that'd be great
all right folks come on back come on back lots of fun stuff to get into
alrighty welcome back everyone all right somebody said what about
semicolons with the newer versions of like the the newer versions of
javascript you can omit them if you want
to you can actually do exclamation point exclamation exclamation point semicolon
and you can read an article on it or we should start saying bang semicolon now
right oh all right folks come on back come on back let's go into this last bit

02:02
together wait can you hear stuff coming from my computer does that work hold on
no right all right cool because like i could hear i could hear the um
when the timer goes off there's like a sound i could hear i just think my my
headphones were really loud that's funny all right let's talk about pseudocode
folks welcome back welcome back so pseudocode is what we're going to use
when we start trying to tackle problems right so we're going to use when we
start trying to tackle problems we're going to approach our coding problems
in plain language before we ever even think about

02:03
syntax all right before we even before we ever even think about syntax
right and so whenever i approach a new challenge a new coding problem
i think through what i'm going to do in plain language often i will talk to my
duck about it and if my duck is off doing duck things
i'll talk to bob about it right and i literally say out loud the steps i want
to do and then often like once that idea solidifies right
once the idea solidifies then i actually write it out so i write out what i'm
going to have happen in just plain english before i actually
write out any code any syntax if you can learn to do this skill well
it will be one of the most impactful things on your career folks that write
good pseudo code write good code and so you want to get better at this idea of

02:04
thinking through any challenge i don't care how small it is you want to think
through the steps in plain language before ever thinking about any code
too many folks at this stage dive right into javascript they get lost they
forget some syntax and then all right so you want to you want to
have a clear direction before going into your code you can still be a baddie and
write bad code but you need some direction right to be a baddie right and
so that's what pseudocode gives us it gives us direction
this used to be one of my favorite classes to teach in person so in person
i used to have my students build a robot that would make peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches except i was the robot and they had to write out pseudo code
that would enable me to eat a sandwich it's actually really hard it's really

02:05
difficult i taught that class 40 50 times and i only ever ate a sandwich twice
and one of them right one of them cheated right so out of like 40 50 times i ran
that class only i only ever ate a sandwich once
legitimately because it's really hard you got to think about hold on i'm going
to do something real quick you ready watch it slow i'm going to get big here
for you ready think about everything that just had to happen for that to work
right my left hand had to go reach out for the mug i had to pick up the mug i
had to go until it hit my lips then i had to tilt it then the drink had to
come out i had to go into my mouth i had to tilt my head back a little bit so i

02:06
didn't die but all those things imagine if you had to write the code for
that to work right imagine if you had to break down
all these things because remember a computer will do what you tell it to
do and so if you wanted a robot to do everything i just did you would have to
write the code to make it happen and so i always used to make my students write
out this code we didn't write it in javascript so it actually wrote it in
pseudocode and i would give them a lot of things like i was a robot that could
see colors shapes um they had to figure out how to do movement things like that
right and so it actually takes a really long time to
break down all the steps it would take to build a peanut butter jelly sandwich
to get me to eat it and to not die everybody's like what how'd they cheat
how they cheat so one team cheated by using the stuff i just showed you in
the angry parent simulator they wrote some code that said

02:07
using the speech synthesis or something similar to it back then uh that said
well first they figured out how to make me point and i'm gonna i'm giving a
little bit of my apologies this is actually what happened not something i
would say without this happening so they made me point at somebody on their team
and then they programmed me to say make me a sandwich b word
and then that person got up made the peanut butter and jelly
sandwich they put it in my mouth they like made my head chew and then they
like tilted my head back and and helped me swallow it without dying
so did they actually program a robot that made a peanut butter jelly sandwich
no but did they accomplish it they did and whenever i taught that class going
forward i had to give a disclaimer that you were not allowed to do that anymore
so it was brilliant but it didn't solve the problem it was a good loophole
so that's how they cheated now for our pseudo code
i want to attempt to write some pseudo code for our

02:08
temperature converter so i'm going to open up the temperature converter first
and then we're going to take some time to think through some pseudo code
all right let me close this let me open up temperature converter
temperature converter html javascript you'll notice that
there's no javascript here right what i want to be able to do
what i want to be able to do is i want to be able to enter in a value right
have that value be converted from celsius to fahrenheit
right and then i want to see that value in the dom
right so that's what i want for a temperature converter i want something

02:09
that can convert a value from celsius to fahrenheit okay now i want you to take
two minutes to think through the steps that have to happen
for that conversion to happen right so i want you to think through the
pseudocode don't think in terms of javascript don't even think about in
terms of like the math to make this happen i just want you to think through
the steps we're gonna have to do to get some value and convert it okay
all right so i'm gonna put two minutes on the clock i want you to think through
your pseudocode and write out your pseudocode in your main.js here
put two minutes on the clock think through it and we're going to go
over it together i want you to make a temperature converter celsius to
fahrenheit what are the steps that you would need in just plain language
that you would need to make this work and then we're gonna

02:10
go over together two minutes okay take two minutes
the steps i don't care about code you don't have to code to do this what are
the steps you would need for any type of conversion to happen go to weather.com
nice one panda wispy tv thank you for the engagement

02:11
folks are done that's all right jim this is class 13 that's why
not class 12 wrong folder all right give yourself about 35 more
seconds and then we're going to come back and go over it together
that's pretty cool joy a lot of folks coming in done that's cool

02:12
have i met eric dr thomas in person no i haven't yet i would love to though
all right folks come on back let's look at this together
all right let's think in plain language what we need to have happen to turn
celsius into fahrenheit right so let's say we have
uh zero degrees celsius we want that to be
32 degrees fahrenheit right that's the celsius to fahrenheit conversion
so if i want to turn something from celsius to fahrenheit what's the first
thing i need if i want to turn something from celsius
to fahrenheit what's the first thing i need
i need the value that's in celsius right i need i need something in celsius like

02:13
i i need the value that is in let's say cell c
yes right i need the value that is in celsius right
if i don't have it in celsius i can't do anything right i need the value if i'm
going to convert something from celsius to fahrenheit i need something in
celsius right i think we don't don't big brain it
right don't big brain it don't be like oh i got to get the input and then i
take the value out but no i'm going to convert something from
celsius to fahrenheit i need something in celsius great so i need the value
that is in celsius once i have the value that's in celsius what do i need to do
i need to convert it right i need to convert it convert from celsius to bear in

02:14
height oh sorry spelled it wrong there you go i need this i need i need
to convert it from celsius to fahrenheit right
all right so i got the value that was in celsius
i'm going to convert the celsius into fahrenheit and then once i have this new
value that's in fahrenheit what do i do what do i need to do
yeah i need to like show it show it boom there we go
so i need to like get the value that's in celsius
i need to convert it from celsius to fahrenheit and then i need to like show it
now the cool thing is we've done all of these steps already so if you go
back and look at the examples we've done today and on
thursday of last week we have done each and every single one of these steps so

02:15
i'm gonna put five minutes on the timer and i want you to try and build out this
actual conversion right five minutes on the timer i want
you to try it because remember you're not coding you're playing with legos
go and find the other legos that enable you to pull something out to get a value
find the lego that's going to enable you to like actually reassign a variable
find the lego that's going to actually enable you to
put it back into the dom right see if you can go back and find those pieces
and plug them in you're not coding anything really from scratch you're
gonna have to find the formula but there's nothing really from scratch here
go and find those pieces and plug them in
i'm gonna put five minutes on the clock here
and actually try and code this now if you're saying leon i have no idea what

02:16
to do how do i do ah play with legos go look at other lego bricks
see if you can bring those legos to this bit of code and see if you can do it
there's there's no wrong or right way to do this you're just gonna go grab other
legos and use them that's it try playing with legos
there's nothing in the html exactly you're gonna have to go get those lego
pieces as well you're gonna need an input you're gonna
need a button to click you're gonna need a place to put it in the dom
we've seen all those pieces already tonight you got it i believe in you
you can't be lost you're on a roller coaster you're in you're exactly where
you need to be you're on the seat you're strapped in you're hurtling into

02:17
the unknown but you're exactly where you need to be you're not lost
play with some legos on the way down this is a strange roller coaster i agree
we're trying to do actual code now we did our pseudocode now let's try to do
some actual code good morning happy tree aaliyah so hard to hear that but uh
future you will be way happier usually hey glad to hear it

02:18
is that a play on musubi like the food musube
means you're trying to do both you're going to try and find it and then put it
in the right spot yeah okay first i need an input then i
need a function to convert exactly that's cool mr bae i love it that's cool brew

02:19
dab get out of here dab [Music] joshua's so hard but it pays the bills
does it not does it not anything what if google foo found us the
code that already did it i mean in practice that's a good idea but when
you're learning yeah let's try and use the building blocks we already have
that's like that's like you don't want to always go and get more bricks you
want to you want to play with the bricks that you already have too
i can do this but i need more time that's okay all right get where you can
we're only going one way right now ivy but if you want to take on that
challenge you can i feel like i lost my bricks a sometimes

02:20
when you're on a roller coaster you drop a few of them
i assigned a variable no idea what to do now hey it's a good start
what am i having for dinner i don't know yet dominoes
vegan buffalo nugs there you go all right folks come on back i know that's funny

02:21
good joshua joke all right folks come on back let's take a look at this together
all right come on back come on back let's take a peek alrighty so
like i said we're going to go and get pieces from other stuff
uh so let's let's do our let's look at the angry parents that's the angry
parent simulator this thing we looked at most recently
let's go and take a look at that i want to look at the html first
html has everything that i need here right is there anything that i would
need extra that's not already here in the in the um
anchor parent simulator no we got the form we got the button and we got the
place to put it so i'm just going to copy this
and when i come to our temperature converter i'm just going to paste it
except i don't need all of them i just need one right so
i'm going to give this the label of celsius so see yes there we go

02:22
and um we'll give it the id name of celsius as well
i'm gonna give it the idea of cell and i'm just gonna put in here cell cs
value cool that's our form right we we grab make sure that celsius
it's an input that has the idea of cell all right id of cell
and um we have a button i'm going to change this button to oh
we're going to keep it yell who cares and then i have h2 place dl
if the screen's blurry that's you got to make sure that you use the right
settings go ahead and do the quality settings you can change it to what you
want uh you can also refresh sometimes that helps no
cool all right so now we got everything we need we got a place to put the
celsius value we got the button the click that will help us with the conversion

02:23
and i have a place to like put the converted value in cool
that's kind of all i'm going to need for the for for this to work because i'm
gonna need to get a value i'm gonna need
to convert it and i'm gonna need to show it so i'm actually gonna go back and
look at the angry parent simulator again i'm gonna look at the javascript this
time and all right here's what i need right like i need this event listener
i want to copy that that's that's how i'm going to kick all this stuff off right
and i'm going to need a function but what am i trying to do here i'm not
trying to run i'm not trying to run i wanna this this this application is
doing something all right this application is doing something yeah
i'm converting right so maybe i'm going to call it convert
right so instead of run i'm going to call it convert just uh
i don't know make it a little bit more easy to read and then i need this run

02:24
here right like this run i'm going to copy this
but i don't actually need all this stuff so i'm gonna paste it and
i'm gonna get rid of pretty much everything that's in here um
boom all right actually let's just get rid of everything at first
all right so i just have that place for my function right
all right it's just it's just taken from what we've already seen right
since i'm calling it convert what do i have to change
what do i have to change if i'm calling it convert would i have to change
i gotta change the name i gotta change this from run
to convert right so that way they match right because
the name of the function should match the function that you're calling or
running right that's the link there and so we're gonna do is we're gonna
listen for a click on yell when we here we're gonna run
these sets of instructions and the cool thing is we have our
instructions here that came from our pseudo code that can kind of like plop

02:25
in and i'm not starting from scratch right like i was going to follow my
instructions that i got from my pseudo code
and so this is the beauty of pseudo code early on your pseudo code can be turned
into your comments so these remember these are called comments the computer
won't read them they're just there for you and other developers that you're
working with and so if you write good pseudo code you wind up with good comments
later on we'll talk about like clean code and best practice and all that crap
but for now i love comments in my code because it helps me stay on track on the
things i said i was going to do all right i need the value that is in celsius
right i need the value that is in celsius so
i need to get the value from the input have we seen a way to get a value out of

02:26
an input before yeah we've seen that like a dozen times already
uh let's just grab one here yoink copy all right boom
get the value out of an input um but our input is not first name what
was our input our input had the id of cell let's go back let's change this from
first name to so beautiful so now i'm getting the value out of cell
and storing it in a variable called fname what should i call this variable would
be a better thing to call this variable temp yeah i like that
like temp short for temperature right that's the temp that we got
so we got the value out of celsius and we stored it in temp

02:27
what do we need to do at temp now gotta do some quick match right we gotta
convert it the temperature from celsius to fair in height
we gotta do some math so i'm gonna i'm just gonna do reassignment right i'm
gonna set temp to be equal to right wait a minute can i do this
can i reassign tep to be something else why not why can't i reassign it const
let's change that to let and let's go am i right let's go all right so temp
all right temp is now able to be reassigned because
it's no longer cons so we're going to do temp and we'll do our quick math so
we'll do temp equals temp and i see some folks throwing in i'm

02:28
going to trust you all temp times 9 divided by 5. i don't even
know this works i'm just trusting y'all plus 32.
great that was that was the quick maths all right so we got the value out of the
input we converted the value from celsius to fahrenheit
what's the last thing we have to do oh our studio already says it show it
we've already seen how to put stuff into
the dom already let's go back let's look at angry parent simulator
um inner text document place dl inner text equals and copy that boom and
instead of it just being equal to what what am i going to set this equal to
temp yeah that's our variable all right let's see if this wild thing works

02:29
all right let's make a little bit bigger all right our celsius value let's do
zero hit yell boom 32 that works nice uh let's do a hundred that should be 112.
sorry 212. boom working first try let's go we're a team i loved it all right now
we're gonna walk through it and talk through all the things but did i use
anything that we had not seen before we have seen every single bit of this
already first thank you zaku thank you we've seen every single bit of this
except for like the math right but like you could have just done anything you
could have just added five to it to see if it works right like if you didn't do
this math the first thing you could have done is like just plus five
right and then if you're if you're just adding five to numbers the only thing

02:30
you'd have to come back and fix is the math so a lot of times if i know i'm
gonna have to go and find something else i'll just put a placeholder in
and then come back and actually do the math later on or whatever else i need
later on right so you didn't have to start with the exact conversion math you
could have just made something up for now to get the bulk of the problem
working and then just come back and fix it but everything i literally copy and
paste it from other stuff that we've already done i grabbed the form i
grabbed the button i grabbed the h2 right
i grabbed my event listener i grabbed my sets of instructions or my function i
grabbed how to get the value out of the dom i grabbed how to do reassignment i
grabbed how to put stuff back into the dom so you have all of these

02:31
building blocks right we have all these building blocks right that if you commit
to putting these blocks into memory and commit to playing with them deleting
them re-combining them in different ways you can do
a lot of really cool stuff already but it starts with your pseudo code
before you do any other homework that's coding related in this program before
you write any other programs always write your pseudo code
this would have been way harder if we did not write any pseudo code
i like to play a game with myself right i like to play a game every once
in a while if i'm bored the game i play is pseudocode i know it sounds silly but
it's true when i was in the t i would play pseudocode i was like what would i
need to do right what would i need to do right
to flip that book upside down and the person not realize it

02:32
and i would sit there like all right first first i gotta cause a distraction
then i gotta i gotta kick them in the shin
right like and you just you just think through it right
but that's the idea the idea is that this pseudo code will change the game
before you do any coding projects please think through your pseudo code
i say one more time i've shown you a lot of code
showing a lot of building blocks lots of legos you have to in between classes
in between getting your homework done you have to play
with the legos none of this will ever click none of this will ever sink in
unless you try to build stuff right we saw some amazing projects from
folks that just said i wonder if i could make a nail polish picker

02:33
i i wonder if i could right do a mortal kombat changer right
it starts with a what if it starts with the playing it starts with the having
fun we are all on a roller coaster playing with legos have some fun with it
and when you get stuck ask good questions on discord all right
good question discord i don't understand how this event listener works i i i
don't get why my event listener's not working here's my code here's what i'm
doing it's not happening right play and if you get stuck ask questions alrighty
really important question you'll get all my code at the end of end
of class of course i will share my solutions so if you need the code you'll
get it uh what is the best tv show of all time

02:34
go ahead and throw your answers in chat so far you are all wrong
i'm seeing lost i'm seeing euphoria i'm seeing the wire i'm seeing brooklyn
nine-nine little britain that's a good one
dragon ball z seinfeld fringe no wrong wrong wrong rick and morty wrong how
much mother wrong community wrong still pierce or wrong firefly wrong
all great shows breaking bad wrong game of thrones definitely wrong
soft bark wrong if you drama wrong succession wrong
all right you're all kind of just steaming out here uh the correct answer is
the bachelor the best television of all time is hands down the bachelor now
in honor of bachelor nation bachelor nation uh the rest of our

02:35
examples this evening will all be bachelor's related in an attempt to sway you
into following the best tv show of all time so
let's go ahead and do some more code and i'm going to ask you to open up the
starter code that is labeled bachelor so let's go ahead and i'm going
to close all this stuff that we're doing here all this inferior code and we're
going to open up bachelor code so in uh bachelor code you're going to see
that there are three folders all right we lost some viewers it's all right
they'll come back soon enough all right we have three different folders
the first folder we're going to open up and do that one first so there's an
index.html there's a javascript file so let's go ahead and open up
this this html file and here you'll notice that we have contestants from
juan pablo season of the bachelor now juan pablo season of the bachelor is

02:36
hands down one of the greatest the greatest runs of television ever made
right it is hands down the most controversial season of the bachelor and
it is the most controversial season of the bachelor for one very particular
reason anybody know why juan pablo season uh was one of the most controversial
seasons not only of of the bachelor history but of all pelvis all cinematic
and television history of all time some of you got it uh it is one of the
greatest runs of television of all time uh because in the end he did not propose
he gave nikki the rose and it was kind of like we could still do this thing if
you want but we ain't getting married yet it blew
everyone's mind it was it was it was it was a it was the the the travesty of all
travesties and it made for one of the greatest buildups of all television

02:37
history so here we have three contestants
on juan pablo season of the bachelor we have claire who kind of went on to
become a bachelorette but had the own controversy because
she like met her boo like first class and i mean first first class uh first
first episode and like didn't want to do the rest of the season so that was
interesting uh nikki who ultimately won juan pablo season a bachelor pediatric
nurse very interesting person um but didn't get the proposal
and then we have charlene the second love of my life my wife is
aware of this it's my wife and then it's
charlene we're cool with it it's okay uh
and so we had all these individuals that were on juan pablo season of the
bachelor right but nikki was the only one
right was the only one that got the rose so what i want to happen right

02:38
what i want to have happen is when you click on final rows
i want claire to go away and i unfortunately want charlene to go away
and i only want nikki to be left right to be left
on the page because she is the only one that got the final rose so if we look at
our code this evening you will see that there are three images one for claire
one for nikki and one for charlene and in our javascript we have some code
for you to fill in where you see insert code i need you to
actually insert some code and what should happen is when you click final
rows claire goes away unfortunately charlene goes away and we're left with
just nikki so i'm gonna put two quick minutes on the clock here and i want you
to try your best two minutes and then we'll go over it together

02:39
all right have at it excuse me didn't even open vs code yet
i nominate leon for the batch i think my wife would have a an issue with it
we could try though we'll see what happens nikki was the one in the middle
the pediatric nurse laughs all right folks minute left minute left
and we're gonna go over it do you listen to charlene's podcast

02:40
of course i mean i listened i was i followed their blog for the longest time
until they kind of like stopped it it was a great read so charlene used to
recap all of bachelor nation stuff uh it was always it's something i looked
forward to a lot 30 seconds left getting a lot of duns seen a lot of fresh trey

02:41
nice all right folks let's take a look at this together all right so
when we click on the h1 that has the idea final rows
we want claire and charlene to go away but nikki should stay so we notice that
the h1 has the idea final rows so what do we have to do here this is an event
listener so what do we have to put in here
what what goes in this insert code here what goes in there
yeah the name of the set of instructions
the name of that function is called hide right we can see that it's called hide
we want to run hide when they click on that final rows
and the set of instructions has two things that it wants it to do we want to
style display none so the cool thing here is that you can
look at something in the dom and then you can change its style like

02:42
the css right you can change the css to be display none remember when you
display none something it removes it from the dom right it's no longer in the
dom you can't see it it's not there it's not taking up space so if we look
nicky sorry nikki has an idea of nikki so we'll stay away from that but idea of
claire and idea of charlene should be all we need so if we go in
we say all right i want the id of claire and then i want the id of charlene
all right so what should happen now is when we click on the final rows
claire should be set to display none and charlene should be set to display
none i can't bring myself to do it let's just comment that line out
and then let's go back let's refresh click on final rows boom claire went away
right claire went away but uh nikki and charlene stayed right if we refresh the

02:43
dom gets repainted right the dom gets repainted right
you click on final rows boom claire goes away nikki charlene are left cool and
just for folks that need the uh the code afterwards i'll get rid of my comment
alrighty let's take a look at the next one all right so bachelor code number two
i'm going to open up the html again i'm going to open up the javascript again
and if we look i'm going to open this in the browser uh you have the choice
over who the next bachelorette should have been
it was very clear that charlene should have been the next bachelorette it
didn't happen claire technically got their chance later on and then andy was
the next bachelorette um assistant district attorney from atlanta
like it was it was an okay season but they they made the wrong decision at the

02:44
end right they just made like one of the worst pics
in bachelor history right so what i want you to be able to do is
to choose who the next bachelorette should have been when you click on andy
i want andy's photo to show up right when you click on claire i want claire's
photo to show up right you click on charlene which you
should you want charlene's photo to show up so i want you to be able to pick who
the next bachelorette should have been if we notice
there's the text that we're clicking on andy next clairneck charlene next are
the ids and then there are the images down here that we can't see at the
beginning so what i want you to do is i want you to take a few minutes
and see if you can get andy's photo to show up claire's photo
to show up and charlene's photo to show up when you click on them i'm gonna go
ahead and put another i know this will be quick just two

02:45
minutes and we're gonna go over it together so i don't expect you to finish
it in two minutes but go ahead and try remember the goal is when you click on
andy you see their photo if you click on claire you see their photo you click on
charlie and you see their photo go ahead and give it a shot
two minutes we're gonna go over it together
zuma make sure you saved and that you refreshed
no megan i was in in andy's season i was a fan of nick

02:46
and i think she made the wrong decision in the end of that season alrighty
what do you think about lindsay a few years ago
so i've i i have trouble visualizing people's faces i'm blanking on their season
i'll think once i see a picture of them i'll be able to put it two and two
are you so i always wait until seasons are done before i watch any of them and
i normally give them a little bit of time i used to watch in the moment and
kind of like be really into like the blogs and stuff like that but now i kind
of wait until the end just for for time's sake you watch bachelor in
paradise bathroom paradise is the best version of the
bachelor although the little unknown bachelor winter games was interesting

02:47
but bachelor in paradise is the best all right folks come on back come on back
let's take a look at this together alrighty so
we want to be able to click on these names
right the andy the claire the charlene and see some photos why
are there no photos when the page loads why can't i see
the photos when the page loads yeah if we look look all the images have a class

02:48
of hidden where can i check to see more about this class of hidden
where can i go to see this class of hidden yeah let's take a look at the css
boom all right so in the css we have this class of hidden
right so it's this class right it's this class that is removing
or doing the display nut so if we got rid of the class right
right if we got rid of the class we should be able to see the photos right
if we look we see that they all have hidden by default
so we are able to get rid of that class then we should probably be able to see
the photo so let's take a look let's look at andy's first so
here i did something where where were variables this is like the first time we
get to see a variable be useful so here i did document.queryselectorandy

02:49
so i am looking at the html and i'm grabbing this image
right i'm selecting the image from the dom and i'm saying
query document.queryselector andy and i'm storing it in the variable andy
why the heck would i do that why would i like look in the dom find the image and
store it as a variable why would i do that yeah
so i can reuse it over and over and over again without having to say
document.querysectorandy document that queryselectorandy.comcreatorsector.nd
right i can go down here and i can just say andy
right if i just say andy down here what i'm really saying is go into the
document find the image that has the idea of andy right but i'm just storing
it in this variable called andy so that my code looks way cleaner down here

02:50
right when we talked about kind of being dry do not repeat yourself and so this
cuts down on me having to say document.queryselector over and over and
over and over again i just stored it in a variable called andy right
all right so let's let's click on andy so document that query selector andy
next that's the text remember if we look here is the text of andy next right so
that's the text that we're clicking on so here's here's the text we're going to
click on it we have an event listener and that event listener should call what
function what function should this call what's the name of the function
yeah if we look the name of the function is called andy next but we should type
in andy next beautiful andy next all right now when
when we click on the text and we run that function andy next we just clicked
on andy what do we want to do to clear what do we want to declare if we're

02:51
clicking on andy should claire be visible no so how can we make sure that claire
is not visible what what what class can we give them
yeah we can add that hidden class right we can add the hidden class and
the reason why we want to make sure that we add the hidden class to claire
and make sure we want to add it to charlene is because we don't know
if claire charlene are already visible right we could be somewhere else in our
code where we had just clicked on claire and claire was visible right so we want
to make sure if we're clicking on andy we want to be super clear that claire is
gone and charlene is gone right but what do we want to make sure with

02:52
with andy what do we want to do to andy what are we going to toggle hidden
so you're like leon what the heck is all this mean what does all this mean well
remember with javascript we can mess with classes we can add and remove
classes that means we can add or move classes to that dom right we can add or
remove classes to the dom and so here what i'm saying is a find claire which is
the image right remember the image and give it the class of hidden
right add the class of hidden then find charlene the image of charlene right and
add the class of hidden all right now toggle what do you think toggle means
toggle is the same thing as a light switch right if the light is on

02:53
right if the light is on and you hit the switch light goes off all right
if i hit the switch again light comes on right so it toggles on and off
right and so the cool thing here is if it already has hidden
it's going to remove it if it doesn't have hidden it's going to
add it that's what the toggle means on and off let's take a look let's save
this and see where we're at come back let's refresh let's click on andy
nothing happened oh no nothing happened i refreshed
nothing happened let's go back let's take a look did i do everything right
all right andy next what am i missing oh you know what

02:54
all this other stuff is probably given us an issue because we haven't fixed it
yet let's actually open up the inspector if we can see anything in here
let's take a look go to the console unexpected token on line 16. the
inspector's saying hey there's an error that you have unexpected token line 16.
you see main.js line 16. let's go look at line 16.
it does not like our code here right it doesn't like the code here we haven't
filled it in yet so it's like oh there's errors there's issues
let's comment this out and let's comment out these two things as well
right so now it's just the code that we wrote
right now it's just the code that we've worked on so far
let's go back let's refresh and now let's click on andy
beautiful andy's photo comes and if i click again andy's photo goes

02:55
away let's look in the dom and see what's happening
so here are here are the images right here are the images right
look at andy look right here right look specifically at this class when i click
on the text of andy when i click on andy for the first time
what's going to happen to that class when i click on annie what's going to
happen to that class it's going to toggle off it's going to
it's already there so the toggle's going to remove it
boom it's gone so that hidden class is gone if the hidden class is gone we can
see the image now if i click if i click andy again what's going to
happen to that class we're going to add it back so right i'm

02:56
going to click three two one boom we can see that hidden class come back
and as soon as that hidden class comes back andy's photo goes away
right so what i have done is i have set up an event listener
so that when i click i am either adding hidden
or removing hidden now the other thing here is that claire and charlene are
also getting the class hidden but does it matter no because they already have
the class of hidden right if we look we're saying
we're saying give claire hidden we're saying give charlene hidden it just
doesn't matter because they already have the class of hidden right
but for andy we're toggling that on and off cool
all right let's go ahead and do the next one for claire
actually we're going to do both of them at the same time let's go ahead and
uncomment this we know that this should be clarinets

02:57
cool because that's the name of the claire function down here
and this one is called charlene next so we can fill in that event listener as
well let's go and do charlene next beautiful
darlene next and then let's make sure that our our functions are working well so
if we're clicking on clear andy should be what andy should get what
what should andy get for clicking on claire hidden yep should get hidden
all right and charlene should get what as well same thing right
darlene should get hidden beautiful and then andy i'm sorry clear

02:58
is the one that should be toggled all right a little toggle hidden there
that's all folks are saying is there a way to make this dryer there is but
we're not there yet all right and the last one for charlene we'll do the same
thing again if we're clicking on charlene then andy should go away
so we'll do the hidden here for for andy and then we'll also do it on clear
it should be hidden and then the last thing we have to do is
make sure that charlene is the one that is getting the toggle
now some folks are saying hey leon why don't you need to do dot hidden like
since it's a class well you've already told it that it's a class here so you
don't need the dot inside of here cool all right let's save all this stuff
and let's go to town let's go ahead and see what we got
all right let's open up the the dom here

02:59
see we can see these these lovely images you can see to start off they all have
hidden and let's click on charlene all right charlene's lovely photo pops
up you can see that charlene is now missing the class hidden
and here's the cool thing if i go over and i click on claire right away boom
you can see that charlene gets hidden but claire gets the toggle
right claire gets the toggle and so the cool thing is you can jump now between
each person right you can jump between each person
and it'll hide if the other ones are already visible so if i go to andy i
know that claire and charlene are going to get hidden only claire's showing
right now but i'm going to try and hide both and then show andy
we also have the toggle right so we can toggle andy away as well right
so we can do the toggle all day we can then jump between different ones
and know that as we jump to each person the other ones will hide and we can

03:00
still toggle on the people that we're at pretty nifty all right
one more and then we're at we'll end class one more example then we're going
to end class let's go ahead and take a look at number three
and close all these here number three i'm going to open this in the browser
all right so chat let's uh make sure that uh we've all
been paying attention in juan pablo season of the bachelor who ends up with the
rose who has the final rose in juan pablo season of the bachelor
wonderful nikki is the one that has the rose so what i want to have happen
is if you click on nikki it should show her wonderful photo

03:01
and if you click on claire it should alert wrong
right so nikki lovely photo claire wrong and so let's go and take a look at
this code there are some you can see that there
there is there are two contestants one with claire and one nikki you'll notice
that only nikki has the class of rose right both of them have the class of
contestant but only thank you mmb but only nikki has the class of rose so
what i want you to do is to write some code that's going to enable only
nikki's photo to show and they click on claire to say wrong i'm going to put two
minutes on the clock we're going to go over it together and
then we'll do a raid and end up class all right go ahead two minutes try it
remember you don't have to know anything that's happening in this code base
just use the building blocks you've already seen

03:02
don't get hung up on the syntax don't get hung up on new stuff being thrown at
you do what you know how to do fix the things that you know how to fix
milk thank you for the hydration cheers to you got a minute left change
now i said boom 30k channel points baby steps to a milli in new york i'm really

03:03
in my stop from these ops a lot of done it's nice
a lot of dones okay okay see you 30 seconds and then we're gonna go over
it together sometimes the playlist just gets it right
all right folks come on let's go over this one together

03:04
and then we'll wrap up with a raid all right let's look at this one
alrighty so we want to be able to click on clear and see wrong
click on nikki and see their lovely photo so if we look there's some wild
sauce going on in here right first we're saying document query selector all
so we've only seen query selector so far right like we see query selector here
what do you think query selector all enables us to do yeah
enables us to grab all of them right everything that has a specific what
we're just going to use a class let's go ahead and use the class contestants

03:05
right we look we have the class oh it's contestant not no s contestant
right so let's just copy to make sure we spelled it right contestant
right and so that's gonna enable us to grab all of the elements
that have that class right grab all the elements that have
that class now here we have some fancy pants code don't worry about this code
for now what this enables us to do is it enables us to put a smurf
on every single thing that had the class of contestant
right this fancy pants code enables us to plop smurfs on every single thing
that had that class all right so if we're gonna put a smurf
on we're gonna make sure that whenever we click on any of those things that
have that class we're going to run what function
what function are we going to run what function we're going to run

03:06
cool check for rows exactly beautiful and so now if we just save
this what we have right now is we have selected everything that had the class
contestant which means that both claire and nicky are now selected because they
both had the class contestant and with this line of code we've made
sure that both of them have this click event
tied to it they both have the same smurf same type of smurf listening for that
that that click and so what we're gonna see is we're going to say hey
the thing that we just clicked on right that's that's what we're saying
the thing click.target the thing that we just clicked on
does it have the class of what what are we looking for the thing we just clicked
on does it have the class of what rose exactly looking for the class of rose
we're seeing if it has the class of rows we've already said that we're looking

03:07
for a class so do we need the dot no we already said we're looking for a class
we're saying hey the thing the click.target is the thing
we just clicked on does it have the class of rows if it does we know that
we've clicked on nikki and we should toggle the hidden class
right we should toggle the hidden class right
we see that nikki by default has the class of hidden so we should toggle that
hidden class and if it doesn't have the rows we know that it's not nikki right
right we know it's not nikki so we should alert rom let's go ahead and save it
all right it's going to save it let's see if it works
clicked on claire we got the alert of wrong
click on nikki we get our lovely photo a lot of folks are saying leon why don't
you need the dot hidden here well we don't because we've already sorry we've
already said that it's a class class list we don't need the dot here

03:08
because we already said that it's a class up here there's nothing to say that
we're talking about a class so we needed the dot yeah all right
i know this is a lot i know i threw a lot of code at you but
there's something i need you to do between now and next class and that is
what what do i need you to do between now and next class
i need you exactly i need you to play with it i've we've talked about a lot of
lego bricks there are a lot of legos here on the table that i need you to
play with break try and understand how they come
together try and put them together in different ways no
there should be nothing in you that says i don't get this
there's nothing to get about legos you're going to try and play with them
you're going to re-type everything out you're going to delete it you're going
to retype you're going to delete it redo it type it you're going to do it over
and over again you're going to play you're going to break and move it around
