00:00
next week is allreact the week after we start the hunt we have data structures
algorithms Big O notation and then everything we need to do to be
successful in the job hunt so buckling folks next couple of weeks are
going to be wonderful uh we got a lot of wonderful stuff planned a lot of things
that are going to help you cross that finish line but the big piece the thing
that we need to get done is the MVP so when we are going into the job hunt we
want to have a hundred hours project a project that we have sunk a hundred
hours into to complete and when we're in our interviews we can say hey this is
something I built right this is something I built this is something that

00:01
was something I wanted to to bring into this world right and I did it now the
MVP is the minimum viable product the simplest version of that idea that can
convey what you want to have happen to your users and the the full MVP is is a
way of taking that 100 hours project right of taking that hundred dollars
project and Distilling it into something smaller a little bit more manageable
right a little bit more manageable that you can get done in a shorter time frame
and then continue to sync your hours into right so I'm going to show you an MVP
that I think looks decent that well looks good and
um was from one of our alumni and we're going to talk through it and then I'll
answer some questions and then I'm going to show you some other things we can do
uh to get your MVPs across the Finish Line in time all right

00:02
uh so here's uh Nicholas levino's they're now a software engineer at ciao
now which is kind of like a food delivery competitor right and so they
have uh spilled the tea with us here on uh Discord uh Daddy Yankee for those
that remember them from the first cohort
and this was the app that they built for
their MVP of their 100 hours project and it's funny because you think about your
100 hours project as being something right as being something that can tie
what you did to your future right so a lot of times a hundred hours project
right A lot of times 100 hours project can
um can help explain what you were doing before and be the bridge into what
you're doing in the future or you can even tie things you were doing recently

00:03
Nicholas got a client that was a chef right so they had a freelancing the
freelancing client they got was a chef so they built out a wonderful website
for this Chef then their 100 hours project was food related right
and then they got a job at ciao now which is also in the food space so you
can kind of see how the building blocks are there to be a good fit for a company
like child now right they had a good freelancing client
they had a good 100 hours project that was in the same vein and then that
opened them up to an opportunity at a company like ciao now right it was able
to connect exactly the dots and so I really like this because you can sign up
nice beautiful photo on the front nice beautiful font on the front nothing too
complicated here remember like if you're thinking like

00:04
um MVP right if you're thinking like um something simple
right you don't have to go wild nothing too too big on the front page when you
log in um same login should look a little similar here folks you look a little
similar here should look a little similar here folks and you log in
and the beautiful thing is you can upload recipes right and so you can
upload your recipes you can tag them with the country you can view the recipe
right and then in the recipe you have um kind of the ingredients the
directions you can like it and you can save it right so the extension here is
they they built on right they built on what we had covered in class but made it
their own right right they made it their own they

00:05
made it so that it was not a social media post but a recipe post they made
it so that it you had the directions they made it so you still had the core
functionality that we had there like the liking and stuff but they also had a
favoring feature and so now I can explore all the recipes I can go to my
favorite recipes which are bookmarked I don't know why my LastPass is freaking
out I can go to my recipes that I uploaded and I can add a recipe right
it's gonna start slowing down because there's probably a lot of us on it now
but um I can add my recipe I can see what country it comes from I can say the
different dish types I can add descriptions ingredients directions
upload files right and so it's not it it it's not
a wild leap from what we did with binary upload boom but they made it their own
they tied it to their story right and they kept it simple there's nothing here

00:06
that we haven't done right they extended it to be something that was meaningful
to their story something that they could
use as they kind of go into the hunt and there's not a lot here there's no fancy
styling it looks clean it looks crisp uh it has the ability to do some really
interesting features and it's just a good way of building out an MVP and so
you can see that they're still not even like text right uh they're still like
they did they didn't worry about going like they didn't worry about they didn't
stress over the copy I see so many folks when they start building out their MVP
they're stressing the text no stress the functionality right stress how you're
going to extend what we do a binary upload boom to be something that you
want to create right and so this had all of the trappings of binary upload boom
but all the little bit extras to make it their own
right and so this is what I what I really like right the idea here this is

00:07
a simple MVP it had a a few extra bits of functionality which was like the the
favoriting right it had a slight modification what we already did which
was instead of it being a social media post it's a recipe and directions uh and
even on the explore page you saw that they kind of changed up the um
right you saw that they they kind of changed what like was showing for the
Post right so this is like the feed but they add some extra stuff they add in
the usernames um they add in like these little Flags
which I really like right and so this is just an MVP they got a job before they
finish this right like they they didn't need to keep
work they got the job so they got the job pretty quickly and so this was their

00:08
MVP and with the MVP they got the job huh EP
got the job it's almost like we're gonna start the hunt with just our MVP being
done and then as we're in the hunt we'll finish our
our 100 projects hmm almost like that could be a possibility
just saying all right all right and so the idea here is right
like you don't have to do the most for your MVP think about what you want to
build slight incremental changes keep the styling clean add your little touch
to it and that's a good MVP oh uh this is on Heroku
um right now I think most folks are on Heroku next week I'm gonna I keep saying
I'm gonna push it but I really am trying to wheel and deal here uh there are

00:09
plenty of alternatives to Heroku that you can explore on your own I'm probably
on Sunday for our super review going to kind of pick my choice for like projects
going forward cool what's wrong with paid Heroku it's paid
and we want to do everything for free here the whole point of this boot camp
is to help folks that were affected by the pandemic a lot of folks that lost
their job where money is very tight learn how to code and get a job that
takes them out of that situation so anything unfortunately that has a cost
is out the window for a hundred devs I will probably continue to pay for Heroku
amayan but it's not something I'm going to incorporate into my lessons because I
want it every single thing to be free oh uh laments if you're new here you could

00:10
definitely hang around we're going to be um jumping off very quick this is just
kind of like a quick wanted to show folks a few things before
they start working in a project night so if you're new here we often especially
towards the end of the program where we're at a lot of our nights become
building nights it makes no sense if you're learning to code please stop what
you're learning and build something with it it makes no sense to just learn and
then never apply it that's how you don't
actually learn how to code so what we do is we learned we spent the past couple
of weeks learning how to build full stack web applications with
authentication that had multiple wonderful collections that had all this
really rich functionality and now folks are taking all that code and expertise
that they learn and extending it into a project of their own design so that's
that's what we're doing so tonight I'm gonna stop talking very soon we're going
to jump on to another platform that we use called Remo where we can work

00:11
together we also use Discord exclamation point Discord and chat if you want to
join our Discord 40 plus thousand people on Discord now uh you can get all your
questions answered about learning how to code we have wonderful help channels so
yeah definitely join us there Daddy Yankee's in the chat hey how you
doing Daddy Yankee hey Daddy Yankee can we get you to come back and do another T
spill I think this cohort needs it as part of hunttober
the legend in chat let's go uh woven exclamation point unban
we'll take a look at it all right so for those that don't know what our tea

00:12
spills were last cohort as we got into like our Mega summer when we were kind
of doing the hunt um those were uh those those were kind
of where we brought in folks that already getting jobs and they told us
everything about kind of how they got the job how they secured it uh how how
what the boots on the ground take was for them getting a job so that's what I
loved about the Tea spills so many folks want to tell you about how to get a job
but that's something I can't the perspective I can't get you right the
perspective I can't give you is what it's like to be an entry-level Dev
getting a job right now so I like to bring in folks that are doing it in the
moment uh to tell you what their experience is like and the most
beautiful thing about the celebrations Channel right now is since I asked you

00:13
all to do it when folks get jobs they're they're they're they're putting
they're they're putting like they're putting like essays in that
celebration Channel about how they got the job what they studied who they
talked to there's dates on this stuff now like y'all are doing the most that's
why I was like this is getting ridiculous in the celebrations channel
right uh Curtis uh just just popped off in that celebrations Channel today right
so I love to see it I really appreciate everyone that does it so when you get
that job and you post the celebrations channel the more details the better
because we need to see how you're doing it right we want to see boots on the
ground experience how you're locking down these jobs what type of questions
people are asking right so that you're not just taking it from me the beautiful
thing I get to do is I do this all day long I talk to hundreds of folks getting
jobs I help hundreds of folks get jobs so I have a rough idea but nothing's
better than you seeing it straight from the people that are doing it and so that

00:14
celebrations Channel Wild all right Daddy Yankee's in for the
t-spill let's do it I'm excited all right um now Daddy Yankee just said in chat
that they use bootstrap uh so what you'll notice right what you'll notice
is that there was a like in in Daddy Yankee's kind of MVP
and in my kind of binary boom code it just looked decent like it looks decent
right out the gate because it's bootstrap right the beautiful thing
about Daddy Yankee's is that that like feed page looked great bootstrap right
and so bootstrap's been around for a while it's a quick way to just add some
simple styling to your site and I think for a lot of folks if they just use
bootstrap the the first MVP you make doesn't just look plain hot garbage
right bootstrap can make it look just a little bit beautiful without really

00:15
having to do too much uh all the cool kids these days are using things like
Tailwind um and so I just wanted to show real
quick like how easy Tailwind can be so um let's create a replet real quick
we'll do an HTML one and uh so Tailwind has a bunch of different
components that you can use and when we get to react next week you'll see like
how easy it is to use the components inside of react but even right now you
can just get the HTML code for each one and so if you go to their website they
have a bunch of free ones right on actual Tailwinds actual website and then
there's also sites like Daisy UI which are completely free so I just want to
show you how easy this is so if we just go to like their docs they give us like
a script to put in the head of our document so I'm going to copy that script

00:16
I'm gonna put it in the head of my HTML and then I can just literally go to this
hero and copy this hero put it in my in my uh body here
and I'm just gonna save it let it run and let's open this in a new window boom
like what like that was what three seconds and now
I have like this beautiful nav like a beautiful uh beautiful like H1 that I
could fill out buttons to get started and there's like other stuff on this
site too so if I go back to their components let's look at some like their
feature sections anything that doesn't have a lock on it is completely free so
let's just join this one let's look at the code yep copy I'm gonna go down here
all right paste it all right let's run it let's refresh

00:17
all right beautiful so it's completely responsive
uh it took it takes like three seconds and your site doesn't look like hot
garbage right uh it's a little weird running in the replet but uh so the
Tailwind could just be really speed up your development especially for an MVP
right this is this is this is an MVP your your design won't be complete your
style won't be complete you're trying to show the raw idea of what you're trying
to do when you extend binary upload boom right and so to make it just not look
ugly or not a hot mess you could just join these uh components and have a
really nice landing page have a really nice kind of uh different pieces
throughout your site um the unfortunate thing about their all
their components is that they're behind like a paywall uh so you'll notice that
some of them have like a lock so you can't use all of them but there are open

00:18
source versions as well um that where everything is completely open
um so Daisy UI we mentioned this I believe in the um
the office hours on Sunday but there's just all these components that are
completely free um so let's see how to use let's grab the CDN
I'm gonna put this at the top of my HTML file and of course like you would
optimize this it's just me going super fast and you know
demonstrations purpose so put that in there and then let's see what we can
grab from the UI here because these are all just open like none of them behind
our paywall or anything that's completely free um let's let's add a footer
all right here's some Footers uh I like this footer right here let's

00:19
grab the HTML boom let's go to end of our document here boom and let's run it
all right let's take a look over here uh did I put the actual Link in oh let's
run it again oh sorry I'm a little I still have a little bit of a cough uh use
install CDN I grabbed the right thing um I put it in the right spot let's see
so much we just copy and paste it I might have put it in the wrong spot

00:20
let me just undo that I put it inside the other script tag my bad grab this
there we go uh and then let's add that footer to the end put it over here
HTML yoink boom there we go run it beautiful now we got a beautiful a
beautiful footer all right that just that just looks good oh boy look at that
second try right and so this is what really like like a minute two minutes
and you have a landing page for your MVP
so there there the beauty of things like Tailwind is that uh one it can speed up
kind of like your CSS but there's also all these components that have already

00:21
been written for you specifically with like open source things like Daisy UI
and so when you're building out an MVP don't Focus please don't focus on how it
looks focus on your functionality and then grab some components from Tailwind
boom you're done that's your MVP then you'll take the rest of your 100 hours
to refine it right you'll take the rest of your 100 hours to to make it look
exactly the way you want it to look and um it just it like MVP should be quick
it should be dirty it should be just the core functionality but when you use
things like bootstrap or Tailwind especially with these components um
it can look good too right and so that's why we say like a beautiful MVP now if
you've been writing your custom CSS that's great I just know a lot of folks
have been like sweating like getting the
MVP done and making it look not horrible
by Tuesday this is just a quick way that you can you can get it done yeah

00:22
can you make stuff technically you could I wouldn't but technically you could
yeah cool another thing too is like somebody
give me somebody give me like the the industry that your MVP is in
like what is what is the MVP and like what industry in chat for me
Fitness all right I saw Fitness First all right
so I also like to just look at other designs so you can go to dribble but I
also just like looking at templates so uh Fitness
all right look for one that has like a lot of sales and good Stars there's a
lot of sales good Stars let's look at the live preview
so technically this is a template oh it's not look good
well if you're if you're doing like a gym site like a gym like a gym sign up

00:23
like this could be it uh this is a 20 template I'm not saying I'm not showing
this for you to buy the template I'm showing it so you can kind of look at
the design right so you can quickly see the design
like all right it's a carousel up top and then you can go find a carousel in
Daisy UI right it's uh it's kind of like a what's next and like two different
cards right so people get hung up on the design right and so it's just easy to
come and take a look at some other templates
um and see like the way that they did the design so that you're not spending
your Cycles on design right you could quickly kind of code this out
um but you're you're if you're not a designer you're not stressing about that
part right um you can look at other ones that are in
that same idea so that's kind of how I think about your MVP right you're you're
you want to get you want to get the core idea done

00:24
right you want to get the core idea done something that's going to extend the
binary boom that covers something that you're interested in and then for the
actual design of it you can look at something like theme forest find some
good ideas coded out or just throw together
um some some lovely Tailwind components and things like that so
the hard part is plugging into the ejs that's why I kind of like the tailwind
and bootstrap approach because nothing has to change with your ejs like it's
all all the classes are just in your HTML right so you're not actually
loading anything extra that's what that's what makes it good for ejs right

00:25
I'm using an HTML5 up template using the elements page for styling hell yeah
exactly that's what a good place to start yep exactly so with Tailwind the
components when you get the react it's even easier in my opinion
how late will you accept the MVP on Tuesday um I'm gonna I'm gonna give folks 24
hours from when class starts so from when class starts on Tuesday we
jump into react you got 24 hours to submit it
I really want to join 100 devs when's the next cohort we don't have any plans
for next cohort yet uh you can still join the ketchup crew right so we have
folks that join us every single day that want to learn how to code that want to
get a job uh and so you can join our ketchup crew uh folks are starting from
the beginning every single day our Discord is a wonderful community of
folks that'll help you get unstuck uh so
please uh definitely don't feel like you have to wait for the next cohort to get

00:26
started and the thing for the next cohort is we have a lot of stuff to
figure out nobody's done a live coding boot camp at scale before there's a lot
of things that we want to dial in get right make sure that we can support
folks the way that I want to support them and once we figure all that out
then we'll do another cohort mm-hmm we'll react to replace ejs it could be
for a lot of your 100 hours project it's about 50 50. for some folks they're
already too deep in their 100 hours project they don't want to add react
everybody the other half they get a lot of value out of the react they add it to
their 100 project it'll be up to you react starting Tuesday yep
and then we start October the week after yeah and we have um on I we haven't
officially announced it yet but uh we're gonna be doing like special events all
throughout October um and so we're gonna have uh RC's very

00:27
job mother the person that literally has their boots the most on the ground
helping folks get jobs uh they're gonna help us kick off onto where we're gonna
do a Discord stage um if you want somebody that's literally
talked to hundreds of employers that is literally negotiated contracts for
hundreds of people that's literally like helped hundreds of people get jobs uh
that'll be two Mondays from now so not this upcoming the following Monday yeah
I will announce all this stuff ahead of time too but just we got a lot of fun
stuff planned yeah cool alrighty other questions about the MVP I
want to make sure that we if folks have questions about it I know it's a big big
ass to get all this done so I want to make sure that if there's people that
have questions um we could do it can we do Raffles

00:28
actually we do have a raffle from the um the uh from the newsletter uh where I'm
gonna actually help somebody do all this stuff
uh any idea when YouTube will be updated uh hopefully uh by Tuesday that's my
goal is to get it up by Tuesday cool uh GitHub repos are fine for the MVP
you don't have to have it hosted yet since we actually haven't since since
Heroku is changing and we need to switch to a different provider I'm just going
to ask for your GitHub repo if you take the the extra initiative to find a new
provider that you like that's cool uh but we're I want to have a class where I
show you how to host it on the new provider that we're going forward with
before I ask is that a requirement so GitHub repo is fine
um if you host it that's even better but we'll have a class on like hosting our

00:29
projects with the new service that we choose mm-hmm
if you're having trouble with the polar crash jump on Discord jump in a voice
call folks are more than happy to help you yeah
uh what inspired we have a lot of new folks today I can see a lot of like the
first time chats uh for folks that are new uh this is 100 devs we're running a
free 30-week software engineering boot camp uh we originally started during the
pandemic I'm not a doctor I'm not a nurse I wanted to do something that
could help folks what I do know how to do is hopefully I think teach people how
to code and I have a lot of experience getting folks jobs in Tech and so
instead of having folks pay 20 30 grand for a freaking boot camp we decided to
do it free live online there's a lot of things that you have to
do to like get access to stuff but all the classes are free on YouTube like you
can you can just go to our YouTube explanation point YouTube here and chat

00:30
leonardo.com YouTube every single class is on there
um I don't even the YouTube's not even monetized so there's no ads or anything
all the materials are on Discord um so you don't need to there's like
nothing that stands in your way if you just join Discord and follow on YouTube
everything's there for free um and I'll never put any of my content
behind a paywall um I I really think this education
should be free for everyone and that's what we're doing and we've helped
hundreds of folks already get jobs and never listen to somebody on the internet
that claims that they have gotten folks hundreds of jobs go into our
celebrations Channel and see the hundreds of people that have gotten jobs
foreign devs come from I wanted to get a hundred

00:31
people jobs and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did it we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did it
this community did it uh and so um that's where 100 devs comes from
we're way past 100 now though yeah cool all right
electric codes hey thank you for the gifted Subs uh thank you for being here
um we should change it to a thousand devs I think I'm pretty partial to the
hundred devs now uh cool so that's where I went to show I wanted to give some
folks some some ease some comfort around the idea that the MVP is just an
extension of binary upload boom make it do something different make it look not
trash by using something like bootstrap or Tailwind don't be afraid to grab
components don't be afraid to look at a design as something that's similar in
your industry and just code out those pieces and let's take

00:32
the rest of the evening to work together now don't run away
whenever I say this people run away they don't put in the work tonight's your
night you're here let's put in the work uh you can either join us on Remo uh
which is for folks that are new around here it's a platform where you can sit
down at a table it puts you in a voice chat with everyone at that table it's a
it's a fantastic platform it does have its quirks um but work together tonight
just even if you want to be just headphones in screen up and you don't
talk to anyone that's fine you don't have to do it alone uh it's very
important that we get these MVPs done it's a key part of the hunt it's
something that you need if you want to get the job and so uh let's put in that
work tonight to get the MVPs done let's not do it alone let's do it together
good message today I think about where you have started
started We're not gonna say from the bottom now we're here we're pulling the

00:33
Drake lyric but we were we were fussing with HTML
we were on the Block worrying about blocks we were worrying about tags we
worrying about brownies then we were then we were tossed up in
CSS and then JavaScript whoa remember remember when remember when JavaScript
first started and Woe Is Me with John we're still a little as me with
JavaScript I've been doing this for a long time it still was me with
JavaScript a little bit remember the first time he did a code Wars what
remember the first time you saw no and I was throwing big words at you
that we didn't understand so you taught him he treated him as disrespect we were
using HTTP modules FS modules we were learning about the event Loop we were
bringing back in objects and then we added Express to the mix
then we threw in mongodb and then we threw in authentication and now we're
building full stack web applications and a huge chunk of you right now are

00:34
building your own full stack web applications right now like just take a second
take a second and Savor how far you have come right
David hey congrats on the client Savor how far we have come how you have gone
and got week after week struggle after struggle building after building and now
we're almost at the end folks this is where the rubber meets the road it's
time to get close to the hunt it's almost time to start the hunt and this
is the culmination of all your hard work so MVPs are due
don't take yourself out the game I'm giving you a whole nother week to get
these MVPs in these beautiful MVPs I should say

00:35
I'm Gonna Leave the Remo rooms open for this whole week
get on Discord ask for help get on Discord help others that are trying to
pull them across pull themselves across this Finish Line of the MVPs
all right jump into the Remo room say hey I'm going to be on Remo at this
table I'm going to leave it open all week
right this is this is this is the moment where we actually live up to being
Community taught throw on Discord hey I'm gonna be a
remote table five first floor for the next hour and if nobody shows up nobody
shows up who cares right but you tried try and bring as
many people across that finish line as you can cool and in that spirit
right and in that spirit we're extending the deadline so we can
bring as many folks as we can into hunttober so we can have that dedicated
group of folks that are ready to start the hunt they're ready to get the job

00:36
and then once we figure it out and we get it working we'll be there for the
ketchup crew when they get to that point as well got some more jobs folks we got
some more jobs I want to take a second to read through these I want to talk
very briefly about hunttober and then we're gonna pop off so you can finish
your MVPs all right uh Katie codes just signed an
offer my first uh I was getting sick towards the end of the first cohort
sicker and sicker I was in the hospital all of October half of November did
chemo recovered finally started to feel better in July and August and I signed
an offer what let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go don't ever take yourself out the game
don't ever take yourself out the game I love it it's low pressure a non-profit

00:37
they believe in four blocks from their house while they recover it's perfect a
congrats that's huge don't take yourself out the game y'all come on now
uh I think I shared this a little bit before but it's official
I finally got the job I'm so excited and grateful for this community hashtag
Community taught uh and everything I've learned from it I want to share a bit
about my journey here thank you for sharing the details um
first off when Leon mentions people getting jobs by coding a button I didn't
want to believe it there's another button store I'm out
first off when Leon mentioned people who got jobs by cutting button I don't

00:38
believe it but it's true [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bruh
100 buttons next boot camp next cohort just buttons
uh but it's true I landed a six-figure fully remote front-end developer position
um for a role at a specific Company by coding basic HTML CSS and JavaScript
that's it so just know that those jobs are
definitely out there uh wasn't an easy Road
uh can't stress enough having an online presence and building in public helps as
you all are building your MVPs share right share your MVP on Twitter share

00:39
share the things that you're building uh through the community use the 100 devs
tag right let other folks see it uh get your LinkedIn filled out build in
public show everyone what you're doing even if nobody is engaging with your
post if somebody shares their MVP on Twitter and they use the hundred devs
hashtag just give them a follow I mean let me not follow like give them like a
like right just give them a like help boost it right help other folks see it
that aren't in their Network that aren't in your network
uh that's how I managed to get four interviews without ever applying to a
single job four interviews without ever applying to
a single job they all found me through Linkedin I went from still grinding this
past Tuesday to getting the offer during class on Thursday while he was shouting
out the celebrations Channel shout out to celebrations Channel a different

00:40
ghost hey what's up uh so shout out to celebrations Channel I I have 12 on the
slides there is way more in the celebrations Channel like I literally
I literally couldn't put them all in here and there's like ones I did like I
think they're just better read in the celebrations Channel blah hey thank you
for the gift of Subs hope you're doing well in the house

make sure your LinkedIn is crispy is a requirement for hunttober make sure your
linkedin's crispy folks you're saying it wow hope you're doing well all right

00:41
I used to scroll through this Channel and dream of the day it'd be my turn to
post today is that day back if I began networking with the lead
Dev at my company this is huge if you already have a job one of the best
things you can do is just network with the other engineers at your company
right so many folks get that first shot in Tech that first shot uh at something
that's that might not be engineering or even tangential just because they're
they're talking to other folks at their company um
I'll be okay in the future one month ago began the helper QA role part time last
weekend internal QA another position was posted I applied and I got work today
the role is mine let's go congrats uh would not gotten this far without the
hundred devs Community all the basic Engineers become friend with Community
taught networking Works uh I got like someone decided to give me a chance to

00:42
break into Tech onwards next stop software engineer let's no
let's go let's go I love this example because you'd be surprised just
networking with the individuals at the job you're already at a part-time job
you're already at can lead to some amazing things
uh Curtis hey looks like we're popping off this week it's finally my turn to
join the celebrations Channel I love the shout out table eight from the very
first Remo session uh their twitch streams uh the 30 plus study group for
all the support along the way shout out to study groups
uh we have to write the accountability structure and motivation the rest of
communities helped me get past Roblox I love that right Community Helping get
past roadblocks and provide a lot of encouragement along the way they signed
an offer letter for AWS oh man come on now

00:43
come on now how many folks do we have at Amazon now this is ridiculous
we just got like a small club at Amazon now it's what like at least four or five
this cohort like what get out of here you always need to link
up I hope you all are linking up I'll I'll try and facilitate that somehow
be on the team that does video transcoding
um make sure you're all doing your Anki cards networking and go getting now I
will also say um that Curtis specifically in the
celebrations channel has a huge thread that gives way more detail and they ask
that we not post it so of course it's not here but if you go into the
celebrations Channel a lot of the folks that I am sharing right now have shared
more uh in the threads and so if you're not looking through those threads you're
missing out on a lot of value that's being posted there that's going to help
you in your job hunt and so make sure you're going through the celebrations

00:44
Channel make sure you're looking at these threads because folks are really
taking the heart hey when you get the job please please yes make the
celebrations post but then tell us the details tell us what it was like
interviewing tell us what it was like to to to to go through that experience
because that is the most valuable thing we have right now is like real boots on
the ground understanding of what the market is like what people are looking
for and you can't get that anywhere else
and so when you when you post share more so that we can learn and incorporate
that into our hunt cool I love that folks are still getting
their paid clients I finally got silver I got a paid freelancing client over
over okay over a thousand what that's wild to me
that that what was I don't remember the final number it was over half a million

00:45
it was over half a million in client work can we just stop and think about
that for a second it's probably way higher now that other folks are getting
their clients done but our community brought in over a half a million dollars
in client work half a million that's the start of equity right like
that's the start right like we built something really special
but the idea that it's free is not enough the idea that folks have also
made half a million dollars while going through program that that's when it
starts to be real that's when it starts to be what what I'm envisioning right
like it's one thing for be free but it's one thing to also make some cheddar
along the way and so congrats on getting the paid client that's huge
I love they shot out the palm the Pomodoro crew vcg fam a
all right I like this too because this this is just showing you what what can

00:46
happen uh I have a weird one I got a major promotion because of 100 devs I
love it uh I caught the attention the powers
that be a long story short I'm now the lead instructional developer and working
on complete redesigning our training process uh they like that I uh because
they're so excited about the way I relearned how to learn and I was using
the things I learned in 100 devs to help
teach our new hires in a way that helped them better retain I was making some
simple tools to help current teams so they took the learning how to learn
knowledge and they used it on the job this is police this is what we're going
to talk about post hunt but one of the best things you can do
the easiest dub you can ever have when you join your company right the first
three months on the job matter the most when you join a new company and one of
the easiest dubs you can have is to document the entire process of joining
that company no one at the company can have that experience of what it's like

00:47
to be an engineer day one at that company and if you can build better
tools better documentation here's where I got this resource here's how I how I
uh connected to this database here's how I did this and you have the road map of
what it's like to be day one on the job of that company right
every person that comes after you will think you're the goat
right every single person that comes after you is going to read that
documentation they're going to see that you're the person that helped them when
they were stuck right and they're gonna see you as that
person day one and so please make sure that you're bringing this learning how
to learn this ability to help others into your job like the whole nature of
us being Community taught like a nice thing but it's a real thing that's going

00:48
