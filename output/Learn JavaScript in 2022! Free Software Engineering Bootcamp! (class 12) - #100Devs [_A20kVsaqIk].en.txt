[Music] javascript let's go good morning good afternoon good evening america
tonight bangers only folks bangers only folks we got some javascript to get into
hey what's going on everybody get on in here get on in here hope you all are

00:01
doing well hope you're fired up hope you're ready to get into
our first programming language we've done markup languages now it's time for
our programming language hey see a lot of readies i see a lot of
reddies you know how we do i always like to start off with the
question of the day the question of the day today is would you rather
would you rather one free domino's pizza that is the best thing you
have ever and will ever taste or would you rather a free domino's pizza
every month for the rest of your life so i want to see
one or month one means you want the one best thing you'll ever taste and will
ever taste and month means a free pizza every month

00:02
let's see one or more wonder month exactly vlog we go get
all right i'm seeing i've seen a good mix here i've seen a good mix got some
mumps we got some ones you know what i i'm still feeling i'm feeling the one on
this one i want i i want to but then you peak right like
if you have the one best thing you'll ever taste like and you're you're
younger like it's just it's just over right i don't know
but a free pizza each month would be pretty dope i'm gonna go
you know what i'm gonna switch out i'm gonna go one free pizza a month i think
that that'll keep me you know make it something special it comes every
month i'm gonna go with that i don't want to peak this early i want to peak
this early all right i don't want to have the best thing ever
it tastes great i'm going to go with one free pizza a month hey

00:03
leon's trying to get around this domino's band
it comes free i haven't paid for it all right shout out domino's pizza
hope y'all are doing well all right let's talk about tonight
got a lot to get into a lot to get into folks uh we're gonna talk
a little bit about what it's like to learn javascript the trials the
tribulations the trough of sorrow what it really takes to understand javascript
then we're going to dive into like what actually is programming
right we're gonna take a little bit of time to talk through what is programming
what is it at its essence we're gonna build a youtube background picker
all those youtubers have really dope backgrounds they got lights going we're
going to build an app that can help them choose their next background
we're going to learn about variables and types so if you did the uh the homework
you might be uh you might already be there might already

00:04
know about these these these variables and types things but if it's still not
clear we're going to go in that tonight we're going to build a not so great
calculator it's going to be a very very simple calculator we're going to build
that together we're going to look at how to do
arithmetic math in javascript we're going to work through conditional logic
we're going to build an agri-parent simulator if we get if we have the time
and then we're going to build a temperature converter together so a lot
to get through tonight we might have to save the anchor pattern or the
temperature converter to next class we're going to try and do the thing tonight
all right as always you know how i like to start off
i like to start off with my questions so if you got questions
maybe i got answers how y'all doing who's going to carry the boots and logs
we're going to carry the votes in the lies so i'm going to say

00:05
good i am good yeah thank you for asking can we turn in the layouts if we had if
we're a tad behind that's a great question so
i think folks are all going to be in different places right remember when i
asked you to do the layouts i said to get the layouts done as close
as you can with the time you had allotted some folks are going to have
more time some folks are going to have less time so i want you to submit all
your layouts tonight as far as you got them right
remember i wasn't looking for pixel perfection i said if you had a client
do you rather go to your client and say i got all seven of the projects some of
the way there or i only got one of them the way there right so turn in what you
got as far as you got and feel good with the work that you've
been able to do and i think this is a really important question to start off
with because for for most of us we had never touched code before

00:06
right we had never touched code before and in 10 nights
you gave me 10 nights think about where you are in just 10 nights of code
right you gave me 10 nights where you just came to class you put in some work
right think about where you are right now and
so a lot of people when this assignment is due
right when this assignment's due they don't feel great about where they got
with their layouts maybe they didn't get as far as they want it maybe they're
missing one or two but it's been 10 classes let that sink in for a second
10 nights think about how far you have come in just 10 nights and you should be
proud you should be i don't care how far you
got i don't care how good your layouts look you should be damn proud of
yourself because you know why there are thousands of other people that said they
wanted to learn how to code this year

00:07
and where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they at i don't see them
i'm looking i don't see them but you're here you showed up
you put in some of the work you deserve to be proud of where you're
at and what you got done i don't care how far along you got and
how care of the perfect they are you are miles ahead of all the people that said
you know what i want to make a difference in my life this year i want
to make a positive change in my life i'm
going to learn how to code and they they sat on their butts
they didn't put in any work they didn't they didn't show up to class
they didn't turn in any homework they didn't get any layouts done so you can't
hang your head low when you're miles ahead of the thousands
and thousands of other people that said
they wanted to learn this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then did nothing right

00:08
so i i i know this is a little weird i want you to congratulate yourself
i want you to say your name right and then say that you're proud of
yourself for the work that you did for the times that you showed up i want you
to say it out loud i don't care if you're i know some of you are like are
at starbucks some of you in the back of panera bread i don't care i want you to
say your name and that you're proud of yourself leon i'm proud of you you put
in a lot of work over these past couple weeks
i want you to say it if you're here i want you to say i want you literally say
it out loud because you deserve it daddy yankee in the house what's up
i'm proud of you i'm proud of you too daddy yankee
cool that's how i want to start tonight i want to start tonight you should be
damn proud that you're here that you showed up because there are thousands of
people that said the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they ain't here no more
they ain't here no more it's just us you should be proud all right tonight

00:09
there's a lot right tonight there's a lot and
what i want to kind of put out there is that you should be proud of yourself and
tonight i want you to be sponges i want you to be sponges
tonight is not the night to understand tonight is not the night for things to
click and make sense tonight is not the night for you to understand
javascript tonight is about me showing you some dope stuff right
i'm a dope person i do dope things right so tonight is about me showing you some
cool stuff i want you to sit back and go
ah that's pretty cool i kind of get this javascript thing and what it might be
able to do i don't care if you learn syntax tonight i don't care if you
learn any javascript tonight i want you to look at the stuff that we're able to
do tonight and go huh that's pretty cool i'm excited
to spend the next couple weeks learning that stuff you're not going to walk away
tonight a javascript master right it's just not going to happen

00:10
and so i want you to to be a sponge to absorb to take it all in to ask some
good questions and then we're going to have the next couple of weeks for all
this stuff to click i'm going to show you a lot of stuff tonight this will not
be the only time we see this stuff we're going to recover things over and over
again dab let's go hey how you doing right we're going to do this stuff over and
over again so tonight you're a sponge you're absorbing you're turning on your
beyonce we're going to go down the roller coaster together but we're going
to have fun cool if you haven't checked in yet please go
ahead and check in you can always do exclamation point check-in here in chat
or the tweet's always in the follow-on materials channel in the going live
channel or if you just follow me on twitter you'll see it go live an hour
before class for folks that are new my name is leon we are running a 30 week

00:11
software engineering bootcamp the goal is to go from zero to employed for
absolutely free all of our content is always put out
there for free never behind any paywalls you can come learn how to code with the
best community to learn how to code live online
hands down we're 25 000 strong in our discord
exclamation point discord here in chat or leonwell.com discord com get your
questions answered find folks that are going to go through the struggle we call
it the trough of sorrow together alrighty folks thank you for checking in
submitting work those layouts that we talked about right
get it get get all the layouts in you can use codepen you can use glitch you
can use any of the things that you feel comfortable with i want you to submit

00:12
your layouts where they are at where they are at okay where they're at
and like i said hang your head high i don't give a crap how far you got i
don't give a crap how good your layouts look every single person here including
myself can do better we can all do better i don't care how
crispy you think your layouts look you can do better
i'll get you one dab i'll get you one you can do better so tonight when you're
submitting these stuff you keep your head high
you're miles ahead of folks that said they want to do this crap and ain't
doing it so submit what you got as far as you got
and be proud of what the work that you put in
then as you have time as you have the privilege of time make them better you
can always come back to your work and make it better whenever i have free time

00:13
and i want to put it and investing it into learning i go back and i redo stuff
i add the stuff i tweak stuff you can do the same
maybe you learn more flexbox over the next couple of weeks and you come back
and you make them better this submission will stay open resubmit it
i don't care if it's a week from now a month from now when you feel better
about it when you feel like you've done more when you've done better come back
and resubmit alrighty exactly we go get all right
occ hey thank you for the thousand bits that's wild i appreciate that thank you
so much um and thank you everyone for all the subs and the the
the primers where jeff bezos is sweating right now
seeing their net worth just go down from all the prime subs that come in if you

00:14
have amazon prime it's completely free to sub
a lot of folks did that last time and i really really appreciate it all the subs
go to nonprofit i work at during the day so i appreciate y'all all right i
about a year a year or so ago uh was talking to
uh one of our experts in residence at brazilian coders cindersvt hey thank you
for the get the subs i appreciate you thank you so much thank you for being
here uh their name is vons and they're an expert in residence they
were a student that went through rc then they joined wayfair as an engineer
then they joined salesforce as an engineer and then they came back
uh and joined resilient coders as a person in the classroom with us uh we we
don't we so a lot of a lot of boot camps
they do some shady [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where like their
graduates get immediately hired back we don't we don't do that you got to go
into the workforce and then come back i see some folks know vaughn's they are

00:15
really the best they are all right so i was talking to them about a year ago
and they were relating super lotta let me try that a little bit
uh they were relating their learning to code journey to their
martial arts background right and they practiced martial arts for a very
very long time and the thing that they always said was
that the the way they pushed themselves was always about half hard work
and then half believing they could do the things that they wanted to do
and they actually related it to a baby learning how to walk so this is not my
knowledge this is vans but i love it it's the perfect ethos it's the perfect
mindset to go into learning javascript because it really highlights a really
important point when a baby is learning how to walk they fall they get up

00:16
they fall again they get up they fall again they get up
they keep falling they keep getting back up and eventually
they learn how to walk and the beautiful thing
sometimes they poop themselves exactly sometimes they poop themselves
but the beautiful thing is you don't ever see a baby in the corner doing this
i'm never going to learn how to walk this is this this will never happen i
see all these adults walking around i'll never be able to do that
i didn't eat my carrots today and since i didn't eat my carrots i'm not gonna be
able to walk later i i i i fell earlier and and i and i hit
my knee and now i'll never be able to walk right you don't have nobody puts
baby in the corner right they're not in the corner
having an existential crisis about learning how to walk

00:17
they see everyone doing around them and they know that with time they will learn
how to walk too that's the mindset you need to have going into javascript
javascript is going to be half hard work like really hard work
and half just believing you can do it and believing you can do it is actually
the harder part so many folks will get one two three
classes into javascript and that's it that they're packing it up they're going
home because after three classes they don't feel like it's clicking for three
classes they don't feel like that they're ever gonna be able to learn
javascript in the future ever with time you will it's half hard work
it's half believing you can do it and that believing you can do it is the hard
part if you were learning japanese right if

00:18
you didn't already speak japanese and you were trying to learn japanese for
the first time and you were three classes in you
wouldn't be stressing out over the fact that you were not fluent in that brand
new language all right you wouldn't be sitting in a
corner crying yourself to sleep feeling ashamed feeling bad feeling down
about yourself because after three classes you weren't fluent in japanese
you weren't flying to you weren't flying to japan to like live it up
right you know that it's going to take you a long time you know it's going to
take a lot of hard work right you know that eventually you could get there but
it's going to be half hard work going to be half believing you can do it
i have seen students from every walk of life
you name it i've worked with a student from that background
and i've seen all these different types of people be successful
i do not care your background i do not care how good you are at math i do not

00:19
care if you went to school i do not care if you have a degree you can learn
javascript its half hard work and its half believing you can do it and
that believing you can do it is the hard
part but i'm going to tell you right now you can do it you can
absolutely and we're going to do it together
when you get stuck when you fall down go on discord so we can pick you back up
when you trip and you poop yourself just like the baby on the screen come to
discord so we can pick you back up you're gonna fall over and over and over
again but you're going to keep getting back up
and what i need for you to believe in this moment is that it is possible
for you to learn this language it is possible for you to build
amazing things you have all the raw materials you need and just like the

00:20
video i had you watch right just like i had the video that i
had you watch before class when that bell rings it's time to go to work
don't show up in the ring if you don't think you can win because you can
time to put in work it's time to push it's time to fall it's time to get back
up and we'll get there together right cool so we're talking about the
golden rule now but for the first time we hit the last piece here right we
always said that our content goes in our html
our style goes in our css but finally we get to the behavior and interaction
piece right we're able to put our behavior interaction in our javascript
right and we keep all these things separate why

00:21
organization exactly it's all about organization
right and tonight we're going to finally see
we're going to finally see this behavior and interaction come to life
so far we've covered html and css html and css what we call markup languages
they're not true programming languages right some people will nerd out on that
but tonight javascript is a fully featured programming language we'll be
able to do amazing things with it and be able to build and finally add that
behavior interaction cool the other beautiful thing about
javascript is that it is a beautiful language that is a higher level language
it's something that we can understand as humans and share our code with each
other and understand what's happening in our programs we're gonna be able to
digest that tonight and build some cool stuff all right
in our html and css classes we saw ids and classes they're important to bring

00:22
up again right now because we're gonna use ids to target specific elements
in our html that we want to attach or listen to for behaviors right so
we're going to see in our javascript that we're going to target these ids to
target one specific thing in our code so we can do cool stuff with it same thing
with classes we might be using classes a little bit more now to target multiple
elements to add those behaviors to add those
interactions to our applications so if you haven't really used your ids or
classes that much get ready we're about to see a lot of them cool
let's talk about programming let's get our fingers on the keyboard let's hit
some of that clackity clack uh we're all here
to learn our first true programming language that is javascript but before
we get there we got to actually understand what the heck programming actually is

00:23
so the key rule here the thing that you need to keep in mind above all
is that a computer will do what you tell it to do it's beautiful
we can tell computers to do amazing things and they'll do them with
precision and speed that humans cannot comprehend or do on their own
but at a fundamental level a computer will do what you tell it to do so
a program is simply a set of instructions that you
write to tell a computer what to do if you ever said like what's a program
a program is just a set of instructions keep that idea of a set of instructions
in your brain so if computers just do what we tell them to do
well a program is just those instructions that we write to tell a
computer what to do okay and if a program is a set of
instructions well then programming is the task of writing those

00:24
instructions in a language that the computer can understand okay
now the wonderful thing is we are going to learn javascript tonight
javascript is a beautiful language that humans can understand
right that i can share my javascript code with you you can look at it and
quickly realize maybe what's happening in the program
and we're able to share it with other engineers that can quickly look at it
and understand what's going on but that javascript is actually not
something that a computer truly understands it's too high level
that javascript has to be broken down all the way into something that the
computer can actually understand so tonight we're going to be focusing a lot
on the higher level javascript that we can exchange with each other to
understand what's going on in our sets of instructions we're writing for the
computer but we're also going to spend a

00:25
few moments tonight to talk about what's happening deep down that level at the
lower level at the deeper we call it closer to the metal right the stuff that
the computer can actually really understand cool so i need you to give me some
artistic license here some uh some educational freedom as we might say
uh give me the chance to present an example that's not
100 true or correct but it's something that we can hopefully latch on to to
better understand this idea of low level versus high level and i appreciate all
the nun spam in chat oh that's beautiful it's just nuns all the way down
thank you everyone uh so if you're subbed you get the
emotes if you got a gift that sub which a lot of people are community love to do
you have the emotes if you use your prime for free you have the emotes but

00:26
if you have channel uh channel points you can unlock the
emotes with your channel points as well love all the nuns fan that's hilarious
all right so give me some freedom here now here is a very simple
circuit and i'm going to draw we're going to have a wire coming out this side
we're going to connect it to a battery and then a wire that comes up this way
this is a closed circuit with a battery and a light bulb and so this light bulb
would be turned on right so right now the circuit is closed and the light is on
[Music] a thank you so much for being jakkub thank you so much for the
uh five get themselves i appreciate you it's so loud
i think the um the alert sounds are back to what they were before hold on one

00:27
second let's uh let's make sure that it's not not too wild one second
i can fix it all right there we go i i cut it in half
so hopefully it's not too wild all right that should work
there we go i left you in the dark to fix it we're good alrighty
so here we have a circuit right we have a circuit and

00:28
we have a circuit and right now it's a completely closed circuit so the light
is on right the light is on let's go ahead and
slightly modify the circuit so that there is a switch and so
we'll have a completely closed circuit on the right with a battery
and then over here we have a switch so right now if slip a brick
hey thank you for the 10 gift itself that's so wild thank you for being here vip
slip on a stick brick all right that's wild
thank you for being here thank you for the gift of subs it's still loud
it's better but still loud all right we'll fix it during the break
to go a bit more all right i got you thank you for the gift it subs all right

00:29
right now we have a circuit with a switch on it
and right now the switch is open so the light is not on right
if i was to close the circuit our light would turn on right
the light would turn on so we now have a circuit that we could represent
one where the light is on and one where the light is off
if i want it to repre represent this circuit and the most basic form i see a
lot of folks kind of slowly getting here where we're going is we could represent
it with like a singular character maybe if the circuit was
off or open we could represent it with a zero
and if the circuit was closed maybe we could represent it with a one
right and then we can start to represent our circuits as either open

00:30
or closed or in this case on or off right on or off
and this beautiful base level kind of understanding is the fundamental aspect
that we can use to build up to our modern computers and let me show you how
so we have a very simple circuit here but let's add another switch
let's go ahead and have a switch on both sides there we go
if i wanted to represent this switch with the logic that we just presented right
what number would i use to represent this circuit
what could i write throw it in chat for me please yeah we can represent this as

00:31
zero zero right that both the switches are open
now something really cool let's say i closed this circuit here
how can i represent this circuit chat yeah let's let's say one zero right
now our circuit is 1 0 we're saying that the first switch is closed or and then
the second one is still open and then how can i represent this circuit right
here how could i represent this new circuit
yeah i could represent it with one one dope so now i have a circuit that i'm
representing with one one and something very special just happened by saying 1-1
we just built up the most simplest bit of logic when i say 1-1

00:32
what logic am i actually representing very very simple bit of logic when i say
one one i'm saying what i'm saying this blank this
yeah i'm saying and i'm saying this switch and this switch are both closed
so at its very basic form just from this idea of on and off
and just with a very simple circuit i could then demonstrate this idea of
and and i have the very simplest bit of logic already
we start to build these up and we call them logic gates
and at a very fundamental level we can build up from these zeros and ones these
on and off to very simple logic to slightly larger bits of logic right we
throw in things like a arithmetic logic unit which helps us do calculations we

00:33
throw in a program counter and we throw in a little bit of memory and we have a
computer right so from this very base logic we can build up to a language that
the computer can at least understand at this very raw level the zeros and ones
this very basic logic but we as humans do not want to be talking in zeros and
ones we do not want to be talking in these like very primitive bits of logic we
want to be able to talk in a language that makes sense so while the computer
may understand this we build up on top of that logic and we
go higher and higher until we're writing
out something that's human readable that we can understand as humans and not be
talking nonsense in zeros and ones and so that's where javascript comes from
javascript is a language that humans can understand that looks like it's written
in normal english but eventually can be broken all the way down into this very

00:34
simple logic these zeros and ones that the computer can realistically understand
okay now the cool thing is um you can really nerd
out over this stuff there is this wonderful book by chris pretzel called
code the hidden language of computing i think it's called uh and chris pretzel
walks through this in amazing detail and they start all the way back with how
ships used to communicate they want to know
how like way back in the day different ships across the horizon would
communicate with each other way before morris code yeah they would
use flags they would wave different flags and they could build out a whole
communication system off of waving different flags
and then those flags eventually when it became nighttime they would switch to
lights and they would start flashing different bits of light
at night so folks in the distance could see

00:35
and those lights turned into morris code and then from morris code we got higher
and higher levels all the way up to modern computing so if this stuff is
really cool to you if you feel like you want to nerd out on this i really
recommend chris pretzel's book code the hidden language
i'll put it on discord after after class but this idea of base low
level computing is how computers really work and we're just lucky that we're not
here 30 40 50 years ago we don't have to write this anymore we we can write
high-level languages javascript that make way more sense and know underneath
the hood they're being broken down into stuff like this cool now
i gave you some homework the homework was to watch independence day okay
if you didn't watch independence day it's a wrap this whole rest of this

00:36
class the whole rest of the cohort will all be independence day themed
it's just it's just over i'm joking we're going to use independence day to
highlight a very specific story that i think is important for us to understand
before we move into actual javascript all right so
if you watched independence day right these these alien ships come to earth
right these alien ships come to earth and when the alien ships come to earth
something weird happens we had actually had a crashed alien ship that was the
roswell crash we had a crashed alien ship it was in area 51 and when the
alien ships came to earth what happened to the ship that we had in area 51.

00:37
yeah you lack you got that yep it turned on
right when the other ships came close the ship we had in area 51 like turned
on the power came on its shields came on it activated and so this is
a really interesting bit of information that means somehow there's like
proximity and maybe like their communication and their power systems
are like intertwined like they're able to like communicate to other ships
they're able to like send power to those other ships and so we know that they're
connected in some way right that when the other ships came close this ship
that we had got power it turned on it had its shields right and so that leads
like something pretty interesting that could happen that
that the the communication the power systems are all kind of connected all
right cool now uh there was a ship in the usa

00:38
that we immediately tried to like nuke out of orbit and we we hit it with our
nukes right and nothing happened why did nothing happen
when we hit it with our nukes the alien ship that was over the u.s or one of
them that was over the u.s yeah it had shields and so the shields
we hit it with the nuke and it just like poof popped off like nothing happened
the shields were too great and so we knew
right we knew that if we wanted to like save the world we're going to bring down
those force fields those shields so what did jeff goldblum do to save the world
what did jeff goldblum do to save the world yeah they wrote a computer virus
that they then injected into the alien mothership and the cool thing is once we
put the virus into the alien mothership since we know like that communication

00:39
power system is intertwined as soon as we injected the virus into
the alien mothership all the other alien ships their their their
shields went down and we were able to hit them with a nuke save the world
america right and so how how was jeff goldblum able to write a program
that ran on an alien mothership so we could bring down their shields hit them
with the nuke save the world america how is that possible
something a lot of people say like javascript no we're not there yet i i
don't think the alien ships were using javascript maybe maybe
out there in galaxy far far away uh they're still writing javascript um
no they we did something else we we have to assume

00:40
right we have to assume even though these are advanced alien civilizations
we have to uh assume that there are some universal constants in this world or in
this universe i should say right we should assume that like math is
a universal constant we should assume like physics is a universal constant and
maybe this idea of on and off are also universal constants so if on and off is
a universal constant right and even though they are an alien
civilization from far far away their computing systems still have to boil down
to zeros and ones to binary to on and off it's universal right
and so jeff goldblum what they did is they did something called reverse
engineering they took their code and they reduced it all the way down to the
zeros and ones and they built it all the way back up to

00:41
a virus that they could inject into the alien mothership and i know this sounds
like really far-fetched and it's it it is because of the amount of time that
they had to do it but the act of doing it is not too out there reverse
engineering is a skill set there are some people in this world that are very
very good at it they can do it very very quickly uh one of my favorite youtubers
their name is scanlime and what they do is they people like send them stuff and
they reverse engineer anything you send them and like get it to do weird stuff
right the very first time i heard about reverse well not the first time but the
first time i was really excited about it uh there's this talk that i'll put on
discord afterwards uh of this woman that reverse engineers tamagotchis
tamagotchis are like little virtual pets and they reverse engineer all the way
back to like the machine level code a little bit above those zeros and ones
and then they were able to build back up to make the tamagotchis do really cool
stuff right and it like blew i remember watching it talk my mind just being

00:42
blown i was like you could do that people are people are saying that's my
middle school years yeah mine too i still got my tamagotchis
oh look at that boom it's not a tamagotchi that is a pokemon pikachu two and uh
has a little pedometer in it yeah i know you're jealous it's okay
and back in the day i was all about my my virtual pets i'd be walking around
school bam having the you know you just had it on your backpack you had to make
sure everybody saw boom look at it right there i had the
the baby nano that was the hot one for a
minute i had the uh the digimon that was a hot one for a second i had the uh
the salem gigapet bam in the face right there walking down
the hall yeah i was i was cool it's all right anyway back to our story

00:43
the idea of having this alien civilization
breaking it all the way back down to the zeros and ones and all the way back up
that's a true story that could really happen right we could do that
and so around this way we like to mark this momentous occasion right
we need to mark this momentum the momentous occasion we have a saying
around here for for this legendary event in human history
uh if you've been around these parts before do you know what we call this
epic moment in human history the 4th of july it's not 4th of july
yeah we call this binary upload boom right we wrote binary we upload it it went
boom right because we nuked them america and what i want you to remember here is
that as you're writing javascript you are sitting on the shoulders of

00:44
giants folks that have come before us to write the ones and zeroes the zeros and
ones to write the machine code to write the assembly that sits on top of that to
write the code that interfaces with the assembly and c to then use that c to
build up to the languages that we use today like javascript right and so when
you're writing javascript and you can understand it like a human know that it
is breaking down all the way to these zeros and ones and we don't have
switches anymore we don't have like physical like closing switches we have
transistors and those transistors are turning on and off and so as you're
writing javascript you have this immense amount of power
right the power to to bring down shields the power to to destroy alien
civilizations and we just have a few things for you to
learn to wield that power correctly and so tonight we learn javascript

00:45
let's get some alrighty so javascript is a language
that we are going to use to tell the computer what to do i
don't need you to get it tonight thank you i don't need you to get it tonight i
need you to sit back relax enjoy soak up what we're about to cover like a sponge
see the cool stuff that we can eventually start to do right and
take that excitement into our next few classes where we go deep and all these
topics start to make sense but tonight's

00:46
not the night tonight for me to show you some cool stuff to do some dope things
together and to to to hopefully be inspired for what's to come all right
when we wrote html in css we had a specific syntax
right we had a specific syntax we had these rules that we had to follow when
writing our html and css we had carrots we had
curly braces all these things that we had to follow for
it to work well javascript has its own specific syntax as well
all right and so over the next couple classes we're going to introduce more
and more right of this syntax right we're going to introduce more and
more of this syntax and as we go through it
as we go through it we're going to pick up a lot of more characters and i bring

00:47
this up right now because as you start to write more
javascript your fingers are going to stretch they're going to expand
right they're going to they're gonna expand
you're gonna be move using keys that you haven't really ever used before and so
this is another gentle reminder to take care of yourself
uh because a lot of people really do burn out their hands
when they first start getting into their
first real programming languages because i'm going to show you right now
all of the characters that actually show up when you're writing
javascript okay there's a lot of special
characters that we're going to use and i want to make sure that everyone
understands the different characters what they are how we're going to use
them and so let's go ahead and just take a quick
second to walk through all the different characters and see them so
open up my inspector here i'm going to open up my console just so

00:48
i can type here and show you some stuff all right i'm going to look at my
keyboard here and i'm going to walk through the different things that i see
so starting off we have our lovely square brackets
we're going to use these square brackets a lot especially when it comes to using
things like arrays so these square brackets are really important to kind of
recognize okay next we have some people call these
curly braces they're technically called figure brackets
but i call them curly braces because that's the dope thing to do and i'm a
dope person so i'm going to call them curly braces next we have
our less than and greater sign with with our [Music] with our
javascript where they're not really like brackets
right they're they're they're not they're not the things that we're using

00:49
to like encapsulate what you did with html we're using these for logic
less than or greater than right so we're
going to start seeing these be used when we get to comparison when we get to our
conditional logic later today right we'll be using them for less than or
greater than things like that we're still going to have our commas and
ticks they have places and sorry and dots we have our they have their place
in javascript we have a forward slash which we'll see
uh when we get to things like division our forward slash will be used for
division and we also have our question mark uh this question mark
in javascript actually gets a name it's called a ternary selector don't worry
about that for right now i'm just showing that it'll come up
and some people might call it a ternary but we'll get there
we're gonna have our colons and our semicolons and we're gonna use these
quite often colon and then semicolon we're gonna have our singular quotes and
our double quotes and we're also gonna have ticks which are with the tilde key

00:50
right that'll all kind of serve similar purposes
we're going to have backslashes that you'll see come up and then really
important on that key right above your enter key is the pipe character
and this double whenever you have these two pipe characters next to each other
that is how we represent the logic of or right now we say or so whenever you see
the double pipe character that's or we're going to have hyphens and they're
going to be used for subtraction right and then we're going to have our
parentheses now for some reason i don't know when i
picked up this habit i call parentheses parens i don't know where it comes from
so if you ever hear me talking about parens i i just mean parentheses i've
tried to wipe it from my vocabulary it just doesn't want to get out of there so
you ever hear me say parens i mean parentheses
we're going to have our asterisk for multiplication

00:51
and then double ampersand is another bit of logic for and right double pipe
characters or double ampersand is and so like this and that
we have a percent sign but we don't call the percent sign in most programming
languages we call it modulus and this percent sign or modulus
is how we get remainders right it's how we get the remainder so
like when you divide a number by another number whatever's left over that's the
remainder that's what modulus is for and don't worry we're going to see all
these come up again i just wanted to show you them before we get started
we're going to see the dollar sign come up but most people refer to this as
bling so whenever i say the word bling i actually mean the dollar sign that you
see there uh octothorpes are still going to come
up they're not hashtags they're not pound signs they're octothorpes and then
one that comes up a lot because it actually means not in javascript is the bang
uh it's not an exclamation point it is bang

00:52
so if you ever heard me say like bang discord bang slides what i'm actually
saying is exclamation point discord exclamation point slides right and so
instead of calling an exhibition point we call it a bang cool
we got our plus sign for addition we got our equal sign uh for assignment
and comparison when we get a little bit further
and then we also have a till day which will come into effect as well so if you
notice all these characters are on the edge of your fans right they're things
you'll be reaching for so please watch the dr levi video get your hands
moving stretching take your breaks when we take a break together actually take
your break right make sure that you're giving a
good stretch you're shaking out your hands that you can
be in this for the long haul for the long run all right now speaking of breaks

00:53
before we jump into our youtube background picker and see javascript
alive for the first time let's take our break we'll take a little bit early
today and take our five minutes if you're new around here we like to be
healthy we like to make sure that we're in this for the long haul
we take five minute breaks at the top of the hour if you're able please get up
move around stretch if you're watching this on youtube before you take your
break on youtube go ahead and give us a thumbs up if you aren't subscribed go
ahead and subscribe all right and let's go ahead and take our five minute break
alrighty five minutes on the clock bring the tunes up and i'll give you all

00:57
what you really want is bob five yo yeah dmv it's all javascript today we're in

00:58
a minute left folks share this stretching video it's dr levi
the fitness doctor it's on uh discord let's try it again
what kind of domino's pizza should i order tonight oh the hard question
playing with spinach way to go what's hydration today it's just uh some nice tea
vanilla chai that i normally go with oh with some with some jalapenos too
that's the move why domino's because they're the best pizza
all right folks come on back come on back should we code along not tonight civic

00:59
not tonight civic place tonight to enjoy to ask good questions not to code along
all right come on back folks chill the music here alrighty
so uh today we're going to look at some code and like i said before the break
you're a sponge you're not trying to get the the perfect
meaning you're not trying to even really understand what's going on
it's just to look and go oh that's pretty cool and then in a few more
classes you'll be able to do it all together all right
so i'm going to go ahead and open up our starter code for this evening
if you're new and you want the starter code we always share that on our discord
before class so you can do exclamation point discord it's just leon noel.com

01:00
discord you agree to the rules and then there's this follow-along materials
channel that'll always have everything that you that you need
yeah i didn't change the sound alerts i'm gonna keep them loud all right
rolling loud gonna be a murder in miami if they play it rolling loud
oh no did i move my folder one second i i like slip clicked and i don't know
where i moved the folder oh there you go all right it's on my desktop

01:01
there we go all right cool all right so here in my 12 class 12 folder right
in my class 12 folder we have this background picker and i'm going to open
up the html and i'm also going to open up the
javascript for the first time folks we got javascript files hey
sledge is up to you everybody's different join the catch-up crew on
discord though all right first class we got some javascript now remember
your sponge let's get lost together let's have a
good time let's let's get lost in the code and see where we wind up right
all right i'm gonna go ahead and open this html in the browser
and here we go we got a lovely youtube background picker okay
if you're a youtuber you need a dope background
right you need to be able to like have your lights going to stand out these

01:02
days and so what we have here is the ability right
the ability to click on things and for the very first time have
behavior and interaction so i click on pink boom background goes pink boom
green boom blue boom right i can i can i can go to town on it look at me go
oh boy [Music] there we go cool alrighty so we have the ability to
effect the dom right we have the ability to affect the dom and
what the heck do i mean by affect the dom so what we see here

01:03
is that when i refresh all these changes go away all right
all these changes go away but when i click
there are some changes that are taking effect okay and
this at first is a pretty weird concept because when i click green right
when i click green is there anything right is there anything that has changed
in my files like has my css changed to now include green no
right no there's nothing that's magically changed in my files
and if i'm actually in here and i and i open this up in the inspector right
i open this up in the inspector i can see all this stuff in here make

01:04
this a little bit smaller i can see all this stuff that looks like html right
it looks like html right but it's not it's not really html it is the rendering
of our html what the browser does is it reads your html it reads your css
and it paints a lovely picture so what you are seeing here is a lovely picture
right that has been rendered it's a painting it is not
the actual html or the actual css right it is a rendering of that html and

01:05
that css if you had a painter and a painter sits down to to paint a
lovely model right a painter sits down they draw a lovely model right
we would never say that this painting is the model it is a
rendering of the model the painter saw the model right and
painted the model we would never say that this painting is the model
if the painter goes ahead and gives the model a clown nose right
gives them a clown nose the mod like the models that magically poof like there's
not magically like like a red nose that pops onto that model right this is the
rendering or the picture right it is the rendering or the picture
right of the model same thing is happening in the browser

01:06
the very first thing i just showed you right the very first thing i just showed
you right when we first were writing our html in css is that we opened up the h1
and we saw that the h1 was big bold black and beautiful just like myself
right we saw that very very first first time but did i ever write css
that made it bold that made it big right it did we never we never wrote that css
so where the heck did it come from where did that boldness
come from that that size come from right it came because what we're seeing
in the browser is not the direct carbon copy of the html and the css
it is the rendering of that html and that css in the browser

01:07
all right if i go ahead and i refresh right if i go ahead and i go in here and i
change this to twitch background picker right and i hit enter all right
i change this to twitch background picker has my code updated
like if i go back into my code right if i go back into my code
like am i going to see that youtube has been changed no
i didn't affect the files i affected the rendering of those files
right as soon as i come back and i refresh why does it go back to youtube
right why does it go back to youtube i refreshed why does it go back to youtube

01:08
chat because it's repainted it re-renders
exactly it re-reads the html it re-reads the css and it repaints the picture
so every single time you click refresh you're repainting the picture you're
re-rendering it's re-reading the html it's re-reading the javascript and it's
painting what we see here in the browser this concept is called the dom or the
document object model what you're seeing here on the on the on the right hand
side is not your html it is the rendering of that html all this that we
see here in the inspector it looks an awful lot like html but it's
not it's the rendering of the dom the document object model whenever we
refresh the page we re-render the dom right now the cool thing is
we can mess with the dom we can come along and make changes to it

01:09
right we can manipulate it we can add behavior and interaction to our sites
with javascript right with javascript right and what happens is that we're
manipulating the dom we're never actually manipulating our files so as
soon as we refresh all those changes to the dom go away okay
i like to think about my my grandma's famous tofu soup
right grandma has an amazing tofu soup has three ingredients water or water salt
and tofu all right the amazing tofu soup recipe and grandma makes this tofu soup
right we got a nice pot going it's steaming tasty it looks good right but i got

01:10
a jerk cousin and my jerk of a cousin comes along and they throw a tomato
into the soup when my jerk of a cousin comes along and
throws a tomato into the soup does the recipe magically update like we live in
harry potter land like does my recipe magically change no
the recipe doesn't change right the way that we the recipe doesn't change it's
just the rendering of that soup that has changed i could refresh that soup
i could throw it all out and then rebuild it from the recipe the
water the salt tofu and be back to my original state without the tomato
this is exactly what happens when you refresh the page we throw out the dom
everything that's in there gets thrown out and we re-read the instructions we

01:11
re-read the recipe we reread the html we re-read the css and we paint a new
picture so the beautiful thing is that javascript is our jerk of a
cousin it can come in it can mess with our soup right
it can mess with a soup right it can mess with the soup it can it can
it can make changes to it right but as soon as we refresh
it all gets thrown out and we re-render based on the recipe so in this example
javascript is the jerk of a cousin we can use javascript to change the dom to
manipulate the dom to change the words we see to change the colors we see to
make things move and spin but as soon right as soon as we refresh the page

01:12
all that goes out and we re-render the dom so keep that in mind as we're making
these changes with javascript we're not actually affecting the files we're not
actually making changes to our html or css we're just making changes to what we
see in the browser and we're making changes to this concept called the dom
at any point we refresh all those changes go away we restart by rereading
the html and css cool all right now that we have that concept down
let's go ahead and look at some actual code what you'll notice
is that i have three allies right i have three allies
i have an li with the id of purple an li with the id of green and an id
uh sorry and i lie with the id of blue right of blue and
this is going to be helpful because what we're actually doing is when we click

01:13
these individual lis we want different stuff to happen so let's look at our
javascript don't be overwhelmed tonight's not the night for it to make
all the sense we just want to talk through what we're seeing here all right
what i am saying is hey i'm looking up here i have these three very specific
sets of instructions remember i said javascript is about instructions
right when we're writing programming languages we're writing instructions let
me break down this instruction because it's human readable trust me it's human
readable let me show you the document is the thing that we were just talking
about right it's that rendering of the html and css when we look at this page
we're looking at the document right we're looking at the document
and what we are saying is hey when you're looking at this document

01:14
go get something that has the id of purple right so we're looking inside
that document and we're going to find something that has the id of purple
and we're saying hey when you click on it right when you click on it
i want you to run this set of instructions all right
i want you to run this set of instructions so if we look
we can actually see if we open up our inspector
we're looking at when i'm looking at this right here what am i looking at
i'm looking at this like stuff that looks like html over here what am i
actually looking at yeah i'm looking at the dom or we're
going to say document for right now right dom stands for the document object
model right so we're looking at it is there something

01:15
in this document that has the id of purple yeah it's right here look at this li
this li has the id of purple right and so what i'm saying when i look at
this code is i'm saying hey go look in that document
find something that has the idea of purple and when you click on it
run these sets of instructions so if we come down here
and we look at this set of instructions right we look at that set of
instructions called party purple the first set of instructions
right the first set of instructions says hey go back to that document
behind the body we know that all of our html documents have a body
and give it a background color that's that color right and then go again

01:16
right go again look in that document find the body again
and change the font color to white so we are writing instructions
in a way that's kind of maybe almost a little bit human readable right remember
tonight you're a sponge we're going to see these instructions over and over
again we're going to learn all the different bits and bobs and the
different pieces but we're doing something very specific we're saying hey
when somebody clicks on this thing in the document run these instructions
and the instructions are very clear make the background purple
and make the font color white that's it now these right here we call event

01:17
listeners you are listening for events right in this case the event is clicking
right that's the event we're listening for it's called it's called a click
right we're listening for that event called a click however
i never think of them as event listeners i always think of them as smurfs
yep think of them as smurfs now some people are like leon what the heck are
smurfs i know we have a global audience so let me show you what a smurf is real
quick these are smurfs they're little blue people that like
live in mushrooms and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] very popular back in the day they have
some new movies that came out recently but these are smurfs okay
when i am setting up an event listener what i am really doing

01:18
is putting a little smurf somewhere on the page in the dom if we have to use
the the actual term right so when i say hey
go to that page go into that document find something that has the idea of
purple we're gonna actually put a smurf so if we go and we look at our page
what we actually did is we put a little smurf here
right we got a little smurf here and this smurf
is just gonna sit there all day long on the block by themselves right and
when they hear the click right i'm coming in ready three two
one click the smurf goes ayo all right the smurf the smurf saw the click
right it saw the click and it was like hey yo right

01:19
and what it said it said hey yo give me some party purple
wanted the party purple folks wanted the party purple so
we went and got the party purple right the smurf was like hey yo
somebody clicked give me the party purple and so we went
and we got the party purple we went we made the background purple and we made
the font color white we outside we are outside i'm inside but
about to be outside all right now the cool thing is we actually set up
three different smurfs right we got three different smurfs here
we got the party purple smurf we got the party green smurf and the
party blue smurf we set up three event listeners three things that are
just sitting there all day long listening for clicks

01:20
right so if we go back and look it's actually three smurfs purple smurf
green smurf blue smurf they about that life they on the block by themselves
right and they hear the clicks and when they hear the clicks they tell a certain
set of instructions to run right they run the block
and when they hear that click they say you do this right now right you do this
right now and so when the green smurf hears the click
it says all right time to run these instructions the party green the party green
instructions and those instructions say hey go to that document find the body
make the background color green then do it again go to that document
find the body make the font color white and that's why when you click on the

01:21
green box it turns green and white it that smurf here is the click
and then make sure that those instructions are carried out
now you can call them smurfs you can call them event listeners that's up to you
all right they run these streets they run these events
and you can call them what you want you're going to hear me call them smurfs
sometimes you hear me call them event listeners but they're the same thing
they're just sitting there they're waiting they're listening for a click
and when they hear the click they tell certain things to pop off cool now
for homework we're not going to do it right now
tonight we're sponges we're not really going to type tonight right we're not
going to get our hands dirty this is this is a very rare class where i'm not

01:22
asking you to like immediately start coding or immediately start typing
because i want you to absorb right next class i got you tuesday's class i
got you thursday's class i gotcha is the rare class where we're not going to be
super typing along but for homework your goal is to come back to this code
and i want you to add another smurf right i want you to add
another smurf that's listening it's going to carry out some other instructions
right so that means you're going to have to add another li
that means you're going to have to add another smurf or event listener i don't
know why some people call it that and you have to add another set of
instructions we eventually give these sets of instructions a name called a
function but we're not there yet right and so that's gonna be that's gonna be
your homework so you're gonna come back you're gonna add a new smurf you're
gonna add a new set of instructions you're gonna add a new event listener right

01:23
and then once you do that and you feel all right i got it all to work
you're gonna save this somewhere else on your computer
and you're going to delete it all you're going to type it all out
and when you get stuck you're going to look at your copy of it
and then you're going to delete it all and you're going to redo it delete it
redo it delete it redo delete it until you don't need to look
at the example anymore you're going to get your active recall
in your spaced repetition in but the idea is that you're going to delete it
all do it again delete it all do it again until you don't need to look at
the reference anymore and you're not copying and pasting
for this next two weeks you might as well get rid of the
the cnv keys take them off we're not going to need them we don't copy and
paste when we're first learning a programming language the worst thing you

01:24
can do is copy and paste look at all these new characters right that we're
about to start using you got to get practice hitting those keys you got to
get practice with the way that you type it all out right so no copy and paste
not around here not this week two three weeks from now sure knock your
socks off but not right now you gotta get used to you gotta get to the floor
you gotta hit the keys you gotta make sure that things are going well all right
keep it moving now when learning to code and you're learning your first
programming language that's hilarious when you're first learning your first
programming language in this case javascript there are four
major things that you have to learn you have to learn variables

01:25
you have to learn conditionals you have to learn functions you have to learn
loops if you can understand variables conditionals functions and
loops you can build whatever you want you can build whatever the heck you want
just with those four things and so when people get into javascript
they think it's going to be like this wild adventure that they'll never be
able to lock down but it's really just getting good at like four things okay
right like four things objects will come a little bit later but
not really you don't even need to use them like those are extra right but it's
really just those four things you can learn those four things variables
conditionals functions and loops you can build whatever you want okay
everything else is a little bit extra they make our lives easier we get we get
other data structures that make our lives easier objects arrays things like
that they make our lives easier but you can build whatever you want with just

01:26
these four things right cool so tonight we're going to look at variables
and we're going to look at conditionals next week we'll add functions we'll add
loops and we'll keep moving along the pattern here all right so variables
what the heck are variables variables are what we can use
right to tell our program to remember a value for later on
we're going to need to store information right and be able to use that
information later on variables are the entity that we use
to store those values to be used later on okay
when we were talking about the zeros and ones and like the building up to a
modern computer one of the things a computer needs is memory like a place to
store stuff right and the reason why computers are so much

01:27
better than humans at a lot of this stuff is because humans forget right
computers can remember lots and lots of stuff because they have
memory and the main way we use this memory to start out are through variables
all right so when we are using a variable there are a couple different steps
so let's imagine we have a space for memory so i'm just going to draw a space
here it's going to call this memory all right this is our space for memory
when we are using variables we have two really fundamental steps
the first step we call declaration and the second step we call assignment

01:28
declaration is what we use right it's what we use to create a space in memory
right declaration enables us to create a space in memory
i like to think of variables as data buckets all they are are buckets
of data so you create a bucket you put something into that bucket
and then later on when you want it you can go back and pull it out of the bucket
that's all variables are they're creating buckets that we can store stuff
in and at some future date we can go and take stuff out of the bucket okay so
we have a keyword here called let and in javascript there are some special
words they're called reserved words there are words that javascript looks

01:29
out for and understands when it sees the word let that's like
alarm bells going off for javascript saying hey hey hey hey wait a minute
somebody is trying to create a bucket a bucket of data
right a bucket of data and so when it sees that keyword let
right when it sees the keyword let it creates a new space in memory and so
right here i've done my declaration step i've created a new space in memory
called age right so if we could actually look into the computer's memory
right now there would be a space that is empty that is marked for age

01:30
right now right now is there anything stored in that bucket called age
there is not at this moment in time there is nothing stored in that bucket
that takes us to our next step which we call assignment
with the assignment stage right with the assignment step we can actually assign
that bucket of value like we can put something in it so here you can see i'm
going to set age equal to 25. that's the same thing as putting the number 25
into our bucket all right and now that bucket is stored in memory
and at any point in time i want to retrieve that age i can
right i can ask the computer hey what's stored in the age bucket
and it will give me 25. right the name we give this is called a

01:31
variable it's just a bucket right the bucket that holds stuff right
and there are two steps with variables where you create the space in memory
called declaration and where you assign it a value called assignment
cool now the cool thing is once we start assigning stuff to memory we can use it
however we please so uh let's pretend that we're facebook right
facebook stores a lot of stuff right facebook knows your age they probably
know your location they know your last sexual partner uh they know your birth
date they know a lot of stuff about you right and so the
people always freak out about this one uh it's true right so think about this
facebook knows your location right they can see two phones in the same location

01:32
for the night right and then those two phones don't go back
to the same location at night ever again so they know who you're sleeping with
if you got that facebook app on your phone so let's be real right so
they're storing age maybe they also want
to store your location right so let's go ahead and declare a variable called
location so we'll say let location that's our declaration step and so we go
ahead and create a new space in memory called location beautiful
and then the next step right the next step is assigning it a location let's just
say uh boston right so we assigned to the location of boston
so this first step was the declaration step

01:33
and this step was the assignment now in memory is boston beautiful
so now we have all these things in memory and what we can do and why this is so
cool is we can start to use these things that are stored in memory i can say bob
age sorry let's just say bob is age right bob is not in location right
so what happens here is we're trying to use these variables
so instead of it saying age bob is age it would say bob is 25.

01:34
and instead of saying location right we would say bob is not in boston
all right the beautiful thing here is that these different variables this age
this location will be different for each person
but we could still have the same use we could still say bob is blank
right bob is not in blank and we could change the age as they get older we
could change the location as their location changes but our actual use
doesn't have to change and so the beautiful thing is that variables enable
us to store values to use later on and we can use them throughout our entire
program sometimes we're plopping them into the dom sometimes we're adding to
them sometimes we're subtracting from them sometimes we're reassigning them or
changing them so variables at a low level are just buckets that we put data into

01:35
right and eventually we can reuse that data if we want all right
when you are naming your variables right when you are naming your variables
you're most likely gonna have to stick to a convention the convention that i
use is something called camelcase i use camelcase on all of my html my css
my javascript throughout my entire code basis it's always camelcase
and the idea is that the first word in your variable is lowercase
and then every other word is capitalized so here you can see number of apples
number is lowercase of and apples is capitalized right now with this variable

01:36
what is this part here that i circled called chat what's that part called
what's the part i just i just circled called nice called declaration exactly and
what is this part called yeah it's called assignment exactly it's
called assignment so if i had memory again
if i were looking in our memory we would see a new space in memory that was
declared called number of apples right and inside that we would assign it
the value of a nine beautiful now we can store all kinds of data
in our variables like those data buckets

01:37
can all hold all kinds of different data it's all data it just has different
types we've seen two different types of data
so far can anybody guess the two types of data that we've seen so far
we've seen two different kinds of data so far at least two
yeah we saw numbers like the number nine
or the age of 25 and then we saw strings
strings are just a fancy way of saying a
piece of text right so we saw the string of boston right and so
those are two of the data types we're going to learn first first on but there
are so many others so let's explore numbers and strings for right now and
we'll get to the others in future classes all right strings
in javascript will always be surrounded by quotes right you can use
double quotes or you can use single quotes and in a

01:38
little bit a couple classes we'll also see how to use tix for template literals
but we're not there yet right so our strings will always be wrapped in double
quotes single quotes or ticks but it's up to you it's like your
preference of what you want to use the thing that you have to remember however
is whatever you use on the outside you cannot use on the inside without
doing a trick all right so here i have they purchased it
and i have single quotes on the outside and double quotes on the inside so we're
good but if i had done double quotes on the outside we would have run into a
very specific problem let me show you the problem we would have run into
so i'm going to type this out i'm going to use double quotes on the outside they

01:39
purchase and then i'm going to say it right they purchased it what happened here
this isn't the the orange that it should be
yeah we got two separate strings here right we have two separate strings this
first string is day space right and the second string is space it
because those quotes terminated it closed the first string
and then there's some empty stuff and then there's another string
so whenever you use the same quotes on the outside is on the inside you're
going to wind up breaking it up into two separate strings now for the folks that
did the homework what do you think javascript is trying to [Music]
think that purchased is what is javascript going to try and see if purchased is
yeah javascript is going to look for a variable

01:40
called purchased right it's looking for a variable called purchase but when i
hit enter i get a syntax error unexpected
identifier it's because there's nothing that has been what called purchase
there's a very specific word we have to say here there's nothing that has been
what that is called purchased yeah there's nothing that has been declared
that is called purchase there's nothing in memory there's no space in memory
with the name purchased so it's going to get an error because there's nothing in
memory called purchased nice all right there is a trick however we can escape
our quotes so if i go ahead and put a backslash before each quote it escapes it
it means it tells javascript hey ignore these double quotes right ignore these

01:41
double quotes so that i can have my cake and eat it too it's called escaping so
those backslashes enable us to escape those
quotes so it doesn't create two separate strings and a variable that's not
declared we can keep our double quotes on the outside and our double quotes on
the inside we just have to escape nice same thing happens with single quotes if
we replace these with uh single quotes then our contraction would end here and
we'd wind up with the same problem excuse me
now if you're like whoa we can escape what else can we do well there is
something else we can do we can do these things right here if we do escape n
what that does is it's the same thing as like hitting enter
right so it'll give you a carriage return if you do escape t
it'll give you some tabbing right it'll give you a give you a tab

01:42
now why do you think i put a lovely like warning light down here
why do you think i have a lovely warning light
that sounds an awful lot like css yes let's go
we don't fire chat let's go we don't get got we go get
exactly that's really close to css like spacing stuff returning stuff i don't
know that's a little too close for me it sounds a little too much like css it
sounds like we're getting a little too close with uh violating separation of
concerns so yeah i don't know i think i'll stay with that from now
we go get exactly all right so we talked about strings let's talk about
numbers all right let's talk about numbers uh so in javascript we have two
kinds of numbers that you're gonna run into a lot you're gonna run into
integers which are just like whole numbers and you're gonna run into
floated values which are numbers with decimal places so integers like our

01:43
whole numbers our floated values have decimal places
whenever you hear somebody talk about floats in javascript or most programming
languages they just mean a number with decimal places there's a little bit more
nuance to it but that's what they're talking about
in javascript you can also have signed numbers
people are like freaking out no floats no
i loved all the tweets after class on uh on tuesday they had me giggling
yeah we have two different kinds of signed numbers in in javascript we can
have positive numbers and we could have negative numbers cool
in javascript we have uh different types of arithmetic right
different operators that handle our math so in javascript we use the plus sign

01:44
for addition we use the hyphen for subtraction
we use the asterisk for multiplication we use the forward slash for division
and then the last one the last one is the percent and that is
our modulus it's how we get a remainder now before we get into modulus people
are going to freak out leon i thought you said there's no math you don't need
math to be a web developer a full stack web
developer you just don't need it there's very little math that you're going to
ever really realistically get into but you need to know how to do basic
arithmetic you do need to know how to do like basic addition subtraction uh it's
gonna come in handy so i don't think we're gonna just go off the cliff into like
discrete math or anything like that we're not we're we're going to stick
with the basics here folks quick maths exactly quick maths

01:45
uh modulus it's how we get a remainder right nope that's why i have a phone leon
is why we it's how we get a remainder so chat if i did 10 mod 4 what would i get
if i did 10 mod 4 what would i get we would get 2 right because four
would go into ten twice and we'd have two left over and we could
actually use the console to do this too right we go to the console we can do 10
mod four and we see we have two left over right if i did ten mod six
you can see that i would get four right six goes into ten one time and there's
four left over all right so modulus is just the remainder right
and a lot of people were like leon what would why would i ever need modulus
well modulus actually comes in handy a lot

01:46
not just to get remainders but there's something really cool that if you
understand how remainders work uh that you can you can figure something out let
me let me show you real quick let me do let me do two things here and see if you
can guess what i'm getting at so let's go ahead and do let's go ahead and do 7
mod 2 and i'm going to do 8 mod 2. what do you think i could use modulus to
figure out yeah check got it we could use modulus
to figure out even and odd right if you use modulus with the number two so you
take some number and you mod it by 2 and you get a remainder of anything like
anything that's not 0 you know that that's an odd number but if you get 0
you know that that's an even number right so very quickly you can use
modulus to determine if something is even or odd and this actually becomes

01:47
the cornerstone of a very famous programming challenge called fizzbuzz
what fizzbuzz says is print the numbers between 1 and a hundred if the number is
divisible by three print fizz if the number is visible by five print buzz the
numbers divisible by three and five print fizz buzz and so this is like the
cornerstone of that you would just do the number mod 5 the number sorry mod 3
you do the number in mod 5 and then you do the number by mod 15 or 3 n5 right
and so we're not there yet but this modulus does actually come up it helps
folds for figuring out odd and even and also pretty helpful when it comes to
some of the like quintessential coding challenges that we'll be getting to very
shortly all right let's take a look at a not so
great calculator and then we will go ahead and um take a break so i'm going

01:48
to go ahead and open up my code for the not so great calculator i'm
going to go ahead and close our uh background picker you can hear all
the smurfs slowly dying in the background you hear them no god
no god please no no no his name gargamel i think yeah oh no all right
it's too loud i gotta fix that i gotta figure out i thought it was um i thought
it was just the sound alerts that were loud but i guess it's the whole system
settings that are allowed i'll figure it out
you're awake now gotcha there you go welcome back
all right let's go ahead and open up this simple calculator all right so

01:49
i'm going to open this in the browser and uh here's a very simple calculator
if i click zero i get zero if i click plus three it goes
up by three a little bit bigger if i click plus nine it goes up by nine if i
click minus two it goes down by two since i can click right all right
since i can click on four different things what do i know that i have four of
since i can click on four different things what do you know i have four of
yeah i got four smurfs or four event listeners right whatever you want to
call them right i have at least four smurfs or at least four event listeners
that are listening for these clicks right so if i click zero that smurf is
telling something to happen if i click list plus three another telling
something else to happen if i click plus nine another is telling something else

01:50
to happen if i click minus two another is telling something else to happen so
these are our event listeners now if we go ahead and look at our code
we can see that there are four different lis there's pumpkin there is
domino's pizza right then we have zebra and we have can't think of anything
because i ran out of ideas all right cool so we have these four allies with
their own ids so we can use those ids when it comes
to our javascript we can target those specific allies right we can target the
specific allies everybody's saying did you get a sponsorship no i just really
like dominoes all right now once again remember we're sponges
don't let this be overwhelming we're gonna break through
every single bit that's here happening all right once again

01:51
we're saying go to the document right the dom right
we're going to we're going to the document we're going to the dom we're
going to that rendering of our html and css
and we're going to look for something that has the id of pumpkin
the query selector is just another way of finding elements and so here we're
telling it just like we would find stuff in css basically is what we can use
inside a query selector so when you see the octothorpe
pumpkin you know we're looking for something that has the id of pumpkin
and when we find it we put our smurf on the block right
that's us putting the smurf on the block so just to run through that again
we're looking in the dom like the rendering of our html and css we're
looking for the thing that has the idea of pumpkin and when we find it
we place our smurf right and the cool thing

01:52
all right the cool thing is that this smurf right this smurf
can actually change right can actually change what it's looking for
right it can change what it's looking for
all right so right now it's at the click and so we're seeing we're seeing
the difference here is query selector and get element by id interchangeable
they are there are slight differences we'll get to those later on remember
we're sponges tonight doesn't matter where baddies are writing bad code
all right the cool thing is we're using this add event listener where we saw
before on click guess what on click can only do what on click
can only i'm gonna how can i time out for a less amount of time
when i said little caesars trying to time them out mods can you
time them out just for a few seconds thank you yeah right now we

01:53
don't please don't do that we have an event listeners listening for
a click right but we we can we can we can change it right on click can only
handle clicks ad event listener can handle every single type of event
right so let's change this to mouse enter all right we're gonna change this to
mouse enter i'm gonna save i'm gonna come back i'm gonna refresh beautiful
now we have our lovely smurf sitting here all right we got our lovely smurf
fitting sitting here i'm gonna hit the plus three right just so you can see
that there's some three here but watch i'm not gonna click
actually i'll show you down here look this is me clicking plus three
get the click see the click plus three look as i move my mouse in not clicking
it goes back to zero right plus three you hear the click moving my mouse in

01:54
boom back to zero right so these are different events right
these are different events and the beautiful thing is that leona asmr
and the cool thing is that when you use add event listener you get to use all
the events mouse enter mouse leave click
double click right there all these other things you can use and so as we kind of
continue on we won't ever really use on click because it doesn't give us the
flexibility right but what we said here is hey
look in the dom find the thing that has the id of pumpkin
put a smurf on it or an event listener on it that's listening for this type of
event and when the smurf sees or hears that event
it tells this set of instructions to run right so this set of instructions down
here says to do something to total and then to do something else let's talk

01:55
about this first part here total equals zero anybody know what this is called
so this is called very something very specific that you might have picked up
from the from the homework it's close to assignment close to
assignment yes it's re-assignment it's reassignment right if we look up here
we can see that we declared a variable called total
and we assigned it the value of zero here we're reassigning it to zero
right we're reassigning it to zero if we look at the other sets of
instructions we're doing other things to that variable called total
right here i'm adding three to total so if total was zero
i'm doing zero plus three and reassigning total to now be three

01:56
right let's let's go and open up the inspector and play around with that idea
all right so we have a space in memory let's go and create our console let's go
ahead and sign total let total equal zero great
oh sorry let's let's do a different variable um let's go and do
because we already have total we're running the page already has total let's
go uh let's call let age equal 25. there we go so what we've created now
is a space and memory called age and it's equal to 25. if i want
i got i did get got right if i want i can
reassign age to be some other value so i
can go ahead let's see what age is right now if i hit age and i hit enter

01:57
i get 25 right we can see that 25 timed out sorry y'all violin
i'm so sorry i won't do that again i apologize
somebody just said papa john's in all caps and i went i like i think the mods
deleted it and i timed them out [Laughter] like i went to time them out but the
mods already deleted it this is a domino stream folks all right
so i type in i typed in uh age right i typed in age
and i got 25 back right i got 25 back right y'all want i'm going to find y'all
i'm just going to go back to the logs bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
bam bam bam bam bam bem bomb i'm going to set up an event listener
that'll ban y'all that's over that's what we'll do well
we'll on on office hours you come back we'll write some javascript that bans
all the people shouting out other pizza places when this is a domino stream i'll

01:58
show you how to code it and then we'll just let it run and we'll do it that way
all right so we have age equaling 25. i can reassign age to be something else
right here we go age equals 30. when i do that right when i do that
the spot that was 25 is now 30 right that space and memory has been
reassigned to 30. cool we can also go ahead and add right you can also add
all right so we can do age equals age plus five if i hit enter
what is the space and memory now gonna hold
right if i hit enter right what is the space in memory going to hold

01:59
go in a chat for me 35 exactly we've reassigned it now to be
35 the reason why it's 35 is because age at this point in time was 30.
so i do 30 plus 5 which is 35 and that 35 is what winds up reassigning age
right what winds up reassigning age right we took a value we added to it and
we reassigned it cool we can also do a different slightly
different way of doing this right we could also do this age plus equals 10
right and where would we be at yeah we'd be at 45.
we just added 10 to our age it reassigned age to be 10 more
so that space in memory would now be 45. cool so there are different ways of

02:00
doing the reassignment there are different ways of adding incrementally
we can add by one by doing plus plus we'll see all of this don't worry we're
gonna see all of these examples in way more depth with way more things going
forward tonight i'm just trying to show you some cool stuff
right you're not getting it that's okay i'm just trying to show you some cool
things this idea of variables we can reassign them we can do different stuff
with them it's dope cool so let's take a little bit let's take a
look at this code and then we will um we'll take a break cool
so we have this variable called total right that we're going to reassign as we
go along and we have all of these different smurfs or
event listeners right so we have these event listeners that we click on the
smurf hears them and does something right so let's click on plus three
and walk through the code of what just happened

02:01
all right what what line was the event listener that just heard that
what line had the event listener that heard the plus three yeah it's line
let's look if we look the plus three was oh would you imagine
that domino's pizza ah who would have thought right it was domino's pizza
all right which is line four right so we heard the click
on domino's pizza and when we heard the click when that smurf heard the click
on domino's pizza right that plus three right when it heard the click on
domino's pizza what set of instructions did the smurf tell to run

02:02
what set of instructions did the smurf tell to run ayo jumanji exactly now
as as we've learned there is only one independence day
and as we learned there's only one jumanji all right so it ran jumanji so are we
going to run this block of code we're going to run this set of instructions
no not going to run the set of instructions we're going to run the set
of instructions that have the name jumanji great and the first thing we do
what is line 14 doing what do we call this
we just learned this what is what do we call line 14 what is happening on line
14 what do we call this yeah we're reassigning total to whatever
what whatever total was it is now total plus three
so this is the very first time we clicked we know total started off at

02:03
zero so at the end of line 14 total is what
by the end of when we get done with line 14 total is at what yeah
total is now at three great so our last line of code let's
read it out and see if we can understand what's happening here we're gonna go
back to the dom we're gonna go back to the document the rendering that we've
been talking about all night we're gonna look for something that has the id
of place to put results and then we're going to put some text inside of it
and that text that we're going to put inside is total
but right now total is what total is three dreamin

02:04
zero nine zero four thank you for the hydration cheers to you ah thank you
it's three right so let's see we can figure this out go to the document
find the thing that has the idea of place to put result
and then put inside of it the number three all right let's look is there
something if we look inside the dom is there something with the id
of place that was ah here we go here is a span that has the id
of place to put result so we're going to put something in there
we're going to put some text i'm going to put some text in there
all right we're going to put some text in there and that text we're going to
put in there right now is the number three
so that's why we see the dom right here and we see that we see the three here

02:05
and we see the three there because we've updated it right we put that we put the
bit of text three in there all right if we go ahead and click
something else let's click the plus nine we can see the dom update in real time
right we click these other things we're seeing
the dom update in real time right this is the beauty of javascript right this
is the beauty of javascript it is the jerk it can come along and mess with the
dom in real time but if i refresh what happens if i refresh what happens
it all resets right i'll refresh boom it all goes back to nothing poof
all the work we put in all the dom manipulation that happened it completely
resets it goes back let's look right now there's nothing inside right there's
nothing inside that place to put results if we look right if we look at our html

02:06
it's because there is nothing in the span to begin with
i could put something in here i could put let's let's put put bob in here
all right let's put bob we'll put the we'll put the word bob in
here it's going to cause some problems let's put bob in here let's say let's
come back let's refresh right now now the dom starts off
with bob in there right the dom starts off with bob here right
and if we were to click anything but the zero we would run into issues right if
we click plus three now we're good but let me refresh and let me do plus nine
right plus nine right let's go ahead and do plus three let me refresh here

02:07
wait a minute let's refresh wait a minute plus nine how to go from bob to nine
how'd it go from bob to nine bob plus nine should be nine bob
so there's some some interesting things that are eventually going to happen here
we're eventually going to get into this idea of strings and numbers right but
was total actually bob let's think about this was bob actually total no
total was zero total had nothing to do with what i put in this span the start
total doesn't care what was in that span to start
right bob never it never even crossed the mind of it to be bob

02:08
right because bob was just what was inside the span but we don't care
there's there's nothing here that says worry about the span it just
says total is zero and do zero plus nine
now if we do up here and we start acting reckless right we put bob up here and
set bob the total and we come back and then we start playing games right then
we're going to get into some weird situations where we're running into like
strings being added to numbers and they're different types and this gets weird
right we can always go back to zero and we're in a good shape right because zero
it doesn't care what what total was it just completely reassigns it back to zero
here we were seeing what's called string concatenation but i just want to show
you that because one of the reasons why people struggle a
little bit with javascript is eventually there's like some of these like weird
things that pop up but we're going to spend a lot of time on that stuff we're

02:09
going to see all that in the future but for now let's set this back to zero
and we just know that when we click on something
we're firing an event listener that event listener tells some instructions
to run and we can see these instructions
doing some sort of reassignment and then putting that reassigned stuff into the
dom all right let's take a well-deserved break when we
come back from the break we're going to talk about making decisions using
conditionals so let's go and take a break
put five minutes on the clock if you're new around here we like to be healthy
like to take our time if you're able to please get up move around stretch
hydrate kiss some babies walk some dogs and i'll see you back here in five

02:10

02:12

02:13
he loves tech this is great hey i'm glad you think so in five [Music] do yo
bob looks how i felt this week happy on the outside dead on the inside
did you know that gargamel was trying to capture smurf to melt down into gold
i just knew there was something weird while why he was chasing them that's
pretty cool i didn't know that will you solve the remaining layouts
during office hours yep we'll get through most of them during office

02:14
hours i played breath of the wild of course i didn't finish it though but
yeah i played it you ready of course we always raid
i don't really know too much about aldrin ringgit i'm not i don't really i
like heard of it but i haven't looked into it much yet
how many teacups do you have a lot thoughts on typescript i use it
different tools right different tools for different jobs i do like pip club
cool all right folks come on back come on back

02:15
you don't post office hours on youtube i don't so you show up
you can always watch the vods on youtube they're on there for 60 days
come on back folks come on back when's the cs go so we're gonna be up
hopefully soon we're just working again the last touches going
i want to be able to like be done with it and then never have to like touch it
for a while cool all right folks get in here alrighty
did you ever get tired of us no that's always fun
all right come on folks get him back in here and uh let's keep pushing all right
talk about the big four right we had variables conditionals loops and
functions uh so far we talked about variables now let's talk about the next
which is those conditionals right those conditionals are what we're going

02:16
to use to make decisions alrighty so here we have a value that is either true or
false right we have the ability to say all right
if whatever happens inside of here is true we will do what happens inside of the
curly braces all right now if what is inside here is not true we do
not do what's inside the curly braces and so what we have to realize is that
if we want to be able to use conditionals and make decisions we
actually have to be able to make comparisons all right so to make
comparisons we got to learn how to compare stuff in javascript the idea is
to be able to using these values right using these values be able to
see whether or not something is equal to

02:17
something else if something is less than
something else something is greater than something else right
and the idea here is that we have to figure out all these different ways to
do comparison alrighty here is the first thing that we're
comparing right here we're comparing the number nine to
the number nine so is the number nine equal to the number nine is that true or
false it's true right the number nine is indeed equal to the
number nine so that is true all right look at the next one is the number seven
equal to the number three no that is false the number seven is not
equal to the number three uh so that we would give us a false value but where it
gets a little odd with javascript is this idea that we can compare a string
to another string right we can say all right is the string hello

02:18
equal to the string hello right and in javascript that's actually
true the one string is equal to the other string right so they're both true
here so what we want to start doing is take a little bit deeper look and how we
make these comparisons how we figure out these equalities and move through it
all right so here i have done something very specific what have i done
right here what is this right here yeah i've done i've done an assignment
right there's no actually there's actually no declaration step there right
so let's pretend that there was a declaration step that said like let x
right that was just strictly assignment right and what we're noticing is that i

02:19
used one equal sign for that assignment right i used one equal sign for that
assignment what we're going to notice is when it
comes to comparison we're going to use two or three equal signs not one so
something that we actually be very careful about if we ever just use one
equal sign we're doing assignment again but two or three equal signs is how we
do comparison all right so wherever we see x here we know x is what
whenever we see x we know x is what in this case x is three nice so
when we look at this we're saying is three
equal to the number eight so is number three
equal to the number eight but when you see two equal signs it's just the value

02:20
right just the value so is number three equal to the number eight in value no
they are not equal in value so we get false
where javascript gets a little tricky is when we look at this next line
x is equal to number 3. so does number three answer the first
question first here does number three equal string three in value in value
this number three equals string 3 in value
the answer to that question is yes they are the same in value 3 is 3.
however when we have 3 equal signs we're not just looking for value
we're also looking for type one in this case is a number this is number three
this over here however is what what is that one over there

02:21
yeah it's string three it's string three exactly
one is a number and one is a string and when you have three equal signs
you're saying i want to compare stuff not only on value
but i also want to compare stuff on type so in this case it passes the first
check they are the same in value but they are not the same in type so we
would get false however when we come down to this last one here
we get to compare does number three equal number three in value chat
is number three equal number three in value yes
and does number three equal number three in type
yeah they're both numbers so that would be true right so we have to remember in

02:22
javascript one equal sign has nothing to do with comparison it's just assignment
two equal signs we're looking at value three equal signs we're looking at value
and type cool all right we got a bunch of other ones
down here uh and these scare a lot of people so we're just not going to do
them tonight we'll come back to them maybe next class or sometime next week
so we're going to skip those for now we'll come back to those because that's
where people just close the computer and run away so we'll we'll save those for
another day all right remember the whole reason we cared about these
these like conditional statements right these these this idea of something is
equal to or or eventually greater than and less than right is because we want
to be able to do stuff based on certain things being true we want to be able to
make decisions using conditionals remember we said the big four variables

02:23
conditionals loops and functions this is the basis of conditionals and how we
make decisions and they actually just follow one really important rule
if whatever is inside the parentheses is true
we do what happens inside the curly braces that's it
so if what is inside the parentheses is true we wind up doing what is inside of
the curly braces this hey thank you for the hydration cheers to you
all right so let's take a look at this here we go
there are actually three different steps
that you can have when using conditional syntax if you use an if
and this condition is true you do what's inside the curly braces

02:24
and then you stop that's it you're done as soon as you hit something that's true
you stop you don't move on to any other values right however if
this condition was not true right if it was not true
we would move on to the else if and check to see if this was true right
so if this was false we move on to the elsif
and the cool thing is you can actually have as many elsifs as you want so you
could have an if and then an elsif and elsif and elsif and elsif and elsif and
elsif and you're just checking more and more stuff right but let's say the if
was false the else if was false the elf would auto magically run
right it would automatically run automagically run right it doesn't need

02:25
a condition it just runs if everything else above it was false
see a lot of people hitting bingo right now i got you i knew what's happening
all right so keep that in mind you can have an if
as many else's as you want and then just one else and you don't need to have an
else it's just if everything else was false the else will just automatically
run right it just will it doesn't need to check anything it just runs so it's
typically used for like a default all right so let's look at this in action
all right we're going to declare a variable const pizza equals dominos all right
pizza equals dominos uh because we're declaring a variable
called dominos now pizza called dom that's set equal to dominoes right that

02:26
is assigned the value of dominoes now why did i use this keyword here called
const anyway that did the the homework know
why i called this const pizza not let pizza because const or constants
it don't change it'll never change it will always be dominoes it's not
changing to anything else it will never be reassigned it can't be reassigned
when you have a const that keyword that's declaring a variable
but you said as a const it can't be reassigned right so just like pizza will
always be dominoes it can't be reassigned right so if
you're gonna declare a variable you can use let or stuff that will change or
const for stuff that will never change like pizza being equal to dominoes
all right so we have our const of pizza equaling

02:27
dominoes so let's check out our first if here uh does pizza equal
papa john's in value and type hell no right so if the if is not true
we move on to the else if right we move on to the elsif so here we're looking at
the elsif and we say hey does pizza equal dominoes in value and type
that is true right we can see that pizza
does indeed equal dominoes and value and
type so print it to the console would be
all aboard the train the flavor town the console is this thing right here
right this is the console we would see something be printed here that says all
aboard the train to flavor town right cool what if
what if we didn't know how to spell dominoes right
what do we spell dominoes with an e we're new around these parts we spelled

02:28
it with an e what would happen what would eventually wind up being printed
to the console we'll be printed to the console
it would be what are you even doing with your life exactly that is what would be
printed to the console because right if there was an e here
uh pizza would not equal papa john's so the if would be not true we move on to
the elsif in this case pizza would not be equal to dominoes because we spelled
it wrong right so then we go to the else did the else need to check anything to
run did the else need to check anything to run no it just ran
and we printed to the console what are you even doing with your life cool
so this is the idea you can have ifs as many else's as you want and then else's
we're gonna see a lot of this in action we're gonna get a lot of hands-on

02:29
keyboard time with this stuff uh so we'll see a lot of this in the next
coming weeks all right what is the danger between assignment and comparison
why do i throw that up here with with like big red
alerts what is it what is the danger between assignment and comparison
yeah if we accidentally used one equal sign instead of two or three we're going
to run into a very specific error let's actually uh copy this code from here
and i'm going to put it into my console let's go ahead and copy it
and so i'm just going to paste it into my console and i'm going to hit enter
so we can see that it printed to the console all aboard the train to flavor town

02:30
right all aboard the train the flavor town but let's run it again
let's run it again but instead of doing three equal signs here let's do one
right let's do one and if we hit enter what assignment to a constant variable
somebody tried to change dominoes to papa john's like what were they thinking
right what happened here yeah right here when there's one equal sign
what just tried to happen when there's one equal sign what what
what just happened there since it's one equal sign it tried to reassign
right it tried to reassign it tried it tried to set pizza to papa john's
but const said hell no pizza is constant and will always be

02:31
dominoes you can't change it to anything else right that reassignment did not
come through this is a domino's household this is a domino's boot camp
and they got got all right so we got to be careful if you ever do
this one equal sign what you're going to wind up doing is not comparison right
it's not going to be comparison it's going to be reassignment so be careful
don't get got when you're doing comparison you need
two or three equal signs not one one is assignment you got got mozilla thank you
all right the cool thing is we can actually put multiple conditions
in our conditional logic right so if we my pencil go if we want to check for two

02:32
things at the same time we can check so if name equals bruce and
your parents are dead then we can turn off the bat signal because batman is here
right so that's that's both both have to be true
and if both are true we can turn off the bat signal uh because batman is there
cool so double ampersand is and both sides
have to be true right the left hand side to be true and the right-hand side has
to be true we could also have or right leona spider-cause confirmed
the outside huh all right we can have or
right or means that just one of them has to be true so if day equals saturday or
right or day equals sunday then we know that it's
the weekend right only one has to be true so we're gonna start to see our
conditional logic get a little bit more complex we can do just straight up right

02:33
just got straight up one value that we're looking for right
one value that we're looking for or we can look for
both values we can look for either or values and so these conditions can get a
little bit more complicated over time all right so to kind of demonstrate this
and this will be our i think this will be our last example for tonight uh and
then we'll we'll kind of lay out what the next week will look like um
and what i want to start off with is this example here called class weekend
or boring day all right class weekend or boring day
someone said is javascript backend javascript can run on the back end and
the front end what we're looking at right now is front end or client-side
javascript yeah all right so we're going to open up class weekend or boring day
let's go to our starter code if you're new around here you need the
starter code you can do exclamation point discord join our discord agree to
the rules and you'll see all the starter code in our follow along materials

02:34
channel all right so i'm going to open up the class weekend or boring day
all right so here we have if we look a form right we have a form
and that form says day of the week for the label and then we have an input
for the day of the week right it has the
id of day but it's a place for us to put the day of the week
we have a button that we could eventually click that'll that'll help us
check to see if the day of the week equals something and then we have a an
id called place to see so the idea here is if we open this in the browser
a little bit bigger what i want to be able to do is put in a day of the week
right put in a day of the week i'm going to be able to click the button
and i want to see if it's class all right i want to see if it's class

02:35
the weekend or boring right is it a class day a weekend or a boring day
all right so if we look and we have this button that we're going to click called
check what do we know that we need what do we know we need if we're just
looking is what do we know we need we need a smurf exactly we need an event
listener that's going to listen that's going to listen for that click now
what else do we need this program to do what do we need this program to do
it's going to listen for the click but then what are the instructions that it's
going to do yeah i need to do a couple of things it's
going to need to be able to get the value out of the input
right we need some way of getting the value out of the input
once we have that value that was in the input we need to figure out we need to

02:36
do some comparison some conditional logic exactly see how many people saying
comparison we need to do some conditional logic some comparison we
need to see if the day equals tuesday or thursday because then we'll be in class
we need to see if the day equals saturday or sunday because that would be
a weekend and if it's not a tuesday or thursday or a
saturday or sunday we need to just say boring right and make it sure it says
boring all right so what we just talked through right there is something we call
pseudo code i didn't really use any like technical
jargon maybe other than like event listener right
but what we just did is we just talked out loud about what our program is going
to do we call this pseudo code whenever i start to write a program
the first thing i do is i talk through my pseudo code yeah it's like a story

02:37
about the program exactly right like a story about the about what i'm about to
do and often i'll sit here and i'll talk to bob right or i'll talk to my rubber
duck right and i will talk through what i want my code to do in just plain
english we call this pseudo pseudocode so eventually next week we're going to
spend a lot of time with pseudocode you're going to write out in plain plain
language the steps that you want your code to take right
so that you can then fill in with the actual javascript
and early on in your javascript career you'll write pseudocode and spend a hell
of a lot of time googling stack overflowing trying to figure out like
what the actual syntax is to solve the challenge that you have so it's not that
you have to have like all this stuff in your brain you write out your pseudo
code and then you can look up how to do that thing

02:38
through your research right and the beautiful thing is if you get good at
pseudo code right some people are like how do you spell that let me pull it up
real quick for you pseudocode the cool thing is if you get
good at pseudo code right you can program in any language
right we're learning javascript but the skills are transferable most languages
are going to have variables conditionals
functions and loops they might call them slightly different things but they're
going to have all that same stuff and if you get good at writing pseudo
code and figuring out how to fill in the
syntax based off of your pseudo code you can
code in any language so it's a really powerful skill and the biggest skill
that i want you to have as we start going through the next couple weeks
we're going to spend a lot of time on it cool
but let's uh let's jump back to our code here
all right so we kind of talk through what's happening in the html we know
there's a form where we need to get stuff out of this input that has the id
of day we know we have a button that we need to put a smurf on smurf on so we

02:39
can hear the click and we know we want to eventually put the result like
probably in this h2 or something cool so here we go i have some
pre-written logic here i have my smurf i have the ability to get the value
out of the input this is how you get the value of the input the input had the id
of day i can get the value out of it so whatever was put into that input i can
get the value out what i want you to do is i want you to take five minutes
and i want you to write some code look at the conditionals we had in the
slides exclamation point slides and i want you to say whether it is a class day
a boring day sorry a class day a weekend or a boring day all right put five

02:40
minutes on the clock and you're gonna try getting this done music on for you
dig deep you got this get some practice look at the slides use your googling
you got this oh geez the slow jazz what happened to no typing today you got got
i'm not too excited thank you for the hydration cheers to you
whatever whatever day you want everyone's like i thought you weren't
typing today did y'all put your keyboards away like they're just stored

02:41
away in the closet yeah god what can i say got here with the duns
how are you unwinding after class sessions these days
i i haven't been i've just been i've been working
people saw me i had it focused at northeastern channel like one o'clock in
the morning i've been grinding folks i'll work to get this stuff done
can you repeat the assignment it's to make this work you're going to write
your conditionals to see if it's a class day a weekend or a boring day

02:42
i get my sleep i don't skip in my sleep about what you do with the time that you
have awake about three minutes left folks you got this dig deep
what's the difference between inner text and inner html one just puts text one
can put uh a full bit of html like you can put
like a whole div or a section or a paragraph yeah
do you have a full time with that job on top of teaching yeah i teach i teach
during the day too i run uh i help run another boot camp during the day
a non-profit boot camp for folks of color called resilient coders
what's the difference between java and js they're two different completely

02:43
different languages we're actually going to talk a lot about that
um the first the people that wrote javascript are like hey what's a popular
language oh java's popular let's call it ours javascript
i'm lost she can't be lost we're not we're not here to do anything today
we're here just to be sponges right all this stuff we're going to go in deeper
what is typescript you can think of like typescript as javascript
on the right way with extra bits and bobs that make it a

02:44
little bit easier to be maintainable and and write cleaner minute left folks
we learn opp yeah we'll learn oop object oriented programming
should we learn typescript along javascript hell no
learn javascript and then if you want to pick up typescript you can
30 seconds folks i prefer functional or oop i think my
brain just works better in oop i write a lot of functional code but i
think my brain just thinks better object-oriented i got my headphones in

02:45
alright folks come on back come on back let's do this thing
we'll go over the homework and we'll do a raid
come on back come on back let's do this thing all right chill the music here
all right so we already have it set up with our smurf
all right we already have our smurfs set up
we have the ability to pull the value out of the input
right then we just need our conditional logic so let's just go ahead and put the
conditional that we've seen already we saw with the with the domino's example
we saw an if and else if right and then an else so let's just use

02:46
that for here now we're going to check at first to see if day equals what
a equals what thank you sonia if day equals
what okay i'm gonna see if day equals tuesday
or and how do i say or how do i say or yeah there we go double pipe character or
day equals thursday cool uh and if it's day equals tuesday or
thursday we could put it into the dom like there's a way to put it into the
dom i'm going to let you figure out how to put it in the doll i'm just going to
use an alert for now i want you as part of your homework to like put it into the
dom so the user can see it so i'm gonna say class day
right right i'm gonna say class day is an alert alert will just be like a pop-up
right i want you to put it into the into the dom
all right so if it's not tuesday or thursday what's the next thing we want

02:47
to check what's the next thing we want to check
hey one check for the weekend so we'll say day equals saturday or
day equals sunday cool and if it is we'll just gonna alert weekend right
and if it's not tuesday thursday saturday or sunday what do we want to alert
exactly boring there we go cool all right let's save this and see
if we got anything working here all right let's refresh let's type in tuesday

02:48
and click check boom we got class day nice let's try saturday
boom we got the weekend and let's try monday
all right beautiful we got boring in the pop-up cool so it's working
hopefully there's like one problem that you're probably gonna run into with
the way we have this coded right now yeah the case sensitive exactly right
case sensitive exactly so if we were to come back and we already do this
we get boring what it says tuesday but we get boring right
we still get boring when we type in tuesday with a lowercase t because we

02:49
look at our code it's saying this day equal t cap capitalize t right
and so we have to make sure that our our day value right our day value
matches exactly the string or it won't be a match it is case sensitive so
part of your homework is to figure out how to make sure that
this is not case sensitive right so part of your homework is to make sure that
you can make this not be case sensitive arya dnv a thank you for the hydration
cheers to you so due tuesday a class day
i want you to have this working where it will work with lowercase capitalized
right uh so it doesn't matter the cases don't matter and
i want you to show it in the dom like i want to see the result on the page right
if we look there is a place for you to put

02:50
if it's class day weekend or boring day i want you to put it in there so that's
part of the homework make sure that it works
with all the casing and then make sure you put it in the in the actual dom cool
all right we are going to save the angry parent simulator and our
temperature converter until next class we'll save those for next class and
let's talk about the homework so next class we're going to go deeper into
javascript right we're going to go deeper into javascript
what i need you to do as part of your homework is plan out your networking for
next week right what events are you going to
what conferences are you going to how are you going to meet
two people already in tech that are not friends and family right remember this
one this week is supposed to be one next week's supposed to be two so don't wait

02:51
until next week to plan out your week in terms of networking make sure you plan
out your networking now right next uh you have two different
things i want you to read i want you to read the javascript.info variables and
at the end there are tasks right i want you to set up
i want you to do the tasks that are at the end of each of those at the end of
the variable section and i need you to read the function basics i need to do
the task at the end as well right this is all due tuesday all right i'll do
tuesday plan out your networking do these two bits of reading do the tasks
that come along with the reading and then
i want you to go back through all three of the projects that we've done so far
so you're going to go back to the youtube picker you're going to go back
to the not so great calculator and you're going to go back to the what day it is
i want you to add something to each of them right i want you to add

02:52
i want you to add uh something to each of them
all right i want you to add something to each of them
all right i want you to for the youtube background picker i want you to
right i want you to add a different color for the or the not so great calculator
right but not so great calculator i want you to add another
like value there i want you to add like another button like a minus five right
what day is today i want you to make sure that it works with any casing and i
want you to put the result in the dom right so you got a lot of stuff that i
want you to add to change to manipulate but
i want you once you once you've figured all those things out i want you to
delete all the javascript and do it again for each assignment
and then i want you once you get it done delete it again and do it and do it and

02:53
so you don't need to peek at the examples all right so the point here is to get
that repetition until you don't need to look at the example and once you no
longer need to look at those examples you will now have a base of syntax
that's going to carry you into the next couple of weeks that's already in your
brain cool and then the last thing i want you to do
is something nice for yourself this weekend right so whatever you want to do
for yourself this weekend do something nice for yourself you deserve it you've
been working hard we're getting into something that's gonna be a little bit
difficult don't forget the third thing we manage our frustration we're
consistent and we take care of ourselves do something special for yourself this
week i'm gonna ask on tuesday what you did so you better have done something
nice all right that's all i want to cover tonight
hopefully you had some fun uh getting into the basics of javascript
let's go ahead and do a raid and um after the raid
the weekend is yours have some fun i'm probably going to go live to test out

02:54
the sound stuff before sunday we have office hours on sunday so come through
we're going to look at some layouts we're going to have some fun we're gonna
answer some questions so i'll see you all on sunday and then the rest of y'all
see on tuesday so let's go and do a raid boom i'll see you over there
have some fun have a wonderful rest of your day a
wonderful weekend and it gets way more exciting from here folks this is just
the beginning of javascript can't wait to see you
in two to three months with all the skills that you have let's read
