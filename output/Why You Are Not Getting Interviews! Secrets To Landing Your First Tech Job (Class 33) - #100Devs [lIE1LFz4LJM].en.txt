00:00
yo hey good morning good afternoon good evening
i hope you all are doing well welcome back welcome back
oh tonight's a banger folks i don't know how else to explain it other than it is
a banger probably hands down the most important class that we'll have
yeah i'm gonna say it's probably the most important class that we have it's
time to start gearing up for the hunt to get into it to learn all the secrets
that i've learned over the past 10 years they're gonna help you get a job i'm
gonna try my best to condense them into tonight and into thursday's class

00:01
i'm glad you're here this is stuff this is stuff that's helped hundreds of
folks get jobs this is the stuff folks don't want you to know
it's focus we're gonna make some folks mad tonight
i'm gonna get some emails after tonight i'm gonna get a few calls
it's the secrets i'm spilling it all everything i got i'm putting into this so
tonight we got a lot of fun stuff to get into a lot of
wonderful tips and tricks for when it comes to how to interview
how to get a job how to do all these things they're gonna open up as many
doors as possible for you to get a wonderful job as a software engineer
no check-in tonight no check-in tonight if you
read the discord message i just asked you to follow
one of my dearest colleagues stephanie we call them the fairy job mother at rc

00:02
a lot of what i've learned about how to interview and the process of working
with so many hiring partners comes from what they what they've shared with me
what they've taught me and what i've seen them put into practice time and
time again so i just wanted to make sure that we
made that known that uh this this is uh somebody i think you should definitely
be following uh and it's definitely someone that has helped so many folks
get jobs and so instead of a check-in i said let's just follow them because i
know that it'll it'll it'll be a it'll be one of the better things you do
this week already cool we always like to start off with
some questions we also start off with some questions and so uh my question of
the day was how many applications how many applications have you submitted
over your years like job applications how many 600 or so what wow dozens 40 200

00:03
2 000 10 50 300 500-ish 3k 4k what wow all right folks whoo
we got we we we've done a lot of applying in the past but today
we learn a slightly different way this is wild a lot too many to count hundreds
i love it wow that's a lot folks nah i don't think so i i think this is i
think this is real for a lot of folks this is a lot that's a lot
all right shellcodes hey thank you for the raid hope you're doing well thanks
for coming through we're just getting started tonight or
we're running a class on how to get a job

00:04
dishing out all the secrets i've gotten over the past 10 years to help folks get
jobs hope you had a good stream hope you're up to some good stuff tonight
cool all right so we've had a lot of folks that have submitted a lot of
applications and uh unfortunately this is something i've
seen a lot with my students and it's something that i've seen uh with
folks that are trying to get jobs in tech
melody dev hey thank you for the get to subs thank you for being here hope
you're doing well i've seen a lot of folks go into this process without a plan
i've seen a lot of folks go into this process with some hopes and some dreams
i've seen some folks go into this process and they wander for months
with nothing happening you can't go into this practice you
can't go into the hunt you can't go into your interview season like an accident

00:05
no wandering no getting lost we're gonna have all the bangers the
tips the tricks the individual things they're gonna help you get a job and it
starts today it starts today meaning that we're gonna cover a lot of stuff
a lot of stuff that you're gonna have to start putting into practice
and this is the difference maker when it comes to getting a job
so many folks hyper focus on just the raw coding skills and i'm here to tell
you that's not it the things that we cover tonight
are going to be the things that actually help you secure a job
and this is not the ramblings of one person's perspective this is something

00:06
that i've learned that i've learned through my work at
resilient coders i work at general assembly across thousands of companies
thousands of companies we've talked to thousands of companies that we've worked
with hundreds of folks that have gotten jobs
so i'm gonna do my best to condense all that knowledge all that learning all the
things and people that we've talked to into this one class
now i haven't done it alone i have an amazing team at resilient coders that
has helped me do all these things for the past five plus years
stephanie who i just shared with you all here
has put a lot of this work in has worked tirelessly talking with hundreds of
companies figuring out what they want what they need and
understanding their process that's the key here
is that every company has a process of how you're going to move through the

00:07
interviews how you're going to pass what we're going to call the sniff test
and each company is different but they share a lot of similarities and so what
we're doing tonight is we're saying all right we know that we're going to apply
nay get referred to these companies and if we do all these things right
we stand a really good chance of getting through that interview process and
getting an offer so condensing what i've learned condensing what my colleague
stephanie has learned condensing uh what what lexi another person on my team
whose sole job is just to get hiring partners in the door they literally all
day long talking to companies talking to
hiring partners getting them in the door getting them to show up to talk to our
students at resilient coders all that knowledge condensed into this class and so
just want to put that out there right that this is this is this is not just my

00:08
well i guess this is what it's going no this is in the game on the block
figuring this all out over the past 10 years into this class so
we're gonna have to cover a lot it's a lot of stuff that we're gonna i'm
gonna start asking you to do but no this is the real work
and so i i have a i have a quote on the slides today normally it's rap lyrics
but i got a quote on the slides and it's one of the most
important quotes that i share with you i
share a lot of poetry with you i share a
lot of rap lyrics with you i share a lot
of motivational videos with you but this might be one of the most important ones
it comes from a dr eric thomas video that i've actually shared in the past
and uh they have a saying that's in this video
and they said all men are created equal some work harder in pre-season so i'm
going to change a little bit all people are created equal

00:09
some work harder in pre-season i can't tell you how many folks learn
how to code and then get mad when they don't get a job because they didn't put
in the work during the pre-season it's not about the code it's about the work
that you start doing tonight that lays the foundation that lays the springboard
that's going to enable you to jump into a job and if you do not do these things
that we cover tonight do not expect to get a job
i know it's a very bold statement but it's something i believe in my heart of
hearts you might get lucky great if you do
but tonight we're talking about opening as many doors as possible
so you can get those opportunities coming your way and lock down the job
all people are created equal some work harder in pre-season this is your
pre-season we got to put in the work and i've worked with a lot of different
folks i don't care if you don't have a degree

00:10
i don't care where you're coming from i don't care if you're a returning citizen
i do not care who you are i've worked with a lot of different people
and they've all been able to get jobs when they put in this work
some will listen to me tonight and you'll go on for the rest of your life
not doing the things that we talk about tonight
you'll see opportunity pass you by and i want you to remember
i want you to remember that i told you this if you do not do these things
your chances of getting a job become way more difficult it's a lot of hard work
we're about to sign up for but it makes it possible it makes it possible
triple action clear eyes hey thank you for the five get the subs thank you for

00:11
being here all right harder than js yes it's harder than js it's harder than oop
but it's not technical i don't care how good you are at javascript
i don't care how good you are at oop it doesn't matter when it
comes time to get a job it just doesn't is this work and it's it's not hard it's
a lot that's it that it's not hard it's a lot it's things that we have to do
every single day from now until we get the offer right
it's the stuff that we have to do every single day from now until we get the
offer that makes it so that we can get to the nerds and then
have our javascript and oop shine out but i don't care how good you were at
javascript i don't care how good you are at the front end i don't care how good
you're at oop it doesn't matter what matters about getting the job and

00:12
opening as many doors as possible is this stuff tonight rock man welcome
all right let's get into i set the stage let's get into it all right
so uh this friday just as a as a recap we have a car class coming up so uh
at the end of today's class we'll talk a
little bit about it and then on thursday
uh we will have everything that you need to know right so on on thursday
everything else will finish up so we're going to hint at a lot of stuff tonight
and then thursday we're going to reinforce it and we're going to see some
really important stuff we're going to talk about behavioral
questions tonight questions that you're going to get asked during interviews
questions that we are going to practice over and over until our lips are dry
right and the way that we do our behavioral
questions is with a method called car cause action result

00:13
and so on friday i'm gonna do some of these questions live just to see you can
get the idea just so you can get the idea of how you
might actually start answering these questions in an actual interview scenario
cool so is it like star yes but it's one thing
less you have to remember which makes it better so cars better than star
so we're gonna talk about that end of tonight but know that we have a class on
friday beautiful office hour sunday 1 p.m right office hours 1 p.m on sunday now
this sunday will be a big review will be a big review
uh it'll be kind of everything we've covered in javascript so that way we can

00:14
jump into the back end right everything that we've covered so far in javascript
and one sunday we're going through it all again however long it takes us we're
going to get through it uh so if you've been a little shaky on any of the
javascript stuff you're you're joining us a little bit later in the in the
program you're part of the ketchup crew and you want to review some javascript
that's going to be this sunday so car friday
office hours full super review on sunday and uh remember you got a fresh start
don't care if you submitted homework in the past don't care if you forgot a few
a few check-ins don't care the sleigh's been wiped clean you start fresh today
and part of that starting fresh is that your networking starts again
today this week i need you to have at least one
coffee chat that's the goal for this week we're going to bring the networking
back in bring the networking back in get get up to speed a little bit

00:15
right getting back up to speed and so one coffee chat this week
julia had two today nice seems like we had a lot of new folks
today um yes things are recorded um the vods are available on twitch afterwards
and they eventually get up on youtube but there's a lot of perks to being live
and then most of our like car classes and stuff like that will be on discord
because we're sharing a lot of personal stuff so make sure in the discord
exclamation point discord uh every single time we go live we put a message
in discord so you never miss anything cool alrighty so networking starts again
today client deadline is pushed to may 17th so you can get a paid client you can

00:16
volunteer for a grassroots organization or you can contribute free software
g weenie hey thank you for the five get themselves appreciate you thank you for
being here and quantum hey thank you for the tier three appreciate you cool
alrighty now two really important bits of information
just want to bring back to the top of your mind things that we need to start
incorporating because you should be still doing your anchor remember when we
go through the material especially the material tonight active recall
and space repetition are your friends when you're done with a class or you're
done with reading make sure you're actively recalling all the things that
you just learned we know the science behind active recall make sure you're
still using it to this day make sure you're still putting into action when

00:17
we're done with a raid make sure you ask yourself wait what did i learn tonight
talk it out loud say it out loud grab grab a duck do something that you can
actively recall the things that you learn and don't forget that you're going to
have to constantly be resetting your forgetting curve we know that we can
reset our forgetting curve using a tool like anki and if we constantly reset our
forgetting curve we won't forget stuff software engineering is a cumulative
career you're gonna need to know this stuff for the rest of your life and so
don't slouch on your anki anki's gonna become a crucial
crucial tool over the next three months that you can
learn something that we're gonna talk about tonight called the bank
so please if you've been slouching on your active recall and your space
repetition this is your wake-up call to bring it back into your life

00:18
we know the science behind space repetition we know why we do it the idea
that we can do something that could increase our retention
increase our ability to recall stuff is super important
async awaits hey thank you for the five gifted subs thank you for being here
chart thank you for the hydration cheers to you or cart sorry thank you for the
hydration cheers to you all right now dennis thank you for the posture check
y'all splashing out with the channel points today eh
let me get the posture right cool now the reason why i'm bringing this up and
why this space repetition is so important is because as we go in to the hunt
as we actually start interviewing well guess what you have to be able to recall
all the knowledge that we've learned throughout the program
and so if you have not been doing your space repetition it's going to be harder

00:19
to recall that information during the hunt and so please
bring anki back into the game it's going
to make you more calm it's going to make
you more confident it's going to make it easier when you're in these interviews
for things to flow like butter and for them to not have any doubt and have you
passed that sniff test cool alrighty now a lot of folks think
that getting the job comes down to your coding ability and you hear me say over
and over again that that's not the case but over my 10 years
over the thousands of people i've seen learn how to code and over the hundreds

00:20
of folks that have gotten great jobs as software engineers that i've had a part
in and not like not like oh i talked to them once like no like they were in my
classroom and i helped them get a job there was only one thing
that i have ever seen that has been the indicator as to
whether or not someone is going to get a job it's only one thing
and that one thing is that they made a decision that this is what they want
that's it they woke up and they said i'm gonna get a job as a software engineer
now the problem is a lot of folks say they want it but they kind of want it
they don't they they want it but they they just kind of want it they they want

00:21
this they want the salary they want the slides in the office they
they want the happy career but they're not at the point where
they're ready to put in the work to get it
and so i have a lot of folks that tell me hey leon i want a job as a software
engineer and that's great but i can tell that they just kind of want it and then
there's always a moment in a lot of my students and the favorite thing for me
ever when i was in the classroom is one day i would come into the classroom
and the person that was in the back is now on the front
and it's something i i i i can't shake and i know how to explain i don't know
how to like bottle it up i just can just tell you what i see
that person is now in the front and i can see it in their eyes

00:22
something's different a a a a switch has flipped something's different
they're going to do the things that it takes to get the job
it's not about their coding ability it's not about how good javascript it's a
it's a relentlessness it's a resilience it's a determination
that says i'm gonna do what it takes to get the job because getting the job is a
hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] task and some folks wake up the switch is
flipped and they're ready to put in the work the hunger exactly the grit
that it's gonna take to get the job is there
and it's okay if you can't get there but i'm telling you that's the only thing
that ever matters right it's the only thing that i have ever seen across

00:23
hundreds of students it's just that that that that look
i don't know how to explain it it's just the look that i see it's it's
someone that says you know what i'm going to do what it takes
and i'm not going to stop it it's a decision it really is just a decision
and so i don't need you to make that decision tonight
but i need you to make it soon do you want this do you want a job as a
software engineer do you want a job that
has a good stable career that has a high growth ceiling that is legitimately one
of the happiest careers for the past five years running or do you kind of
want it because if you kind of want it these next few months are gonna be
really rough but if you want it and you're not gonna take no for an

00:24
answer you're willing to sign up to the rejection you're willing to to have 59
interviews go horribly wrong just to have the last one go right
then you're in the right spot but it's a decision that you have to make
and a lot of folks that that tell me right off the gate lee i'm going to do
it i want it no seriously sit on this question
like think about it put your mind to it is it something that you really want
is it something that you're willing to continue in this trough of sorrow for
all right because if you kind of want it this is not for you
kind of want it is just going to cause you some pain and suffering
kind of want it is going to be a waste the next few months
kind of want it is you're going to be mad that in three months that like

00:25
you've learned all this code but you're not closer to getting a job like just
make the decision and if you want it and you know that you want it and you've
made that switch the next few months there's a lot we to do
right a lot that we got to do and so tonight is about presenting those things
to you so that when you make the decision you have this class to come back to
you have all of these things right you have all of these things that you
can rely on that you know are gonna open up doors
to get you closer to that job but this is not a class four and this is the rest
of program's not for folks that kind of want it and i i don't mean that in some
like weird hustle culture [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's just something that i've seen
time and time again there are some folks at this point in the process

00:26
that kind of want it and they're going to float for the next portion of program
they're going to float through the job hunt it's not going to work out and then
they're going to disappear and be upset at themselves no
make a decision do you want it or do you kind of one because if you want it
there's a lot of stuff you have to start doing every day for the next three
months to make it happen and it's okay it's okay if you just kind
of want it and this was a good experience and you're ready to dip fine
i'll take it i it doesn't it's a decision it doesn't
matter how good of an interviewer you are it doesn't matter how good of a
coder you are it's just a decision are you going to stick it out you're
going to go through the trophy star you're going to do all the things that
suck because the next three months suck they're not fun
i'm going to try and make it as fun as possible but they're but they're

00:27
not and so i i just want to put that out there save yourself some pain cool
axel it doesn't it matter good for web dev it also works
good for general software development web dev just has a lot of jobs right now
cool all right i said to put that out there i
have to put it out there i know that it's a doom gloom thing to say but
there's really no difference i've worked with so many different students
i've worked with so many different students from all different walks of
life that have had lots of privilege no privilege that i've had
tons of experience no experience and it doesn't matter when it comes to this
next three months these three months these three next
months it just doesn't matter it's a decision that you make that you're gonna
put in the work to get this stuff done and if you do you open enough doors to

00:28
get a job that's it that's all it is cool all right now i am based in the us
and a lot of my getting a job experience comes from working with folks that are
based in the u.s now over the last year i have been blessed
to work with a lot of folks specifically through 100 devs that are from all over
the world in fact our first 10 or so jobs most of them were for folks not in
the us i've worked really hard to understand the remote perspective and
i've worked really hard to understand folks that are applying in different
countries i've done a lot of different weird things i've gone through visa
processes i've helped people get sponsored visas i've done a lot of
things but at the end of the day most of my experience comes from the u.s and i
think it's worthwhile to name that because there might be things little
little quirks that are different to your
specific country or your specific region that might not perfectly align with the
things that cover tonight that's okay you can figure out those quirks and

00:29
features of your area but no i'm gonna take the perspective
tonight that you are applying to a local area and
then we'll also take the perspective that you might be applying to remote
companies tonight will be a little bit more geared towards folks that are
applying to local companies and then we'll have more and more stuff that
covers about remote possibilities as well alrighty now
here's another big thing tonight's a lot of caveats before we jump into i told
you these are all my secrets i'm spilling everything so i got to put some

00:30
caveats on the class um what we're about to cover tonight
uh is is a lot of stuff that are probably moral decisions
like these some of the things i want to share tonight are legitimately moral
decisions i am a if you haven't realized by now a
by any means necessary type of person i don't care about companies i care
about y'all i'm going to show you how to play a game
it's going to be up to you if you want to play it okay i get a lot of hate
a lot of weird stuff from these these classes
um a lot of folks don't like the things i'm gonna share tonight that's okay i
really don't care i felt a lot of folks get jobs and at

00:31
the end of the day i don't care about some corporation and i don't care
about your company i i don't care about your culture
i don't care about anything about your organization
because i saw what happened during the pandemic
i saw the companies that were were a family
that took care of their that took care of their employees day in and day out
that had all the fancy stuff and as soon as the pandemic hit new phone who this
i don't even know who you are what do you want to get paid no
so quickly some of the best companies turned on their employees and it got
dirty real quick so it's not personal it's business
i don't care about your org i don't care about your company i care about the
people that i'm trying to help get jobs and so
if your process is broken enough that i can game it well guess what i'm going to

00:32
game it because i want my students the folks that i work with
to to have as many opportunities as possible now
i put my cards on the table it's up to you if you want to play that game or not
and at the end of the day i really do hope that you keep in mind
that it really isn't personal that it's all business and that these companies
don't care about you i don't care if they say they care about you i don't
care if they promise that they care about you when the chips are down and
they could save a dollar by following you guess what's going to happen you're
going to get fired and so i'm here to play a game that is
going to help me get the most opportunity and i don't have any love
for these companies cool so we got a lot of things on the table here

00:33
we know that we're signing up for a a really hard process
a process where you have to make a decision
that says you know what i'm willing to put in the work
i'm willing to to to go through this struggle so that i can one day wake up
to a good job a good paycheck to good health insurance to a happy career
to where a lot of your life could fundamentally change
it comes down to a decision it comes down to playing
some things in a very specific order to doing a few things right if you do all
these things you can wind up with a great job
corey hey thank you for the gift it subs thank you for being here cool
so i put that on the table i really do hope that you

00:34
take everything to heart tonight that you make the decision
um that you understand that the things we're covering tonight people don't like
me to share they don't they really don't like when i
share some of these things some of these things are are the opposite of what a
lot of other folks will tell you to do you're gonna you're gonna have some some
some of your software engineering friends they're going to be mad i know
i'm getting some emails but you don't have to email me i you already know i'm
you're not getting a reply from me we're going to make some nerds angry
but at the end of the day you have a lot of tools a lot of systems
that are going to support you over the next three months they're gonna make it
easier for you to get a job all right so tonight we're gonna have kind of six
main pieces we're gonna have a crafting your story
which we've kind of already talked a little bit about we had our first
crafting story we're to talk about your online presence we're going to talk
about the most important thing that you will ever do
when it comes time to getting a job and that's your hit list

00:35
we're going to talk about the interview process and what you can expect and then
we're going to get into car and prep two systems they're going to make it easier
right they're going to make it easier for you
to get through these interviews and we're going to talk about the actual
interviewing process there's a lot of stuff to get through tonight there's a
lot of meat here um but let's dive right into it malik hey
flex 14. thank you for the 10 give themselves that's wild thank you so much
thank you for being here that's wild thank you so much
the the subs have been wild tonight thank you everybody for the gifted subs
the subs the uh the prime subs and all of jeff bezos's money i appreciate it
thank you for being here all right before we jump into it two things that i
would appreciate if you did right away uh first thing is grab the checklist if

00:36
you click the link here in the slides you can always do exclamation point
slides if you need the slides all right in the slides boom you can grab you can
do actually point slides to get the slides they're also in the discord message i
didn't send them at the first the first time we got pushed you could check the
discord get the link there uh you can always actually slide to get them i can
always do i think it's exclamation point checklist for the checklist as well i
think that works as well and uh make sure you have this checklist
it's the professional checklist that we've been using it's been part of your
homework but we're going to use it a lot tonight
a lot of what comes from this checklist is the hard work of my colleague at rc
stephanie uh so if you haven't already i
really appreciate you just giving them a
follow in fact i'll give you a second to give them a follow on twitter um i've
learned a lot from working with them uh they they've helped so many of the
students that i work with get jobs it's just really worthwhile to just give them
a quick follow just as a thank you for putting together this checklist putting

00:37
into a lot of stuff we're going to cover tonight i'll drop their lincoln chat
cool alrighty boom we got the checklist because we're
using it a lot tonight just have it pulled up so you can reference it as i
start talking through it i'm actually going to read through some of quite a
few of the things that are in the checklist so it's good to have it open
for uh tonight all right first and most important thing
that you need is we start gearing up for the hunt is this idea of crafting your
story so we had our one class on crafting your story
but the crafting your story is all about one really important thing
why are you here and when i say why are you here i mean it's it's more about

00:38
like why are you the best person for this job and why are you applying
for this software engineering position right it's it's thinking about all your
highlights thinking about yourself in the most positive light possible
we heard in the first crafting your story classes folks with a range of
different experiences i only chose the best things from those experiences and
we found a way to make it seem like a highlights reel of their life and that
is why you are here right and so what is
the reason like why do we invest so much time in crafting your story
well it's because you all smell oh it's bad you all smell right no smell
you have a boot camp smell it's okay but you all have a smell

00:39
and it's it's not like a physical smell uh it's a smell that when you are
trying to go through the interview process it's something that's gonna stop you
from getting to the nerds okay we all have a smell that's gonna
stop us from getting to the nerds a lot of times before we can actually
interview at a company there's a recruiter or someone standing in our way
and they actually don't spend a lot of time with each candidate they take a
quick look a quick breeze a quick sniff right a quick sniff
and if you smell they don't let you continue on in the process
and a lot of folks this is where their journey ends they never
ever passed the sniff test i can't tell you how many folks i've

00:40
worked with one-on-one that were flandering trying to get jobs
and they just didn't pass a basic sniff test
they didn't look like they didn't sound like they didn't smell like an engineer
and when someone is only spending six seconds looking at your resume
taking a quick peek at your linkedin and github if all your ducks are in a row
you're not going to pass the sniff test and you're not going to make it to the
next round of the interviews and so a lot of what we do in the beginning
right we do a lot in the beginning is setting ourselves up so that we don't
smell and we all come to this process with a lot of things
that just when you start to think about it are some of the worst things you

00:41
could ever do one of the worst things i see that gets my goat where i get so mad
is folks that have junior or aspiring all over their socials
on their twitter on their linkedin it says junior engineer or aspiring
software engineer no one wants to hire an aspiring
software engineer if you still have junior you still have aspiring get it
off your profiles right now please delete it get rid of it it's out of here
that's the smell i'm talking about that's the smell
we all come into this process all right we all come into this process
doing things that make us stink and so tonight is about identifying those things

00:42
removing them from our life so that we can get past this initial sniff now
once you get past this initial sniff you can make it to the nerds
right you can make it the nerd and once you get to the nerds
the folks that are actually on the engineering teams well then it comes
down to two things it comes down to can you code
and do i want to work with you for the next two years and i've seen students
game one of these really really well and get a job right
but if you can pass that first sniff test you can get to the actual engineers
where you're doing actual engineering interviews it really comes down to two
things can you code and do i want to work with you for the
next two years both of these there is a game to be played can you code well we

00:43
can do a lot of stuff that tips it in our favor there's a
reason why there's so many things that we do at 100 devs can you code well yes
talk to my previous clients boom you now
know i know how to code can you code yes look at my 100 hours project
it's a project i sunk 100 hours into oh you do know how to code
can you code yes look at all the projects i built as part of my teams at
100 devs can you code yes look at my github profile look at all my
green squares i code every day i push code every day can you code yes
look at me solve these coding challenges because i've been doing a cold wars
every day for the past six months so the can you code question we got that
on lock and we're going to continue to have this on lock there's a reason

00:44
why we do the things that we do because it all is leading up to this process
where we have to pass this initial sniff and we're going to talk about how to do
that tonight and then once we make it to the actual engineers there's two
questions we have to pass and the can you code if you just do the things that
i'm asking you're going to be able to say yes to all those can you code
questions and you're going to have proof that shows that you can code real
clients real projects real github history that when they have to ask
they're doing a little sniff of their own they go oh yeah this person knows
how to code and then we're going to talk a lot about
this and do i want to work with you for the next two years like i said there's a
game to be played it's up to you if you want to play it
we're going to talk about a hit list we're going to talk about getting to
know folks that are at the companies where we are getting referred into
and uh when i show up to that interview you know when i show up to that

00:45
interview i know who i'm talking to i scoped them out on twitter
i looked at all their tweets i read their blog i saw in 19
i saw in 2019 that they went to a magic the gathering convention or a tournament
and uh when i sit down to that interview and i have my notebook with me as my
notebook hits the table oops my magic the gathering card falls out of my book
and i go oh sorry i gotta grab that card
and put it back into my notebook here it was an accident
right and now they see oh you play magic
oh yeah i love playing magic together we play magic gathering since i was little
this is just one of my favorite cards here by the way
put it back into my notebook i'm here to interview how are you today
they got got so now not only will they know that you know how to code
but this person is going to want to work with you for the next two years they

00:46
want to play some matches gathering over lunch so like i said
there's some games to be played i'm going to show you how to play them it's
up to you if you want to play them this way so tonight we're going to talk a lot
about passing the can you code sniff test we're going to talk about this
other part i want to work with the next two years
because that's just equally as important i've had some students
that didn't do too hot with the code part
but they played the social game and they still got the offer
so different things for different folks here
all the fun stuff we're going to get into all right so now
when you're trying to get past this sniff test
you all are labeled right now with a boot camper smell
and when you are labeled with that boot camper smell
one of the very first things you can do to get past that smell is to have a well

00:47
crafted story does that does not mention anything about a boot camp
i know it sounds really kind of wild but that's it
uh somebody said a mod mail the other day uh i forget what it was about
they were talking about something about an applying somewhere and one of our
mods occ jennifer they said i applied to 20 companies and never once
did it come up that i was in a boot camp i applied to 20 companies before they
got their job and never once did i utter the word boot camp right
your story is so much more than a boot camp you have so many more things you can
mention that you could bring up that are highlights to your life that lead into
why you're showing up for that job today and that boot camp has nothing to do
with it self taught has nothing to do with it none of these words are things

00:48
that help you pass the sniff test nobody
wants to hire a boot camper nobody wants to hire a self-taught engineer we don't
have to snitch on ourselves out the gate we don't have to shoot ourselves in the
foot when this gatekeeper with their magical
list of gatekeeping [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doesn't care they just don't care now
we're going to present our story in the best possible light we're going to
our our truth in the most possible best possible light
and if they want to dig we let them dig we let them dig it's okay
to let them dig but what i'm saying is that coming out the gate

00:49
you don't have to snitch on yourself let them dig right let them dig
exactly jesus let them dig don't dig yourself in a hole exactly let them dig
if they want to dig but you don't need to come out the gate
saying oh well i just started coding three months ago i did a boot camp and i
have some projects you want to see my projects no stop it nobody cares
you got six seconds to impress them they don't need to hear that you just
started or whatever no talk about your wins highlight your experiences and talk
about how they lead to where you are today i don't care what your background is
there is a way to craft your story and the crafting story classes that
we're doing are going to help you recognize that and i'm gonna share a

00:50
link after class on discord we recorded a session with alumni uh helping them
craft their story and so i'll share that
as well so you can see more examples but talk about your wins
let's say you were a server in a restaurant for 10 years
you can craft a story beautifully for 10 years i worked in the services industry
working with a wide range of different tools and technologies
at my previous employer i had to use a pos system that was
piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and uh i realized that i probably could
write better software and so i took it upon myself to learn javascript and
while i was working that industry i was also writing code to make the industry
better the pandemic hit as you know the service

00:51
industry was devastated so i leaned into my engineering skill set i leaned into
freelancing and working with several wonderful clients but i'm tired
of the agency life i'm tired of working with clients and always having to chase
the next meal so i'm ready to join a product team such as yours that builds
software that people love because my roots is working with
software that i hate it and so i'm really excited to be interviewing with
your company today boom that's it that's someone's story that has been a
waiter or waitress for the past 10 years at no point did i say i did a boot camp
at no point did i snitch on myself at no point did i not talk about myself
in the best light possible there is always a way so i've asked you to do it

00:52
and we're going to take some time to do it tonight as well
so we are going to take five minutes to craft our stories five minutes
to craft our stories i want you to think about your previous experience in the
best light possible just the winds easy transitions are
this is what i was doing i didn't like doing it here's how i tried to fix it
started freelancing and now i'm trying to join your company
so i want you to take five minutes to think through your story all right
think through your story to write out your highlights
and don't you dare mention a bootcamp you don't even need 100 devs in that
story at all you can say 100 devs was an agency where you got your first clients
if you got a paid client boom but you don't need it to be there

00:53
all right let's go ahead five minutes on the clock if you finish your story
i want you to put it in chat you don't you don't type in a chat type
it to yourself but i want you to put it in chat okay take five minutes
five minutes to craft your story in the best light possible
i'll put some musics on we're gonna come back
hey thank you for the raid thank you for bringing the crew back
i appreciate it thank you for coming through uh we are talking about how to
get a job tonight talk about how to get a job in tech
condensing 10 years of helping folks get jobs as software engineers into two
classes and this is the first one and now right now we're talking about
crafting our story uh when you craft a story it's the reason why you're showing

00:54
up for the job tonight because most folks specifically folks that are
getting their first job in tech have a smell
they smell like we can smell the boot camp on them
and we're trying to think about just our highlights our our our positives the
things that are explaining why we're showing up for the job because if you
can craft that story you can get past that initial gatekeeper you can get to
the engineers and then once you get to the engineers it's kenny code you don't
want to work with work with you for the next two years so we're taking a few
minutes just to craft our story you see some folks throwing their stories into
chat if you finish early and you feel comfortable throw your story in chat so
other folks can get some inspiration from it five minutes is way too short nah
three sentences if that's all you got three sentences don't don't you don't
have to you don't have to give me the whole story

00:55
no need for loquaciousness tonight give me the bangers only
all right come on through folks three minutes think through it you got this
country puzzle hey thank you for the raid i appreciate you always bringing
the crew by hope you had a good stream hope you're
doing well thank you everybody for stopping by [Music]
look at these stories folks they're good see some of you all snitching on

00:56
yourself and your stories you don't have to say you were fired not to say you
were let go just say you transitioned so many good ones folks well done

00:57
everybody peace beautiful minute left 15. [Music]
my speech is as a follower of ganchi i can with everything [Music]
how would you word being a stay-at-home mom we actually did that in our crafting
or story class there's a lot of things that you run
into as a stay-at-home mom that can be challenges
and say you were working on those challenges decided to write software to
help with those challenges you started freelancing and now you're

00:58
looking for a job on a product team alrighty folks
welcome back come on back let's take a let's take a look at this
a lot of folks a lot of good a lot of good ones here i love seeing them all
is there a limit for the blurb you want it you want to keep it like three to
five sentences i think three sentences is where you start then you add another
two of like the filler and you're in a good spot right
um something i noticed as i was reading a lot of these is a lot of you are still
snitching on yourselves right like we understand like a lot of us are here
like like a lot of us are here because food tastes good and jobs give us money

00:59
to buy food and like that's why we're here we can't say that in an interview
but i mean realistically that's why we're here food is helpful right like
that's why i'm an engineer like literally why i'm an engineer because i
needed food and so i built a website got money and then was able to eat food
right but we can't say that in an interview
so the the idea of like saying like i'm here because of money like that's why
we're all there probably a big portion of us um but we
can't put that in our in our stories uh because we're playing the game right
i'm also seeing a lot of you that are still kind of snitching on yourself a
little bit i said it kind of while you were working but um there's no need to
say i was let go that i was laid off that i was fired it's always that you
were transitioning and really as long as you're identifying something
that was wrong that you or didn't like and you built solutions to fix it and
you started freelancing and now you're looking for a role in a product team
that can be your story for most of these but these look amazing so far it's a

01:00
good start keep working on this keep practicing we're gonna have nights where
we're gonna craft stories live we're gonna have places to workshop them with
others so this is a good start i'm glad we're thinking about this our mind's in
the right spot we're at the top of the hour so we're to take our break
when we come back from the break we're going to keep pushing a lot of stuff to
get to tonight all right should our blurb be what we strive to
provide what we currently provide that's up to you how you want to stretch
that word what you strive could also be what you currently provide if you
if you if you word it correctly cool alrighty folks
let's go and put our timer up here for our break five minutes on the clock if
you're able please get up move around hydrate look out the window if you have
one to see something that's not your screen let your eyes focus on something
that's in the distance and we'll be back in five minutes to keep pushing i

01:01
the best is yet to come folks this is just this is just a taste we got a lot

01:06
of stuff to get into tonight all right five minutes on the clock in five [Music]
hey liam can you help the craftsman store i'm an engineering student
uh students are easy right you just talk about your your projects right
especially if you're coming right out of university i was in university i built
some amazing stuff worked some amazing companies and internships and boom
alrighty folks come on back come on back
all right i know the folks kind of get a little a little nervous about the

01:07
crafting your story that's okay we're gonna have lots of classes on crafting
your story remember uh this is this is the start right this is the beginning
this is us gearing up for the hunt uh a lot of this stuff we're gonna go deeper
on but tonight's a lot of things i need you thinking about the things i need you
to start putting these gears into motion and so we're going to have full classes
on kind of more crafting the story kind of more of those like friday sessions
where we spend time doing it so this won't be our first and last time talking
about it hey kirko all right and then we'll actually have a whole
like class night where we're on remote on discord helping each other with this
stuff so like i said these are first passes we have nights where we work
together to get these things done where we can come together as a community to
help folks that are not feeling too great about how they're crafting their
story but you got to start getting the wheels turning remember it's a decision

01:08
you want it or do you not that's it make the decision cool all right
next we got to talk about our online persona remember if we're going to pass
this sniff test a lot of passing that sniff test
is what you put out there publicly for these interviewers these recruiters to
see and so this online persona begins with kind of three key things and
some of these things we've already talked about but we're going to bring
them up again your portfolio your twitter and your linkedin so
uh is an amazing resource it is one of the best tools that you will have
when it comes time to getting a job and so i'm going to jump ahead a little

01:09
bit here to explain why when you are trying to get a job we do not apply
i said one more time let me get big here for a second when it comes time
to get a job we never click apply we will get referred into these jobs
here's what happens at most tech companies at most tech companies
engineers get referral bonuses so if they refer another engineer
they get a check i've seen the checks anywhere from like 2k to 30 grand
per referral right and so if you cannot get referred you don't stand a chance

01:10
right so many companies have referral fees and if you can't get a referral
and the engineers are getting five ten grand for each referral it's a
wrap you might as well just go home also when you just click apply and you don't
get referred it is the equivalent of printing out your resume
crumpling it up and throwing it in the trash can every time you click apply
just imagine somewhere there's a printer that prints out your resume crumples it
up and throws it in the trash can if you can't get referred you are going
up against folks that are getting referred because so many of these
companies have referral fees and if somebody's getting referred that
means that there's someone that's vouching for them and that's why the
referral is so important with the referral
it will help you typically skip one of the first rounds of the interview which

01:11
we'll talk about in a bit but it is something that immediately
immediately helps you get past the sniff test somebody on the team right
someone that was on the team said that you should be on the team right
someone on the team said that you should be on the team
that carries more weight than anything that you could do it carries more weight
than your your github it carries more weight than your portfolio carries more
weight than your linkedin carries more weight than your coding ability when
someone on the team says that this person should be on the team too right
so if you're not getting a referral and you're going up against other folks
that already have the referral your resume is getting crumpled up and
thrown in the trash can right in fact you printing out your

01:12
resume crumpling up and throwing it in the trash can probably has a better
probability of you getting a job than clicking apply because
when you take out the trash and you throw it into the into like the the
larger garbage can a raccoon is going to come along at night
dig through the trash pull out your resume run into the street with the
resume get hit by a car the person gets out the car oh my god i
just hit this raccoon and notices in the raccoon's mouth that there's a piece of
paper and that piece of paper has your name on it it is your
resume and this this hiring manager is so overwhelmed with
grief from having run over the raccoon that they decide that they have to give
you an interview and you do well in the interview because you have an amazing
portfolio amazing github amazing projects you've been doing code wars

01:13
every day for the past four months so you get the job
that was way more likely than you clicking apply and getting a job
okay just so that we understand that and so in a world
where referrals are so important twitter can be a really good tool
because when you have a well manicured twitter
which we'll talk about in a second there's something that you can do a
cheat code one of the biggest cheat codes i got right
to get referrals we have to know someone and to get to know someone we
have to turn them from an acquaintance into our friend
well if you have a good twitter where you set it up right where you set it up
so that you come across as another fellow engineer
hello fellow engineers i love nia's twitter they talk about themselves in
the best positive light right hey dies in chat there we go

01:14
nye is original twitter your inclusive tech leader founder cto
afros and ai software engineer is it does it say does it say anything other
than i am a badass software engineer no that's it it's all it is
their newer one software engineer abolitionist community builder right
talking their talk about who they are this is a phenomenal twitter
i believe we also have sam in chat as well do exclamation point sam if you
want to learn more about sam talks about who they are developer
advocate they're a developer 100 devs a lot like they're talking their talk in
their lovely twitter profiles all right hey sam is here what's going on sam uh
and so you build a good twitter profile that where you come across as the
software engineer that you are and then follow 50 engineers
where you will be applying so if you are in boston follow 50 engineers in boston

01:15
if you are in austin texas follow 50 engineers in austin texas it might take
you a while to find those engineers but you're going to find them
if you know that you're going to be applying remote look for remote
developer hashtags and follow 50 engineers that are using those hashtags
put them in a twitter list and then every day just interact with their content
like it retweet it that's it i mean that's you don't go much further than that
like it retweet it do that every day for a month or two
if they don't have that many followers but there's a person that's constantly
liking engaging with their posts maybe you leave a
comment every once in a while oh you're talking about typescript i just
started learning typescript here's a tutorial i found that i really really like

01:16
right it's just simple engagement not anything hard you can just start by liking
right just by liking and retweeting and then as you get more comfortable
right as you start to get more comfortable and you see little places to
interject boom you're not worried about everything on twitter
you're talking about the 50 engineers that you found that are in your area
that you've added to a private list so when you go on twitter you're not
looking at all the crap on twitter you're just looking at your list of 50
engineers right 50 engineers and you're focused on
engaging with them liking their content leaving little comments and guess what
you do that for a month you're now acquaintances they know you
they only got 300 followers and so if you're liking everything engaging with
them you you just you just made a friend boom boom cheat code right

01:17
and then when it comes time to get a job and you need a referral the person that
you just been casually talking to on twitter hey
i've been following your content for a really long time
i i love the things that you've been sharing
would you be pop would you be willing to give me a coffee chat
just 10 15 minutes of your time so i can hear about how you got to where you are
or how you like working at such and such a company right little little
little little things right and i know a lot of folks get
really uncomfortable with the the networking but this is easy
this is just liking and retweeting until you get comfortable and then once you
get comfortable you can start engaging a little bit more all right
do you have any tips on how to find them just go on twitter
you got to be willing to put in the work right gotta be willing to put in the
work anyone can go on twitter start looking for engineers start looking for

01:18
folks that are using certain hashtags that are looking for certain cities
right you can go on angel list there are some other places to get it but it's
going to take you a little while to find them right
but you want to find engineers that are in the city right use city hashtags
use things that are relevant to that area look up specific companies that are in
that area right it's gonna take you a little while but you can find them
if you're in a bigger city probably has it's probably easier to like google it
it takes a little while put in that work and then do that engagement right
cool so twitter can be a phenomenal tool right phenomenal tool to build those
very simple relationships to to lay down that groundwork
right lay down that groundwork of you being perceived as a fellow engineer not
only are you engaging with other engineers but you could also

01:19
start sharing content that makes you look like an engineer right you could
every day tweet something technical you could literally read hacker news and
then tweet about something you read on hacker news that's it
or if you're someone that doesn't like social media
grab a free buffer account spend one day a month just
putting in tweets that are gonna be sent out automatically right
right put it into buffer buffer is an app that'll automatically tweet for you
right and then you don't have to worry about it maybe you put time into it once
a month it does its thing now you're looking like an engineer talking about
the engineering topics you're engaging with other engineers you're building
some acquaintances with engineers in your city boom
something slightly small that you're doing every day to build those

01:20
relationships what did you tweet about every day oh oh
that's that's a little too much for me mind blown yeah it's not it's not
it's not wild but small list focus on engaging
it's going to help you pass a sniff test and it's going to build some simple
relationships for you when it comes time to referrals cool
all right linkedin and angellist you want to make sure that you're
setting up your linkedin and angel lists correctly um when it comes to the
linkedin and angel list if you read the professional checklist there's a lot of

01:21
things on this checklist that are going to help you with this right um
some people are saying how long should the blurb be boom tells you how long it
should be uh when it comes time your portfolio we'll talk about a second
there it is um linkedin in angel list there's a few
things you want to start setting up these profiles if you don't have the
profile now you want to make sure that you are setting it up
now so they can marinate so by the time you're ready for a job these profiles
have been marinating for you right and so these profiles are going to help
recruiters find you help people that are trying to hire you find you and so
following this checklist for linkedin and angellist could be um
a really good thing to start immediately that's why i asked you to do as part of
the professional checklist so you'll notice one of the first things is
to get a professional headshot you don't need to pay for headshots right
go near an open window take a good selfie
right and then remove the background of your selfie i use remove bg

01:22
you can drop your image in here it'll remove the background for you
automatically and there you go now you have a nice headshot that you can use
maybe you want to put a little bit fancier of a background maybe like a
brick wall or something behind you but that's it
go in front of a window with some nice natural light
remove the background in case there's something weird in the background and
and that's it cool um i recommend setting up your current
role as software engineer at 100 devs right just so that you can start the the
internal recruiter clock of you being a software engineer
set your location so that folks that are local to you can find you
and make sure your contact info is updated make sure you've linked your
stuff together make sure that once you set up your twitter your portfolio or
github you're linking all these things together
because that's going to help the seo so that when someone googles you

01:23
right so when someone googles you right they can find all your related
information so you can pass that sniff test right cool
what if we want to move that's a really good question you should be targeting
these locations and things for the place where you want to work
so a lot of folks might be in like a smaller city but they're open to moving
to a bigger city put that bigger city on all your stuff
what if they asked we did 100 devs you got clients
what did they ask current salary no you're a freelancer you worked with clients
clients that you got and eventually clients that also 100 devs provided as

01:24
well so it is contract work as a lot of agencies already are
make sure you personalize your linkedin url you can actually get your first name
last name please make sure you have like
your first name last name as your actual
url basically we're trying to make it so that people can find you and anything
that you can get first name last name on is gonna help have all that good stuff
pop up when people look for you um about section you're gonna put your
blurb in there there's a lot of these different things
that we're gonna ask you to do that are all part of this checklist and so like i
said a lot a lot of hard work but if you can do all these little things it all
starts to tip the odds in your favor now the last thing i'll ask you to do
is to join the hundred devs linkedin group and
we have hundreds of people in that linkedin group already
one thing i'm going to do is i'm going to ask you to all join tonight
i have to approve you i will not approve you if you do not
have your linkedin profile filled out so if you don't have a photo and you don't

01:25
have like your role listed i'm not going to approve you
right so you must you must have like an actual photo yeah you have to have like
your role listed and if you don't have those things listed
you're not going to get accepted into the linkedin group but i want everyone
to go ahead and sign up for it and then once you are approved so i'll
approve everyone tonight tomorrow depending on how many folks sign up
initially right once you get approved i want you to do something
i want you to find five individuals that are in the group and connect with them
right five individuals that are already in the group and connect with them
once you connect with them i want you to endorse them for
javascript node and react so that means everyone tonight needs to have those

01:26
skills on their linkedin profile i want you to have javascript node and
react so once you get approved to the hundred devs group find five
folks connect with them and then endorse javascript know it and react right
and so we're gonna have a couple nights where i asked you to do this
and we're gonna keep the circle going and so by the end of 100 devs we should
have i don't know 10 to 20 kind of endorsements uh that way that the
recruiters that use that stuff right right the when the recruiters start to
add that stuff look at that stuff you start to show up in the searches
for those skills now remember when you connect with folks what do we always do
whenever we connect with someone on linkedin
what is absolutely imperative that you do when you connect with someone
you add a message you send a note exactly if anyone from 100 devs sends you a

01:27
connection without a message ignore just ignore them always
always introduce yourself always send a message right always send a message
and if you get one that doesn't boop disappear cool
the link to the group is in uh the slides i believe we also have a command
for it as well might be linkedin let's see uh yep we have exclamation point
linkedin is the command and uh this is the group i'll spam it in chat
like i said i won't add you unless you got your your photo
and your roll and everything on there so make sure you fill it out before you

01:28
join beautiful so you set up your twitter
you have set up your linkedin your angel list uh you have set up a portfolio
right you set up a portfolio we've talked about the portfolio we've
talked about the resume we have a whole class on how to set up your resume so
i'm kind of going quickly through these little bits because we've already
covered a lot of it in our resume class but the thing i'll show you about the
portfolio if we look at sean's portfolio sean's portfolio was a beautiful
html5 up template they listed their their projects
and they wound up getting a job at amazon
their original profile didn't even have a url it was just the netlify
url and so you don't need to go out there and spend a bunch of money on a
domain name you don't need to have custom design

01:29
you can have a template and focus your energy on doing all the stuff that
really moves the needle right really moves the needle
when it comes time to getting a job can you host your site on github yeah
you can github pages is cool um but i i i just have a preference for netlify i
use them for everything cool all right the rule of thumb is if you're a designer
go ahead and design your portfolio otherwise if you are not a designer
go ahead and use a template the templates that we shared in the past
were html5 up pretty much all of my students used html5 up templates
and they've all got a wonderful jobs uh after you get your first client

01:30
sometimes folks like to upgrade uh to use like more fancy templates or custom
design but right out the gate you can get non-shady templates to use cool
hosting for your portfolio i just use netlify
netify.com drop is super easy just drag your portfolio onto it it'll host it for
you you can use an actual domain or you can set up a netlife domain for free
so you don't need to do anything that costs money for this whole process cool
uh domains if you do decide that you want to buy like your first name last
name or something like that my two go-to's their name cheap and i want my
name uh they're the only domain registrars that i kind of use and trust
we covered a lot of this in the resume class um and then we do have the resume
template that is linked in both the professional checklist

01:31
and uh here in the slides and so for your resume
you definitely want to make sure that you are using the bob coder template
just use the template please just use my template it works
it's worked time and time again with so many different students and remember
we are not applying we're not clicking apply right we are not clicking
apply so does it matter if our template is readable by the robots does it matter
if our resume is crafted perfectly so the robots pick it up and take a and and

01:32
no it just doesn't matter no it doesn't this this template is pretty damn good
it's pretty damn good it's gonna work pretty well with most of the like auto
reading resume programs right it's gonna it's gonna help with most of
the auto reading programs but this one works better for passing
the sniff test so i've done things in a slightly different way
that helps it so that folks that are spending six seconds actually reading
the resume right get the stuff that they need so they can
make their decision and pass you on to the nerds
i'm not interested in competing against the computer i'm trying to game a human
to getting me to talk to the next person
in the in the chain right of getting the interview right that's the goal

01:33
this template works it's helped hundreds of people get jobs use it
you're gonna notice some things in here that we talked about during our resume
class i recommend having software engineer 100
devs your big projects in the client work that you did if you did other
client work having kind of a section for
your client work and then like one other role
for folks that have more history that have done more stuff
this might slightly change to where you're just gonna roll your freelancing
into your experience at 100 devs right and then you might have more space
down here for your other roles that's it right and so it's up to you to take a
look at this but it should be one page and you should
stick to conveying everything in that one page uh if you're if you're kind of
hung up you don't know what to put on your resume we have a full class

01:34
on just the resume that you can come back and watch remember tonight we have
a lot of stuff to get through so go back
and watch that full class if you're like leon why do i put 100 devs how do i how
do i talk about myself what skills do i put how do i talk about my education go
back and watch that resume class we cover everything about the resume cool
so we've now built out a beautiful beautiful twitter
we've built a beautiful linkedin and angel list we have our beautiful
portfolio we have it fully hosted we have a beautiful built out resume right
built out resume nope the resume classes on youtube we
just cut off the part where we had um where we shared other folks resumes it's
class 25 you know on youtube yep cool beautiful resume
so we have all these things that we've now worked on that are manicured that

01:35
are perfect they're gonna help us pass the sniff test you're like well how
do i make it perfect what do i have to do for linkedin what do i have to do
it's all in the checklist baby it's all in the checklist
it's a checklist literally just go through and do the checklist come on now
i got you it's a checklist just follow the checklist all right um
also once we get to the hit list just know that we'll be making
a lot of different versions of our resume i think where a lot of folks mess up
when it comes to the hunt is they think that one size fits all and
it doesn't so we're going to do a lot of customization
a lot of customization to our resumes and you're going to wind up with like 30
different versions of your resume so get your first version done

01:36
make sure that it looks good through cv compiler don't pay for anything and
know that we're gonna kind of have a lot
of different versions of our resume just
like we have a lot of different versions of our cover letter
cover letters kind of aren't super super important anymore there are still a lot
of places that ask for them so it's worthwhile to have your version of the
cover letter and you know how i do i've given you an example
so you're going to take this example and you're going to plug in the pieces
that make sense for you you're going to take out the stuff that doesn't make
sense to you right and you're going to have just something to work with right
something to start with and then once we get into the hunt we're going to make
lots of different versions of this right yeah
so for now just have a basic one as we get deeper into the hunt right as we get
deeper into the hunt uh we'll spend more time on this we'll have multiple

01:37
versions of it right tonight is about seeing all the things that you have to
prepare right then the slides if you all the slides
are linked so if you click the bob boberson it'll take you to the cover
letter all this stuff is stuff you have to start working on that you have to
start crafting right like i said a lot of work and so now you have
examples for everything you got to start tweaking it to yourself all right
gotta have your github set up remember this is all just for that per that first
sniff test that first sniff test uh i can't message someone i can only
connect yeah when you connect you can include a message
yeah when you connect with someone you can include a message as you're
connecting you can't just send someone a message you leave a you have a note as
you connect with someone so yeah you don't need premium you don't have to pay
anything on linkedin when you connect with them you add a note right it's
called add a note and so you add the note and that's how you do it that's it

01:38
you don't need to send like a separate message is just add a note as you are
connecting with them cool all right github super important
don't pay exactly blah said it do not pay you don't have to pay for anything
not to pay for anything in this whole entire process this whole entire journey
the whole point is that we do it for free you don't have to pay for any of
this stuff anything i ever show you do not pay there's nothing to be paid here
what should the note say you should introduce yourself
and let them know the reason why you're connected
blah said i invested time and then eight
dollars for my domain name that's it now they have a beautiful wonderful job hey

01:39
cool now github you don't want some uh you don't want some crummy github you
want to you want a good github look let's look at let's look at charles's github
i love charles they were one of my students at rc uh they they grinded it out
they grinded it out like hold on i just need you to think about let's just see
this no i gotta talk i gotta say i gotta say something about sean
he said charles sean i gotta talk about something i
gotta talk sean's i gotta talk sean's talk all right
but let's look at their github look at this beautiful github
their beautiful name links to all their beautiful stuff right
links to their website links to their projects and look at at least their
projects look there's two different kinds of people in this world
there are some people that just put images
and there's some people that put gifts you know what i'm saying
there's some people that just put images and then there are some people that put

01:40
gifts that that take that extra step that go that little extra mile right
come on now way to connect ah look at their code wars they keep it public
they keep it public oh i'm still scrolling baby oh
look at the flex at the end too completed over 1 000 plus challenges and
push five solutions every week the recruiter that just came to this page
they saw oh the recruiter's just like that's what the recruiter did
they got hit with the gifts they're like oh
then they got hit with the code where people
they scrolled to the bottom and then they got hit come on now

01:41
come on now now see some people some people
some people say leon i applied to all these jobs i didn't get a job
and then there are some people that are out here doing this
they put in the work that's what i'm talking when i say you got to put in the
work right all men are created equal some work harder in pre-season
this is what i'm talking about this isn't hard but it's work
it's not hard but it's work they were not happy
to just put basic stuff on their profile they were not happy
to just have all their code wars in a repo they had to go and fill out the

01:42
full template and what i want you to note i want you to know look look look look
look look at the format here how it's made optimizations lessons learned
where'd they get that where'd they get that from
the readme template that i gave you in the slides that's part of the
checklist would you imagine look at this so this is a template that alec ortega
one of our longest standing mentors at resilient coders they put this together
look at this name of the project brief sentence or
two about it link to where it's hosted an image of it how it's made
optimizations you make lessons learned examples every single thing
you put on github needs to have this template full stop every project you put on

01:43
github needs to have this template and here's why it looks great
recruiters that are just taking a look through your github they see this oh
you smell great right you smell great you're going to
the next round right and i'll tell you why because even if they're a little bit
more technical right if they're a little bit more
technical they see it what you built they see it live they see the
technologies you're hitting that seo stuff you're hitting that seo game but
here's my favorite part i got two favorite parts here the optimizations
leon i don't have enough time to do everything i wanted to do great
put it in the optimizations because when the engineer is coming to your site and
they're like well it would have been really great if they would have done
this or it would have been really good if they done that well guess what you
don't have to do it just put it in the optimizations

01:44
right now the engineer that's looking at this will go oh
if they had more time they would have used typescript or they did have more
time they would have used sql instead right so now you put your optimizations
in there and now the engineers think that you know what the heck you're
talking about and you didn't have to put in the work boom
and then i want recruiters to get lost in my stuff i want them to be like
and so at the end you link to all your other repos
right you link to all your other repo so
they can go from one repo to the next to the next get lost in it
they're they're just they just can't wait to send you to the next round of
the interview right so we'll notice that sean

01:45
the thing that i loved about sean is they always
did it they just put in the work right they didn't have just a regular github
right they didn't just have a regular command still i gotta scroll so far boom
they didn't just scroll they just didn't have a regular github they built it out
they used i don't know maybe like a generator that i linked here in the slides
i don't know maybe they maybe they use the profile generator like leon how do i
make a beautiful profile boom generator fill out your stuff it'll give you the
readme file that you can put on your github done
i hope that you're seeing tonight that i'm not just telling you to do stuff i'm
literally giving you exactly how to do it
you want a resume resume example when a cover letter cover letter example you
want a github not only will i give you examples i will give you the generator

01:46
to generate it some folks when i told you go build a
github some folks might told you go build a resume nah
i'm giving you the examples that you can use that have helped hundreds of other
folks you just gotta do the work so your github you use a profile
generator to make a beautiful profile just like sean take it that extra step
don't be happy with just regular images make gifs
make sure your content is linked oh oh baby

01:47
i need to take a walk i'll be right back i need some water [Laughter]
joe blow said me versus the guy the recruiter tells me not to worry about
all right so i'm going to ask you a question here
let's forget that sean went to amazon and did their thing there
without knowing that sean went to amazon and was an engineer there for a while
just by looking at what you see here does sean know how to code yes
there's not a single thing that the gatekeeping [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] could say

01:48
to sean they've pushed code every single day
they made all the code that they pushed public you can see their coding
challenges if i'm interviewing sean think about this think about this hold
on this is really really important focus on this this is super important i need
you to think about this i need you to think about this please
please focus on this put the wrong headphones in sorry i need
to focus on this one second one second think about this i have interviewed
hundreds of people right hundreds of engineers i personally
have interviewed engineers right sometimes great engineers
fumble during coding challenges coding challenges suck
sometimes you could be a great engineer but mess up a coding challenge it's not
your day and it would be horrible if i let a great engineer go

01:49
because the the the the stress of the technical interview got them on that day
but if i looked at someone's profile and i saw that they publicly pushed
a thousand coding challenges right and i saw that their github they've
pushed a challenge every day for a year plus am i likely
to give them a second shot am i likely to think and say you know
what it might have been me and not them yes [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes
hell yes abso freaking lutely there's no
way as someone that was hiring engineers
that i could look at this github and not think it might have been an off day or
better yet if they sent me an email saying hey leon
i really appreciate you taking the time to interview me i really appreciate

01:50
getting to know you and the team i just want to let you know that it wasn't my
best day i i had some really rough stuff happen
in the morning i i just wasn't in my element for these coding challenges i
know i can do a much better job is there
any chance that you can give me a second shot at the technical interview i know
on a good day i could really rock it you can see my coding challenges in this
repo i really do live this life i would really appreciate a second shot
all day long i'm giving that person a second shot all day long right so is this
let's think about this for a second is this hard i don't think so
i think every single person here could do this

01:51
i think every single person here could use the literal generator i've given you
and then do a code war as a day i think you could now not everyone has
the super privilege of time but barring that aside
i think every single person here it's it's not a it's not a hard thing
it's a making it work 10 a work thing right and and and putting in that little
extra bit of work right and so if you have the privilege of time
please don't waste it please don't right
because this is just one code wars a day consistently
and if you do this if you do all the little things that we've talked about right
if you do all the little things that we've talked about you're setting
yourself up for a phenomenal career there's not many things that we can do

01:52
in life where at the end of the day someone's going to give us 80 grand
right there's there's not three things that we could do at the end of the day
where if we do these things these little things right
we do these little things every day it could lead to a phenomenal career
that's high paid has really good growth that that enables us to be happy
that has really good benefits right like there's not many things that in life
where if we just do these little things every day
that we could lead to something like that right
and so i i just hope that you see that there's a way to do something and then
there's a way to do something and what i'm asking you to do is to do something

01:53
right i'm giving you all this stuff and the reason why i'm giving it to you
why the reason why i'm asking you to to to to do these things that seem
silly adding 50 people on twitter engaging with their posts having a good
linkedin angelist having a good portfolio having a good a a a good
well-hosted portfolio having a good resume having a cover letter having a
good github doing your code wars daily is because if
you do all these things in aggregate you become a beast an unstoppable
job-getting beast and it's just doing these little things that no one else
wants to do i'm telling you other folks do not want to put in this work
tell me how i know that other folks aren't putting in this
work look at this slide having trouble finding a job out of college

01:54
400 plus applications with no luck nah son not luck you need
you haven't been doing it right honestly you haven't been doing it right
you didn't realize that you smelled and you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that's it
there's a process to get a job some folks put in the work to do that
process and other folks write these kinds of posts on reddit
that's it that's all it is to it we don't apply we never click apply
there's never going to be a post from somebody from 100 devs doing this

01:55
because we don't apply we get networked in we get referred in
and we're going to talk about how to do that we're going to talk about how to
get referred into these jobs so that you are not making one of these posts so
for the top of the hour we're gonna put five minutes on the clock when we come
back from our break i'm going to talk to you about how to get referred
into positions so that you are not applying because we do not click apply
all right folks five minutes on the clock we're gonna take a break when we
come back from break we're going to talk through how to get referred
but i hope that you're taking everything in the heart so far you understand
there's a lot of little things to be done and if you do these things
you're opening door after door after door it's going to hap that's going to
help you pass that sniff test and get a job

01:56
all right uh we had somebody redeem jet eternal added two minutes to the timer
so this five minute break is now a seven minute break
i will see you all in seven minutes with your extra two minutes i recommend
making sure that you join the linkedin group maybe think a little bit about your
story then if you're able get up move around hydrate look out the window
do something that's going to enable you to take some stress off your eyeballs

01:58

01:59

02:02
i just really like this gif there we go all right right back [Music]
yep project everything is available immediately on twitch as a vod and then
on youtube exclamation point youtube if you're new
here make sure you join our discord that's where you'll get all the all the
goods exclamation point discord if you're new we're running a 30 week software
engineering bootcamp exclamation point 100 devs to learn more

02:03
how about a minute left folks here at storm welcome
ah should we stop posting 100 days of code does that give us a way of students
too much no you can you can you can be doing all that stuff and then once we
get deeper into the hunt we'll slow down with the
the boot camp rich stuff but we're not at that point yet you can still be doing
all your stuff on twitter all that fun stuff yeah
okay should we be pushing private or public it's up to you recruiters are
going to dig through each repo um it's up to you though yeah
i keep everything most of my stuff is public stuff that is private make sure
you have the setting where when you contribute to a private repo you still
get credit with your green squares but you saw how impressive it was for

02:04
sean have all of their coding challenges there to have that growth to be visible
that's pretty damn impressive all right folks come on back come on back
time for a different twitter yeah definitely uh some folks if you just
have wild twitters having like a professional twitter could be helpful i
don't mean like the setting where you turn your twitter into a professional
one i don't i don't use that i just mean that like if you have like something
where you just been while in on socials then it might behoove you to start a new
social also remember that a lot of people signed up for twitter with their phone
number so i've had employers like put in people's phone numbers on twitter and
that's how they got got so be careful i deleted my og tutor 2 wild on
that one yeah yeah i see that all right so remember

02:05
we're not clicking apply folks clicking apply does not work clicking apply
does not work okay you're saying leon clicking apply doesn't work what do we do
we get referred remember how i said that every single
not everything but most companies have referral programs if you are not getting
referrals you are going up against folks that are getting referrals you are not
going to make it past that first round because you're not getting referred and
you're going up against people that are getting referred it's a fool's errand
and so the referral process is super important
because it gives you an evil play even playing field but it also typically
helps you skip one of the first rounds of the interview process and so when we
talk about the interview process as a whole we'll notice that if you're
getting referred you'll often skip that first phone screen or that first kind of

02:06
thing that's in your path of getting to the actual technical interview cool so
[Laughter] the hit list aka probably the most important thing that
you will ever do for your career it's not learning node it's not learning
javascript your hit list hit list is probably the most important thing you
will ever do for your career so what is a hit list a hit list is
taking individuals that you're meeting or sorry individuals that you want to
interact with for a job literally adding them to a list and
networking and reaching out to them so what we're going to wind up doing
is using the sheet so you can do exclamation point sheet in
chat or click the link in the slides and

02:07
when you pull up the sheet you'll notice there is two tabs we have been using
this how can i do this without me being in the way hold on
we have been using the first tab for our networking but there is a second tab
for the hit list all right and so if we look at the hit list
we'll notice that there are quite a few things on here you're going to see
company name date added to spreadsheet url role
position type of position source name per business company email applied date
application coffee chat thank you date coffee chat interview
date so there's a lot of stuff here and what we are doing
is identifying companies that we want to work at

02:08
adding these companies to our hit list and then finding the points of contact
at those companies to reach out to none of these are editable you have to
make your own copy you have to do file make a copy this is my copy i don't need
you riffraff putting nonsense in here so
you make your you make your own copy and um and then you can edit your own copy
so your hit list is legitimately a list and what do i mean by list well
you are going to network your way in to 60 applications
let's say again you are going to network your way into 60 applications
that means for 60 applications you are going to be recommended

02:09
not click apply you literally get a referral into that open position [Music] so
we're gonna have classes on how we do this properly but the gist
is find open roles that are in your area that are things that are in your scope
of possibility entry-level software engineering roles roles that require one
to three years of experience right you're going to add these roles to your sheet
and then you're going to start finding people that actually work at these
companies now what people are we targeting well

02:10
first we're going to find a hiring manager right so if there is a company that
we're interested in that has an open opportunity
we're going to find the hiring manager at that company now typically
if you're like a really big company this is gonna be hard to find
but most of us are not gonna be applying to like big thousand two thousand plus
companies we're probably applying to like 100 to 500 person companies
and so the first person you want to try and find
is the hiring manager that's responsible for that role so if it's a software
engineering role on a certain team you're going to try and find the person
who has authority on that team you're going to add them to your hit list
you're going to follow them on twitter you're going to find their email using
hunter io and you're going to ask for a coffee chat
now we're gonna have a whole class on this process like if you're freaking out

02:11
and panicking about how you do this don't worry i'm gonna walk you through it
if you go to our youtube we literally have three classes where i do this live
like finding the opportunity finding the person at the opportunity
figuring out how to contact them adding them to my hit list like this is going
to be a whole class i'll give you a taste give you a taste but we're going to
literally have three classes where all i do is put on hard edm music and do this
live right and so don't worry we're gonna do it together
but it's something you need to start thinking about right now because this is
how you get a job cool so uh you found a role
you added that role to your hit list you put the name when you added it to the
hit list the url for the role probably on something like angel list or
something like that you put the title the role software engineer um

02:12
type of position front end source right like the like where you
found it angel list or whatever and this
is where you're gonna put your points of contact you're to find the hiring
manager first and your goal is to get a coffee chat with that hiring manager
right and most of the time you're not going to be like hey
i want to work at your company can we talk no most of the time you're going to
say hey i saw that you work in boston and that you're really into
typescript is something i've been getting more into would you be up to
having a coffee chat i would love to learn more about kind of how you got to
where you are and your your career as a software engineer right
so kind of wait a minute hold on leon you mean that all the networking that
you've made us do right all the networking made us do all
that outreach and getting coffee chats you you mean to tell me that was all
preparing us to do that in a more targeted way for the hit list yes

02:13
that's what it was the reason why we did all of the networking and practice
before was because we're getting practice to
make this part a little bit easier for us cool
so you're going to ask for a coffee chat you're you're not going to be up front
you're not going to say like you have a job i want to talk to you about the job
you're going to try and get to know them a little bit schmooze a little bit
and then if it comes up and a lot of times it does come up like probably 70
of the time they'll say hey we have an open role at the company
would you be interested and you'll go oh you do have an open role you say
okay yeah would you mind referring me for that role
and they'll go yeah sure i'll happily refer you and open role you say exactly
right but if it doesn't come up during your conversation be smooth play it cool
follow up the coffee chat say thank them for their time

02:14
provide a little bit of value hey we you
told me that you you really like pokemon i don't know if you saw they released
some new information about violet coming out soon like here you go have a great
rest of your week then two weeks later right two weeks later after you've been
liking their stuff on twitter right you've been retweeting some stuff here
or there send them another email hey i see that
there's an open role at your company uh if you remember we talked two weeks ago
i really enjoyed our conversation would you mind referring me for this open role
and they'll go yeah of course sure why not we met your normal human being
you're a software engineer why not it's an easy 5k for me if it works out

02:15
all right it's not creepy folks it's networking all right cool so 99 of the time
they're gonna say yes because they want the referral bonus it's how it works
right and so you've reached out to the hiring manager you added them to the hit
list you followed them on twitter you found their email you asked for a coffee
chat either it came up during the chat or after two weeks of kind of
kind of letting the the the words simmer and you kind of engaging with their
content online you get the recommendation right it's not creepy
you know why because folks that get jobs do this
and folks that don't understand how folks get jobs
think it's creepy i know it's weird and i know it's kind of a harsh thing to say
but vlaw said it best it's only weird if you make it weird
right like being good at your career and networking and uh getting to know folks
so that you can progress your career is not it's not weird unless you make it

02:16
weird and a lot of folks that think it's weird is because they're not
good at the process and we're here to get good at the process right
just because effect doesn't mean it's not creepy no it it it it is effective
it's not creepy networking is a big part of how we operate in getting jobs
right and so if you are not doing this know that the tide is against you
and a lot of folks that don't get jobs that wallow around
is because they never get good at this process
because they're going up against folks that are
doing this process if there's anything that i can get into your brain
is that there are people out there doing this process and they're doing it
really well and the excuses you come up with to not
do this process is what's going to hold you back from getting better and better

02:17
jobs and so i need you to take that to heart
right i need you to take that to heart that there are folks that are playing
this game and getting phenomenal jobs and if you're not playing this game you
are at a severe disadvantage and folks that are professionals
especially folks that are in hiring positions
they know how this game is being played right as someone that hired a lot of
folks i expect people to be playing this game
if you're not playing this game you're at a disadvantage it's not creepy
it's networking don't make it creepy though don't be the weird person doing this

02:18
keep it professional right keep it professional no one wants to date you
right no one wants to date you keep it professional provide value
right provide value and this is how it works
won't they feel used no they're getting they're getting 10k
they're getting five ten thousand dollars because you did this most places have
referral bonuses so literally by you reaching out to them
and going through this process they're getting ten thousand dollars
i'll take a coffee chat for ten thousand dollars
you scratch my back i'll scratch yours exactly but notice how i always said
provide value even if someone's giving your time
notice the very first thing i say send them a thank you thank them for their

02:19
time provide value in that moment right it doesn't have to be a lot of value but
something that they mentioned give them some value make it worth having talked
to you right and then stay in contact once you get
the job it doesn't mean that this process stops remember
software engineering is a cumulative career right meaning that you're gonna keep
growing you're gonna switch jobs maybe maybe for your first kind of few years
every two years one year you're switching to a new role well guess what
you're going to stay in touch with these people maybe a little less frequently
right a little less frequently but you stay in touch that you can keep up this
and keep getting new opportunities if i wanted a new opportunity i'm never
applying anywhere like if i wanted a new job i would i
wanted to make this clear like i'm not applying anywhere every
week for years i went to networking events
i built up my network i had hundreds of coffee chats and i still do coffee chats

02:20
with folks all the time when i need a new role i'm never
applying anywhere i'm just going to talk to someone in my network and say hey i
saw you have an open role do you mind giving me the referral
and so if you don't have that network yet this is when it starts
and we're doing it in a targeted way where we're targeting
60 companies that we know have open roles that are in our area
right that are in our area or remote if you're going remote and we're building
this foundation for your network for the rest of your life
don't see this as a small transaction see this is a transaction for the span
of your 20 to 40 year career cool all right now you talk to the hiring manager
then find an engineer on the team and do the same thing

02:21
right find an engineer on the team and then do the same thing add them to your
hit list follow them on twitter find their email ask for a coffee chat say
thank you provide value get the recommendation right if it doesn't come up
right if it doesn't come up in that initial coffee chat wait your two weeks
and then shoot your shot for the recommendation all right
so you've talked to the engineering manager you talked to the engineer on
the team then you talk to the recruiter you're like leon why don't you talk to
the recruiter first well i'll tell you why why do you think i didn't talk to the
recruiter first yeah now i got some names to drop when i talk to the recruiter
i'm gonna say hey i talked to john i talked to bob they're amazing people i
really had a good time getting to know them me and bob went out for coffee last

02:22
week great guy i saw that you have an open role and i
just wanted to see if there's anything i could do to kind of push my application
along and the recruiter's gonna go wait a minute you know bob you know john
you met you met jane for coffee last week and they like you
they already like you oh they like you okay well let let's set up the interview
let's um let let's get you through to the next round then
right if bob john and jane all know you already the recruiter would be kind of
not a good recruiter to send you to the next round

02:23
right they'd be kind of wild to not send you to the next round right
and so of course you're like oh you know bob you know john you know jane all
right boom next round okay and then when you get to the next round
who's going to interview you probably bob probably jane
probably john the folks you already talked to so can you see how this process
might open a few more doors if you can get this this thing going right because
if you've already talked to these people you've already had coffee chats with
them the recruiter already knows that you've
talked to them and know them maybe they even referred you

02:24
and then the recruiter goes and looks at your github and sees this it's over
it's over it's a wrap it's a cut they're
not even going to interview other people and so the thing i'll tell you about
last cohort is that half of the folks that got jobs last cohort
did not have technical interviews you say let me say one more time for the
folks in the back half the folks that got jobs last cohort
did not have technical interviews and when i say things i mean like they
didn't do coding challenges right i mean they didn't do coding challenges

02:25
meaning that they talked to real living breathing humans they showed them their
github they showed them the projects that they built they had real
conversations with them about meaty technical topics and that was enough
because remember if you can make it to the nerds it's really two questions can
you do i want to work with you for the next two years right
and so if you do all these things if all your stuff is set up correctly and
and you do the hit list process and you get recommended
it's a wrap it's a game over you might not even make it to the technical
interviews now we're going to talk about technology
because we're all about open as many doors as possible but i have had
hundreds of students hundreds of students get jobs
without technical interviews because they they balled out on this process they

02:26
took their hit list very very seriously this was their life for three months
this is it this is the big secret it's the hit list
is it 60 people for 20 companies no it's 60 companies
that means you might be talking to 180 people across these 60 companies
we don't get got we go right so you you found the hiring
manager boom you found the engineer on the team boom you found the recruiter
boom you found their mama boom all on the hit list
right you add them to hit list you follow them on twitter you find their
email you ask for a coffee chat you send a thank you note and then you get the
recommendation betty it's been amazing playing bridge
with you these past two weeks uh you mentioned that your son john uh works at
such and such company could you give me a connection to john please i would love

02:27
to to join an amazing company such as your son john's
right now now this part's a little this might be the creepy part yeah this is
the creepy part sorry this is where it gets a little creepy so maybe maybe
maybe not therma but definitely the hiring manager
the the engineers on the team the recruiter uh maybe maybe we leave the
mama out of it i don't know like i said i'm going to show you how to play the
game it's up to you if you want to play it i'm just saying moms are kind of soft
all right they they they they just want their their children to have more
friends and uh if you come along and want to be
their their child's friend it might work i don't know
mom sees mom sees their their child and you and they're more like i don't know
like i said how you play the game it's up to you cool but at the end of the day

02:28
please don't ever ever ever does this work ever does this [Music]
ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
and we say bye bye beautiful all right if we do not ever
click apply it doesn't work you're wasting your time you're wasting your time
you might as well print out your resume throw it in a trash can

02:29
have a car hit a raccoon way more likely than you clicking
you're clicking apply please don't do it it doesn't work get referred all right
now i said 60 60 networked recommend so click apply how do i how do
i time out a mod let me see here sorry never click apply so and we're talking
about 60 well networked applications right we're talking about 60
well-networked applications it does break down into some simple numbers
all right it does break down into some simple numbers first
you're going to have 30 high value applications right
where for 30 of those 60 companies you're going to have customer custom resumes

02:30
cover letters and a story that matches why you are showing up there
somebody give me a give me a a type of company give me a company i don't care
a company does something airbnb all right airbnb
cool so we were a server at a restaurant for 10 years that was a story we had
earlier um for 10 years i worked in the service
industry every day i use software that i hate it working on pos systems that
really just didn't work and so i committed my knights to learning how to
code and started building software that i would love to use on the job
eventually i started taking on clients when the pandemic kit i
realized two things were happening one the service industry was being hit
but also industries like airbnb were being hit as
well and so i started to build tools that would help folks

02:31
during these difficult times and start to take on more and more clients
eventually get tired with the cl with the agency life and now i want to join a
product team such as yours at airbnb where i can work on products that
increase everyone's lives but also continue the work i did during the
pandemic to help folks find easier accommodations and restaurants that were
covet safe right i don't know like right off the
door right like just like you you tie whatever it was your story into where
you're applying right and so if you know you're applying to airbnb and you know
that you're in a service industry you would build a small app right or
or tie your story into how that service industry was uh equally wrecked as the
airbnb industry right and you can bring that up as part of your story so
somebody that's airbnb is like oh yeah we did have a rough time during covet
right did have a rough time at covet i i see kind of like why you made that
transition that makes sense right and so we can find a way for 30 of
our applications to have a custom resume a custom cover

02:32
letter and a custom story that matches that that company
well somebody come through with um e1 hey thank you for the five get the
subs hope you're doing well thank you for being here right and so
for 30 applications not only networking in right
all right not only networking in but we're also doing a lot of custom
stuff for those those applications then we're going to have 10 premium
applications 10 premium applications where we do all of that
plus we build a custom landing page on our portfolio for that company plus we
probably tweet something in relation to that company maybe we make a blog post
about something in relation to that company and we have a small project that

02:33
took like a day or two right a day or two right right a day or two on
that application right so 10 of them are going to be
pretty serious applications where when you're talking to these engineers
when you're talking to the hiring manager when you're talking to these
folks that we're talking to right now you have some more stuff to talk
about oh your air and baby well i did make this little quick kind of like
reservation app i felt like most booking sites have a really bad user experience
so here's my booking flow that i think works best for a lot of folks
right so there's something really small maybe took you a day or two to build out
a small little app right and so that is 30 well networked recommended
applications 10 super premium applications where you've gone the extra
mile you built a little bit something that you can bring up during those

02:34
interviews and then that leaves 20 others 20 others are just our generic
interviews you're going to have 20 just generic interviews where you try to get
recommended you go through that first you make all your mistakes
and then you hit up your 30 and then you hit up your 10. all right
you talk about what you mean by a landing page it's just a just a part of
your portfolio that's geared towards that company that's all it is yeah
oh danny dropping some heat about the resumes
and we gotta we gotta we gotta get you on stream so we can we can dig into

02:35
resumes a little bit with you that'd be cool i'll reach out to you on twitter
so we talked about 60 60 well-networked recommended applications right 60
30 where it's going to be our high value apps we're doing individual work for
each of them 10 premium and then 20 where we were testing the water because
out of 60 and this is where we take some of the stress off of our shoulder
out of the 60 networked hey i appreciate it i appreciate it i'll
reach out to you cool out of the 60 you have to understand no matter how
well we do this process no matter how well we network our way in

02:36
no matter how well we do this entire process we're going to have 10 interviews
that just go horribly wrong like just slap their mama by accident wrong right
just you yeah you just you you just sneeze
and snot goes all over the interviewer right bad right we just know we're gonna
we're gonna have 10 of them right leave the mamas alone you're calling
them you're doing the yeah all right we'll leave the mama's alone right that
just go absolutely horrendous and that's okay that's why we do 60.
right that's why we do 60. 10 are gonna go absolutely horrendously wrong
40 are gonna go okay and ten are where the magic happens
where all the little things we talked about tonight come together in just that

02:37
perfect way you hit it off with the interviewer in the right way and it
leads to passing that sniff test with flying colors it leads into an interview
process that just works right and so we got to give ourselves these 60
so we can get through 10 that go really bad 40 where we learn our lessons and 10
that just goes really well should we dress for an interview in the suit
so the thing i always like is you dress one level above the folks that you're
interviewing with so if they wear t-shirts and shorts you
wear nice pants and a button-up or a nice blouse right and so just i always
say like one level over if you're at a fintech company and
they're all wearing like button-ups and and and like a tie then then you
wear a suit right um but you can ask and a lot of this right
a lot of this a lot of this like interviewing and we're going to talk

02:38
about this a little bit further in a lot of it is just going into this with a
game plan you can always ask i don't know why
anybody talks about this you can always ask your interview
what you're what you're going into you can always ask your interview
interviewer hey i have an interview set up for friday
what is that interview going to be like is it behavioral is it technical
and should i what's the dress code like at the office
is there something i should be wearing what a normal folks interview where right
you should always ask always ask right fintech is financial technology
right you can always ask and so you should always ask what the interview is
going to be like you should always ask what you're walking into so that's not a
guess cool don't worry we haven't gotten to
behavioral interviews we haven't gotten into like the actual process yet
that's coming up so that doesn't make too much no way we're going to get there
all right some other things we have to add to our

02:39
list folks i told you there's a lot of work to be done a lot of work to be done
well not only do we have all of our professional stuff in a line all of our
online presence in a line not only have we invested time into our hit list
finding great opportunities getting referrals into these opportunities but
we're also going to have a hundred hours
project a hundred dollars project is the culmination of everything that we learn
here at 100 devs and we put all of that knowledge into one project
a project that you've built on your own that you've built from scratch that
you've loved and nurtured across 100 hours so that when you're in an interview
right when you're in an interview you can show this project off
this project is what has gotten people jobs when they say
what show me that you can code when you try to pass that

02:40
coding sniff test they can look at your 100 project and see oh
they know how to code not only have they been pushing a code wars every
day not only do they have amazing stuff on their github portfolio but they have
this project that they know intimately that they've built over the course of a
hundred hours right that you can bring up during your
interviews that can highlight all the things that you know and all the things
that you learned it's really important the other point of 100 hours project
is tying your past into your current reality
right so whatever you did in the past right whatever you did in the past we can
ease the story to where you are now with 100 hours project
it's a way of tying what you were doing before to what you are doing now

02:41
if you are a server you could build a a point of sale system if you were a
teacher you could build tools for the classroom if you
uh were a janitor you could build a mapping system for the building so you
can clean more efficiently it doesn't matter you can tie what you did before
into your abilities as a software engineer to show that progression
and make it so that it seems like you like you've been writing that
code with a purpose and a point right to get to where you are now
so not only does it stand as a thing that you can use to help you during
interviews but it helps you tie up all those loose ends as to why you are here
right now and why you're a phenomenal software engineer
and highlighting your past experiences to make you a better engineer cool so
next week next week i want to know what your 100

02:42
project is which means you got a week a good a good weekend to think through it
right a good weekend to think through it i want a quick description
and a wireframe a wireframe is just like a high level drawing
right a high level drawing of what you're going to build
uh it doesn't have to be fancy if you want to be fancy you can use things like
wireframe.cc figma which are both free i think basamic is paid now
or you could just literally draw it and take a photo i don't care
all right you just draw and take a photo that's good enough for me very very
simple but think through what you want to build
give me a description and then give me a quick wireframe
break out your nuns exactly and we're going to talk more about these
projects of course as the time goes on but just think of an idea and then over
the next couple weeks i'll help you mold that idea into something that's

02:43
practical and doable for your 100 project we're going to start what are
called mvps minimum viable products like the simplest thing we can do
to prove our point right and as we get better at the back
end and we learn more we'll be able to flesh out better what's more and more
doable but i want the idea what what's the angle you're going for and i need
that next week all right now this is a lot covered a lot tonight a lot of things
and we're not done yet we we still got like we still got like
12 minutes or so normal class time and we still got a lot more to cover we
haven't we haven't even gotten to the interviews yet we haven't even gotten to
how to interview yet i told you it was a lot i told you all
have a decision to make you all have a decision to make

02:44
and for those that make the decision that they want to go on this process go
on this journey once you make that decision the rest of your life can change
in so many phenomenal wonderful ways it can just change
and so we're talking about three months of hard work
three months of lots of little things to get done
lots of things we talked about so many different pieces tonight so many other
things to do but i'm telling you three months of hard work
of going beast mode can change your whole life it's the best thing about
working in this space is to see folks that when they showed up
they have that fire in their eye they know nothing's going to stop themselves
they put in the work right they put in the work

02:45
and at the end they get a phenomenal job so like i said i've never i've taught
thousands of people there's nothing that i've ever been able to point to
that aptitude wise told me if they were going to get a job or not
like when they came in they were really good at javascript and like that's no
it's never been how good they were at code
it was never really what they did before there have been some weird things
teachers do really well and uber drivers i said this before i've never had an
uber driver that didn't make it there's something about the hustle and i
think teachers know the grind more than anyone else and so they've always done
really well so maybe that's there's two other things i look for
but the only other thing i've ever seen across thousands of students
is folks that that made that decision they said hey leon i want it
and i'm going to do what it takes to get there because it's a lot it's a lot

02:46
there's going to be a lot of rejection there's going to be a lot of doubt
there's going to be a lot of muck to get through in the trough of sorrow that we
have left but the folks that made that decision
that came in the class the next day and said leon i want it
they all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got it it's beautiful it really is beautiful
and so i hope i really do that everyone today makes that decision
and realizes that it's not enough to want it
it's not enough to kinda want it gotta really want it you gotta know that you
gotta flip that switch in your brain that says the next three months are
gonna be hard i'm gonna have stuff to do every single day
i might not be privileged with a lot of time but i'm to figure out how to make
it work the folks that make that decision they get jobs

02:47
but you can't kind of want it so i hope i really do got a lot of people
here tonight i'm so happy that you're all here
but i hope that you make that decision you decide to go beast mode for a few
months because the grass is so much prettier
to have a job that you know is high paid high growth
super in demand phenomenal benefits year after year is one of the happiest
careers that can support you and a family that
you don't need a degree and you can learn it for free it's magic there's a
window open right now i have no idea how long that window will be open for
but let's get as many of us through it as possible word all right so on thursday

02:48
we're gonna talk about interviewing right we're going to talk about
interviewing because there's a lot of secrets about how to do the interview
process everything we talked about tonight was passing that initial
sniff test so we can get to the interview stage
right so we can get to the interview stage and then we have to cover all this
wonderful stuff about the process how do you interview how do you prepare how do
you get better at behavioral questions technical questions how do you do
technical whiteboarding how do you prepare for the whiteboard how do you go
through the whiteboarding skills all the stuff that we have to get through so
when we come back on thursday we got some bangers to get through
some some some some more of the pure heat that i have that i've learned over
the years right to help folks do well during the interview process so you have
any anxiety if you're worried about how to do well in the actual interview

02:49
you're gonna come back on thursday and we're gonna we're gonna i'm gonna
give you all the secrets i got because i've had folks that literally could not
solve the simplest of code wars that after
they kind of get these tips and tricks in their brain
things change they get better at coding challenges they get go on to do well
during technical interviews and so please start putting into practice the things
that we talked about tonight and then get ready to come back on
on thursday because i got a lot a lot of heat to bring on thursday uh it just
it's a it's a whole other ballpark that we got to get through but once you know
how to interview well the world changes right so we got a lot of stuff to get to
on thursday uh i want to do a raid uh let's go and do a raid uh let's
spread some love and positivity like we always do if you're not followed give

02:50

or the juicebox hero hope you had some fun tonight i hope you learned some
things we're going to get a little bit of review in tomorrow on on thursday but
then we will get to so much more stuff there's still
so much more stuff to do um you'll notice that there is some homework in
discord please take a look at that homework uh make sure that you're
starting to think through uh your your your professional stuff
watch this back if you need to and i will see all you wonderful folks on
thursday let's read yes youtube
