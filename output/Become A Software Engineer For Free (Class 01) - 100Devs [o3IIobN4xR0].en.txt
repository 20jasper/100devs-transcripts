00:02
oh yeah wo oh boy y'all brought some friends huh y'all BR some friends huh
let's go good morning good afternoon good evening no matter where you're coming
from hope you all are doing well welcome look at

00:03
y'all look at y'all what's going on every everybody welcome welcome welcome
hope everyone's doing well let's goo chat spicy tonight we'll turn on the
slow but for now let's let let let's let let's let's get a little a little
excited a little hyped glad you're all here you brought some friends it's good
to see you nice to meet you if this is your first time this is your first time
on Twitch just go ahead and put in first time or first into chat for me please
let's get used to using chat here folks but first if it's your first
time there's no way that I'm paying attention to the to the subs or anything
that right now I I want to see the first welcome glad you found
us now how did you find us if you uh if you if you found this from Twitter give
me a thumbs up in chat for me please you

00:04
found this from Twitter give me a thumbs up
if you found us from Reddit give us a thumbs
up hey we out here we ain't we ain't outside but we live we ain't outside but
we live what's going on everybody we got a lot of fun stuff to
get to tonight this is day one of a 30 week software engineering boot camp and
we got a lot on the plate this evening we're going to take some time to get to
know each other a little bit we're going to take some time to get to understand
the opportunity that's in front of us we're going to talk a little bit about
what it means to become a software engineer how you can actually do that
we're going to talk about how to actually learn a lot of
folks set on this path and they don't get to the end because they never
actually learned how to learn so that's what we're starting tonight and then

00:05
we're going to get to some basics of HTML so we got a lot to a lot to get
through now if you were on Discord which you all
should be exclamation point Discord and chat if you're not on
Discord there was a question and I always like to go live with a question
enables me to get to know you a little bit see where folks
lean and so the question today was would you rather have every movie
that you watch slowly transition into Shrek or would you rather every song you
listen to slowly transition into Allstar by
Smashmouth now we got a lot of shrikes in here I don't think I've seen all right
there we go I saw one all star that was It smash M be wild and recently I don't
know if you saw some of the stuff they've been getting into but I think

00:06
Shrek might be the safer bet here all right we're good we got the Shrek folks
in the house all right everybody welcome welcome welcome glad you found us glad
you're here we're about to do this thing all right so before we dive too deep
into actually learning tonight I want to
take some time to explain why we're here what we're doing and hopefully
that's what you signed up for so tonight we start a journey to becoming a
software engineer by the end of class tomorrow you will be a software
engineer let me say one more time you know what I'm going to go big Le on here
let's let's get close by the end of class on Thursday

00:07
let's say Thursday Thursday sorry class Thursday by the end of class on Thursday
you will be a software engineer you will
all have written code now there are some some nerds in the bunch that are like
well Leon just writing codes and not being a software
engineer knock it off if you can write code you understand the systems and
tools behind the code that you're writing and you conduct yourself as a
professional you're going to call yourself a software engineer we're going
to have some haters that are are going to disagree with us but
them what we're here to do today is to lay that foundation so that by the end
of 30 weeks not only you a software engineer not only have you gotten paid
clients not only have you built tons of real projects sunk a 100 hours into a
fully custom project of your own not only have you contributed to open source

00:08
but you are fully prepared to enter the workforce as a software
engineer right out the gate I'm going to tell you one thing that I hope sinks in
today don't get got we go get we don't get got we go get exactly one thing that
I hope sinks in today and that learning to code is a journey but you can do
it I've seen folks from all walks of life all shapes sizes shades Creeds do
it so I honestly believe in my heart of hearts you can do it but learning to
code is not enough we're going to talk about that later today learning to code
is not the only thing in fact it's a small part of what it takes to get a job
and so we're going to talk about the whole journey the way that you go from
maybe just figuring out if this is the career for you to actually Landing that

00:09
job and this isn't our first rodeo folks this is cohort 2 our last cohort saw
75 folks get jobs yes I know Leon you said 70 you said 72 in the Tweet well
guess what I got three more for y'all I got three more for y'all uh so we're at
75 now now that journey is a long difficult Journey but we're going to get there
together if you just turn off the screen and you never listen to me again here's
what I want you to to take away you need
a community if you're going to learn how to code you need a community when you
get stuck and something doesn't make sense you don't give up you go to your
community what we built in the last cohort is hands down the best community

00:10
to learn code live online and we're going to keep it that way so if this
isn't for you and you still want to learn how to code that's fine find your
people find your community but what we have is an amazing one and you're seeing
it in chat right now we got a lot of new folks with us tonight we got a lot of
old folks too we got a lot of alumni folks that already put in those Blood
Sweat and Tears to get their jobs but they're coming back because they want
you to be successful mentors that want you to be
successful folks that have walked this walk have talked that talk and now want
to help you do the same thing there's a lot of you I love seeing
it all right before we get too deep into it uh you're noticing a few things
happening here uh there are these these sub notifications that are going off uh
that is something that you can do on Twitch you can you can give a small

00:11
amount of money and your name pops up and the sub goes off I want to be very
very very clear you do not have to sub I know and
then somebody drops a 10 bomb I do not want you to sub honestly and anything
that does get subbed it's donate it to the nonprofit that I work at during the
day you literally cannot pay me money for anything that I do I will never ever
but any of my content behind a pay wall you will always have access to
Everything I Do for free the goal of this boot camp is for
you to go from zero experience to a job with paying
0 I will never even recommend a book a course a tutorial that is not
free right now there's a window open folks my there is a window open and in

00:12
this window you can become a software engineer for free and without a
degree and I want to help you on that Journey I'm going to tell you a little
bit about myself and how I got to that where we are now why I started this boot
camp right so I'm going to give you a little bit about a little bit about me
just so you understand the person that's going to be talking to you for the next
30 weeks so my background is I was very blessed I grew up in Philly and in sixth
grade I had a computer science class it was in
qbasic if I've got some old heads in here and maybe you know about qbasic but
it's it's it's it's it's a throwback all right now in this sixth grade computer
science class where I was writing qbasic I got a sailboat to go from one side of
the screen to the other and I I lost my  I thought I had magical powers I

00:13
was hooked I was doing anything I could do to learn how to code uh but I didn't
have a computer I definitely didn't have a laptop like that's the thing I always
wanted and my dream of Dreams was a was a laptop so I would take my my butt all
the way down to the library every day after school and Tink around with
stuff then I was blessed uh in Philly we have magnet schools I went to ens which
is engineering and Science and during high school I had two two years of C++
classes two years that's wild so I know that my background is one
of amazing privilege cuz back in the day
we didn't have programming courses and I had three years of it before I even got
to University when I got to University uh at Yale I didn't study any code I went
all in on biology uh in my mind Dr lawyer dentist was the only opportunity

00:14
the only way to change my future and so that's what I went all in on around my
junior year I started to get this entrepreneurship bug I wanted to I
wanted to build I wanted to create I wanted to build nonprofits and companies
and I started to pick up a little bit of code to like do those things to put up
landing pages and then in my senior year I dropped out of Yale
I joined an incubator called Tech Stars I raised a bunch of money uh for my
first company which was called social sigh we did scientific surveying for
academics what we did was uh you would say you a psychologist and you need to
run a survey not only did we have the tools to create your survey but we also
had the participants that would take it uh we were in 4,000 different
universities I had an associate position at Harvard

00:15
and we had hundreds and hundreds of academic articles that used our software
and while I was doing that I got jealous I got really jealous dude is a
nerd I am a nerd I'll take I'll wear that proud uh I got really
jealous my Engineers that were on my team that were that were at my company
they could think of something and bring it into existence they had a supreme
superpower the idea the technology whatever they wanted they could chug a
Red Bull and get it done and so I pushed myself to learn the
code I wanted that superpower and I got pretty decent at it eventually uh after
interacting with General Assembly which is another big boot camp company they
asked me to start teing a class and then teaching a class and now I'm
distinguished faculty with General Assembly I've been teaching their

00:16
parttime time courses for almost 10 years now and about halfway in my journey at
GA I saw the power of what you could do at GA in 12 weeks we were giving people
those superpowers and about 5 years ago I wrapped up my company and I joined a
nonprofit called resilient coders so at resilient coders we started in
Boston Boston has the second largest Tech economy outside of Silicon Valley
yet when we looked in our communities of
color we saw double digigit unemployment
rates how do you have the second largest tech economy but communities that have
double digit unemployment rates it it makes no sense but there was a
disconnect the individuals that needed those jobs the most did not have the

00:17
skills yet to obtain those jobs and so that's what we do at RC RC is a 20 week
intensive boot camp for folks of color in the Boston Philadelphia and now
Pittsburgh area and in those 20 weeks they get the skills they need to command
amazing jobs in the last year 100% of our graduates have gone on to get
amazing opportunities we just sent eight people to Amazon in the last year we're
sending individuals to fangs to amazing top tier startups but what we're doing
is we're we're showing that there is a way to take these skills teach it to
those that need it the most and have their lives and their future change for
the better so when the pandemic hit I'm not a
doctor I'm not a nurse I can't gear up and go do something effective but I have
a skill that I think I'm somewhat decent

00:18
at and that's teaching people to code so I started 100 devs um 100 devs was made
so that folks that were hurting that were in the feeling the pandemic could
get those skills that I've seen change other folks lives and use it to change
their own now a year later 75 jobs doesn't sound too bad but it's not
100 this program is called 100 devs and I want 100 not 75 I want 100 so we're
doing it again and that's why you're here I didn't hit my goal yet so we're
doing it we're doing another round and there's one other thing I want
to while we're at this point of the story there's one other thing I want to get
to let's let's rewind a little bit back to when I was in
university uh when I was in university I get a little choked up when I tell a
story so bear with me when I was in university I moved off campus and there
came a time when I was hungry I didn't have money for food and I didn't have a

00:19
way of getting it quickly and what I did was realized you
know what I can make websites so I got my ass on Craigslist I made a
post and that same day someone responded they paid me a deposit like actual
monies a deposit and I skipped the skipped all the way to that grocery
store I skipped all the way there I was happy as could be got myself enough
pasta and pasta sauce to last me a small year and uh that that day changed my
life it changed my life in that moment I knew no matter how hard it

00:20
got no matter if I got fired I lost my job nothing mattered stay with me I had a
skill a skill that no one could ever take away from me a skill that would put
food on the table a skill that kept me fed and I want that I want that for
you I want that for you at the end of the day that's what I want for you
now there's a lot of you here which means that we got a lot of applications
that came through and I read them I'm not through them all there's a lot of
y'all a lot of people showed up today there's a lot of y'all but I read
them and the stories that you shared the the the things that you're

00:21
going through are real I see see you I hear you and I'm going to work my ass
off so that you feel the way that I feel about having that skill that's why I'm
here I want you to go home today knowing that if you put in the work you give me
those 30 weeks you won't just have a job you'll have a skill that is
yours that you can tap whenever you need it to get the things that you
need that's why we're here and it's not just me there are literally hundreds of
folks in this chat right now that have already done it that want you to be
successful there are thousands of us on Discord that want to help you get there

00:22
mentors that are giv giving up their nights and weekends alumni that are
giving up their mornings and Saturdays because they want you to have the same
thing that they unlocked we don't get got we go get
exactly Pam we don't get got we go get so I know it takes a little bit of
trust I know it takes a little bit of belief but you don't have to believe me
today you don't have to believe me on class on
Thursday but give me a couple classes and I think you'll start to believe that
what we're talking about is real heck you can go on our Discord and
go into our celebrations Channel and see
all the folks the jobs they got the real salaries that they
share the clients that they were able to
lock down you don't have to take my word for it but but if you're not there yet

00:23
that's okay I'm going to work hard to gain that trust and I realize that yes
the program is free you will never pay me a dime I
don't want your money there's nothing you can do to give me money all these
subs and donations they get donated to resilient coders and specifically that
goes into a fund or emergency fund for mental health support when folks need an
emergency doctor or medication or things
they can't afford that's what those that money goes
towards just because a program is free and money doesn't mean it's free in
time I know that a lot of you that are here right
now are giving up time with your family you're giving up time from the ones that
you love you're some of you right now are in the break room trying to hide as
you watch on the on your phone I a couple people wrote wrote out a about me

00:24
about that right it's not just money it's time and I won't take that time for
granted you give me that time you're going to walk away with
skills so yes program is free you'll never pay a dime you'll never be given
something that costs money uh that you have to do uh and I will respect that
investment of time that's my promise to you cool now hopefully you are here
because you want to be a software engineer the thing that we are focused
on is called Full stack web development software Engineers write code but you
can write code for lots of different things you can write code for your
mobile phone you can write code for robots you can write code for

00:25
refrigerators these days but we're focused on the code that's going to run
in your browser like Firefox or Chrome the things like when you think of a
website that's what we're here to learn software engineering is your profession
your specialty will be web development okay now A A lot of people are using the
the channel points and all that stuff don't worry we're going to get to all
that if if twitch can be overwhelming at first right twitch can be overwhelming
at first we're going to ease into everything okay we're going to ease into
everything I know it can get a little a little hectic a little hectic right
especially with so many people we're going to ease into it we're going to
explain things but don't feel like you have to have everything locked down
today that's not today's goal today's goal is to present the opportunity for
you to get a taste of what it's going to
be like in the classroom but things will come with time and if things don't make
sense that's all right you're going to come to Discord

00:26
and we're going to help you figure out all the things that you need to figure
out so on Discord we have lots of wonderful channels uh we have so many
folks there that have been tirelessly over the past couple weeks responding to
all your questions the as Leon channel has exploded uh in all the best possible
ways uh we're going to talk about all that but no there's a community to
support you and right now you don't need to have an understanding of everything
you don't have to understand what all these little bits and Bobs are doing
we'll get there with time 30 weeks is a significant chunk of time give yourself
a little bit of Grace and we're going to get there
together all right so going to go a little Leon
here all right tonight we're covering the basics and we're going to start off
by talking about software engineering as a

00:27
career then we're going to move into the course how it's structured the things
that'll be due what is expected all the things that you're going to need then we
will move into learning how to learn learning how to learn right it's the
most important thing you walk away from this course people were like Leon I
learned how to code no you learned how to learn you are all going to join jobs
that use a different stack different Tech technology then that we're going to
learn but the skill that you're going to have is the ability to pick up anything
quicker than your peers and that starts tonight that starts with you learning
really how to learn then we're going to move into
something called the client server model that's basically how the internet works
and then we're going to see a little bit
of code and get our toes dipped into the world of HTML just a little

00:28
bit you don't need anything tonight just to be here to join us to watch I'm
not going to ask you to write code tonight I'm not going to ask you to use
a text editor tonight uh you can just be here participate in chat and you'll be
good all right I always to start off with
questions before we always dive in each lecture I always start off with
questions and so I know there's a ton of questions so I'm going to take just one
or two right now because we're going to cover a lot of stuff tonight and I'm
sure he going to answer a lot of your questions do we get points for chatting
you get points for being here so when you're watching the stream you get
something called Channel points those Channel points can be redeemed for a lot
of stuff some silly some serious so the silly stuff will be like you keep
hearing those sounds that pop up uh eventually we'll turn back on like I I

00:29
have a vast collection of Pokemon cards for I think it was like 50,000 Channel
points you can get a Pokemon card sent to you so there are lots of things you
can do with those Channel points will there be smaller groups yes
there's a lot of you here right now that's too overwhelming for a lot of
people so we will over the next week or so be breaking up Discord into smaller
groups location Affinity things that will make it so you have your group of
people to bond with and go through this experience
together no Tech skills uh that's fine the expectation is that you have never
uh coded before that's the goal here and like I said tonight tonight
we're we're we're reveling in the uh the the wild this here but we'll turn on

00:30
slow mode uh and make sure that it it it seems a little bit more easy to
participate in uh as we kind of continue
on we need software uh the only software you're really going to need is a text
editor which we'll cover later on and a browser that's it those the only two
things you'll need for the entire 30 weeks cool all right there's going to be
lots of questions I always like to start off with a few but if you come on
Sunday all right on Sunday you are able to ask any question you want we spent
three hours last Sunday just answering questions right and so we will this
Sunday again have office hours you can come ask bunch of questions and it's

00:31
just a question answer session for the entire day that's it so we're going to
definitely come through uh on Sunday and
if you have lots of questions that's the time to come through and get those
answered all right now let's see if we can uh turn down the sub alerts real
quick uh I'm going to mute the sound alert just for now because I I know that
that has to be a little overwhelming there you go yeah so the sound alerts
are are muted for now I know tonight's the the first class and so people are
okay that didn't work obviously uh let's see if I turn them all the way
down I think that should work all right we'll see if that does it
um the idea here is that there's a lot of folks tonight a lot of folks are are

00:32
showing out splashing out it'll it'll chill down a little bit all right so
we're all here to be software engineers and there's good reason for why you
might want to be a software engineer these days right
now there is a gold rush of sorts that is
happening and everyone is flooding into this space of wanting to learn how to
code and that's okay there's plenty of room for us and we'll talk about that in
a second and the reason why it's becoming such a popular career choice is
because it has a very high pay right right now the average is 92k a
year it is what we would say is one of the happiest careers right did y'all
hear that sound did that still go off for you make

00:33
yep all right hold on one second let's see hm give one second
here sound alerts turned off one second here oh that was the
that's that was that my bad so that was sound alerts there give me one second
here folks and alerts properties all right here we go I turned
off the sound alerts but not the actual properties so let's go ahead one second

00:34
here all right so what we're going to do
is I'm going to turn down my alerts here there we go beautiful there we
go should be back we're good so now you won't be able to hear
the transitions or anything but for next class I'll have that figured out I know
it's just so many folks right now um so we'll do it that
way cool so we shouldn't hear any uh shouldn't hear any alerts now uh because
I've turned off the sound for everything
cool uh when I when I when I want to use my sounds I can bring it back
up we can hear the transitions all right well that that should be fine
then all right cool so we are good we don't hear the alerts we

00:35
hear the transitions beautiful all right so career in software
engineering reason why a lot of folks are looking to move into software
engineering right is the idea that it is a high paying job 92k average right now
for software engineers in the US and the other beautiful thing is that it
constantly shows up on the happiest careers list right so if you look at the
past five years right you look at the past five years every single year some
sort of software engineer some sort of software developer has shown up on that
list and then the other beautiful thing is that you don't need a degree to
become a software engineer so you're telling me that there is a high-paying
happy career that you can learn for free and you don't need a degree well

00:36
everyone should be running to it and a lot of folks are saying is the market
oversaturated hell no now it's oversaturated with folks that don't know
what they're doing we have a 100% placement rate in
my at my nonprofit during the day in terms of students that graduate our
program getting a job 100% we have more people trying to hire
our students than we have students double triple but here's what happened when
people found out that there was a high paying happy career that you can learn
for free didn't require degree that knew that right
now they could get into it we had a lot of these programs pop up and a lot of
these programs predicated that the only thing you needed to get a job was to

00:37
learn how to code well I'm here to tell you that learning to code is not the
thing that will get you a job what what did he just say I was here to
learn how to code learning to code let me get big
here just so people people don't get lost here learning to code
will not get you the job it's a small portion of
it it's a small portion of it but it's not the only
thing what if I told you because this is true half the
folks half the folks that got a job from 100 devs this last cohort half of

00:38
them did not have a technical interview let me say it again half of the
folks that got jobs did not have a technical
interview so a coding boot camp that just teaches you how to code is leading
you astray people were like what how he found the right place
so when it comes to getting a job coding is definitely something
that's going to help you is definitely something that will
come up in a significant number of your interviews but the
networking the building a rapport with the individuals that have open jobs and

00:39
application the way that you apply to jobs has more impact these days than
just your raw coding ability so we're going to spend a lot of
time on things that aren't just learning how to
code this boot camp is going to teach you more than that because that's not
the only thing that contributes to you getting a job now the other wild thing
that happened is when this industry propped up when people realized that you
could have a high-paying happy career that you could learn for free with no
degree well a lot of boot camps popped up that spit out generic just generic
coders there are whole crops of boot campers that have the

00:40
exact the exact like line by line projects in their
portfolios like you could see whole like if you go look at boot camps you could
see whole groups of individuals that graduated that did not have a singular
line of code that was different so no wonder people are saying
oh it must be saturated or or or there's too many no there's a bunch of people
that have no idea what they're doing that have all the same projects that
have all the exact same experience that haven't tell their resume that haven't
put any work into networking that haven't made connections in the industry
and they smell they smell they walk in the
room they can't even get in the room how you going to hate from outside the club

00:41
you can't even get in they can't get in because they smell there's a stench a
recruiter spend 6 seconds looking at your resume and they know it's all
cap they know you can't code there's there's there's nothing there's
nothing on your resume in your experience on your LinkedIn that would lead
that would lead to you actually being successful on the job and so right
now there's a window that's open there is a window that is open
where you can learn to code learn how the network learn the things that you need
to differentiate yourself in the market where you can get a high-paying happy

00:42
career that you can learn for free with no
degree but I have no idea how long that window will be open right now the window
is open for a couple of reasons a lot of folks say Leon why aren't like CS grads
taking all these jobs well when you go to a four-year University you are very
lucky if you have two classes that teach web
development like that's like the best program I've ever heard
of right you're going to spend more time on compilers and CS Theory and all this
stuff that nobody wants to pay you for they want you to build web applications
and you at best probably got one class of that in

00:43
University so so at 100 devs we teach the practical skills the things you
actually need to get a job and then I task you once you're getting paid to
learn the theory to go get the dusty ass books and
learn the theory but here we learn the Practical stuff the stuff that people
actually want to pay you to do and then once you get the job you fill in the
gaps don't do it the other way that's one of the reasons why this window is open
the other reason why this window is open is because right now you can learn one
language that does it all you can learn JavaScript use that on
the front end you can use that on the back end you can use it to do everything
you need for your job and you only have to learn one
thing if you go to a 4-year CS program you probably never learned that

00:44
language like what how is there one language that you can use across the
whole stack and this language it makes me mad I get angry I'm sorry I'm getting
I'm getting angry this language is literally the most in demand
language let's get big it is the most in demand language and you're not teaching
it that's why the windows open that's why the windows open there
are a lot of folks in the market that don't have practical skills that don't
have anything that shows to an employer that they know actually how to code and
they haven't put in the work to build their Network so they can actually get
into the interview for the job that's the biggest that's the hardest thing the

00:45
hardest thing is actually getting the interview you go on
Reddit right you go on Reddit and you'll read poost I apply to 500 jobs and I
haven't heard anything 500 jobs and I haven't heard anything and I and I just
sit there and I'm like if you applied the 500 jobs and nobody got back to
you it's because you up you didn't do it right you smell you
smell your portfolio is busted your resume is busted you don't have anything

00:46
that shows to him employer that you actually know how to code you got
got and you just clicked apply never ever ever just click
apply if you ever just click apply it's the same thing
it's the same thing as you printing out your
resume and lighting it on fire actually no you just clicking apply is worse than
you burning your resume let me tell you why because if you printed out your
resume and lit it on fire there is a small chance that that piece of paper
lit your curtains on fire your house caught on fire thankfully the sprinkler

00:47
put out the fire right house didn't burn down thankfully but the fire department
still had to come when the fire department came there was somebody on
that like the fireman was like in your room and they saw that you had vs code
like your text editor open and they go oh wow you know how to code my brother's
cousin's Uncle works at this company downtown and they've been looking for an
engineer for the past two months and they haven't gotten like how about I I'm
sorry that your your curtain's caught on fire why don't I connect you so maybe
you can get a job that is more likely to happen and get you a job than you
getting a job just by clicking apply so there's a window that's open

00:48
there's a window that's open right now where you can get a high-paying job that
is the happiest job like five years running that will provide for yourself
and your family that right now there is a
practical way for you to compete against individuals coming out of fouryear Cs
programs where there's a practical way for you to learn the things that are
actually in demand that companies actually want and if you do it right you
can get a job now you're saying Leon it sounds great right sounds
great but why doesn't everyone do it why doesn't everyone do
it well here's the reason why not everyone does it learning to

00:49
code and putting in all the other work that it takes to get the
job takes a really long time we call this the Troth of
Sorrow many of folks have endeavored to become software engineers and many of
them have failed trying to cross the trough of
Sorrow here's where a lot of you are right now you want to see where you're
at right now now a lot of you are like right here you're on Udi
Hill right you keep buying those UD Demi courses
you're you swipe that credit card like ah boom you throw in the credit card at
the at the at the screen you're like oh look at me now just bought a Java course
ah just bought a JavaScript course ah like python course ah
right you never finished one you bought a bunch of

00:50
them but you definitely didn't finish one if you got if you got more than
three UD Demi courses that you've never actually even started in your account
right now just just give me a thumbs up in chat you can just you can just put up
you can put up or thumb you if you got at least three that you've never even
started put up I got to put up too we did this during office hours I'm guilty
I got it too boom there you go I put my own
up so we got to stop and we got to ask ourselves why do we keep buying all these
courses that we're never going to do and haven't gotten us closer to our
goal and there's two big reasons the first reason is it's very

00:51
easy to spend money and feel like you've done something right it's a very low
cognitive effort thing that makes you feel like you're taking a good step
toward your goals all right so a lot of people will
over and over again spend money right getting got because it feels good they
feel like you're working towards progress right the other reason why
people do this is because some YouTube told them
to some YouTuber told you that you needed to buy the course to get the
job some YouTuber told you that if you didn't spend that money you weren't
going to get the Fang job somebody told you that you could get
a Fang job from their course and unfortunately you got guys

00:52
that's okay around here we don't get got we go get so you found the right
place people are saying what's Fang Fang is like the big top tier companies
talking about Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google
right if you come to me you say Leon I want to go work at a Fang I don't know
how to code I've never coded in my life but I want to work at
Fang don't let me be the way the person that gets in the way of your dreams
but let me tell you a little bit of what that sounds like that sounds like to me
you know you know Uncle Uncle Ray Ray that like comes around every once in a
while and they tell you that story about how they almost played for the Yankees
that's what it kind of sounds like they never played baseball a day in their
life but they come and they tell you that they're going to play for the
Yankees right it's the same thing as you coming to me and saying Leon I I me and
my dad toss the football around I'm going to go try cry out for the

00:53
Eagles okay there there is a small chance that you will transition
from never having thrown a football to going and playing for the
Eagles don't don't let me get in the way of that
dream but I'm here to be a little bit more realistic I'm here to help you get a
job and I want you to keep your sights lasered focused on the
pleora the thousands of jobs that are so
much more easy to get into than shooting for the Eagles or the
Yankees we can all go play in our wreck league and that's what I'm talking about
I want you to all join a wreck League company I want you to get paid good
money be happy have time for the ones that you

00:54
love and for your hobbies and I want you to be able to do that within 30
weeks so I'm not going to sell you on a dream I'll leave that to the YouTuber
you love to watch I'm going to sell you on something that's realistic that you
can accomplish that you can get done and then once you are getting
paid once you are getting paid you got that that cheddar coming
in then study your ass off and go get that Fang job and I'll be there to
support you I sent 10 people to Fang very recently but let's get paid
first all right so let's get back to this trough of Sorrow all of you are
kind of like right here right now and to make it through the trough of
Sorrow you got to do a lot of stuff you got to go through the
muck very quickly probably today if not tomorrow or Thursday you're going to

00:55
find yourself kind of plummeting down UD Demi
Hill and then you're going to have 20 weeks of being in the
muck and after those 20 weeks of in the muck you're going to start to have some
Wiggles of false hope these Wiggles of false hope is when
people like start responding to your emails for jobs or when you get that
first really big interview this is going to happen to most of you
you're going to get a really great interview at a company that you'd be
really excited to join and you're going to go into the
interview and it's not going to work out
that's just the truth that's the Wiggles of false
hope we tell individuals that they have to apply to 60 companies
60 and we know already that we don't just click apply these these are 60

00:56
companies that we have networked our way into where we're talking to a living
breathing human being at those companies that's what I mean by 60
companies that we applied to about 10 of those interviews are going to go
horrendously wrong like slap their mama throw up all over them bad
about 40 of them are going to go so so and about 10 of them are going to go
amazing like could not have gone better you did everything the it just went well
your best friend you're you're going to their summer house the next weekend like
just amazingly well and out of that you'll get two offers step back here for a
second right you're you're going to go through the muck of learning how to code

00:57
and then you're setting up for 60 real applications not just clicking
apply all right so that's why people don't go through it it's it's daunting
it can be anxiety inducing but remember what I said
earlier today is not the day you don't have to have all this figured out we're
going to give you the tools the techniques the tricks the things that
you need to make it through this trough of sorrow and on the days that it feels
the worst you have a community to fall back
on community is the only way I've ever seen folks truly make it through the
trough of sorrow and after today you might say Leon sounds great this isn't the

00:58
community for me and that's okay that's okay but you need to find one you need
to find one that's going to help you get
unstuck when late at night things aren't going well and you've been racking your
brain you should stop and go to sleep by
the way but you're going to need someone some group of people that can help you
get unstuck what we've been able to do in the last cohort is build an amazing
Community folks that are going to help you get through the muck through that
trough of sorrow and come out the other end and there's a lot of folks here
right now that are new but they want to help to when you learn
something you're going to teach it to those around you and in a week from now
when there's something that you don't know guess what there's going to be

00:59
someone else to help you everyone needs to know right now that
there is a cost to this program Leon you're like there's no cost this it's
free it's no money yes you'll never pay me
money but here's the real cost of this program when you graduate when you get
that job the expectation is that you turn around and you bring three more with
you that's it that's the real cost you're going to get there you're
going to turn around you're going to bring three more with you and I don't
mean I don't mean a lazy half ass bring three with you I mean you're busting
your ass to answer people's questions you're giving them
time I put a thousand hours into this cohort last cohort a thousand think
about that 300 plus of them were just live another 300 preparing and getting

01:00
everything going and then at least over 100 maybe 400 500 of 10one
time there are so many people in this chat right now that I've spent hours on
the phone with where I've picked up the phone to
talk to an employer to to Hype them up to say they're the best person I've ever
interacted with so the real cost here is that when you get the job you
make it to the other side we go back to the trasar when you make it to the
promised land you turn around and bring three more that means you're going to
hold that window open a little bit longer you're going to make sure your
people make it through you're going to make sure that
they know what they're walking into when
they go into that interview you're going to make sure that they're

01:01
prepared you're going to make sure that the people that helped you
along the way you're there to help when it's time so if you're not
ready for that type of cost just Just Close Your Eyes just take
out the headphones it's okay you can leave it's fine this community is a
community I don't know how else to say that any better you're signing up for a
community a community that wants to help each other support each other and when
they make it to the promised land turn around and bring more with them you
can't say I didn't warn you you can't say I didn't tell you I'm making it very
clear that that's the cost of this program and if that's not something
you're willing to sign up for that's okay close your eyes like click exit you're

01:02
good now there are three other things that are the real core things that help
people be successful in this journey like without these three things you're
not making it to the promised land you're not getting through the trough of
Sorrow I've been teaching people to code for 10 years I've taught thousands upon
thousands people to code I've helped hundreds get jobs and I've picked up
three key things that help folks make it through the trough of sorrow and I'm
going to tell you about them when we come back from our
break because around here we like to be healthy we like to make sure we take
breaks at the top of the hour becoming a software engineer is a marathon not a
Sprint we have to be doing stuff that that enables us to remain healthy and be

01:03
able to get through these 30 weeks so if you are able I'm going to bring up a
timer if you're able I want you to get up and leave the
screen I want you for five minutes to take an actual break to let your fingers
relax to hydrate to go and look out the window let your eyes focus on something
that's not the screen and then we'll be back in
five okay so you're going to take those uh five minutes and when we come back
from the five minutes I got to say thank
you to a lot of folks uh thank you Greco
for the 10 gifted Subs there have been a lot of people that have been in here
dropping Subs uh I don't want to break up class to say thank you to everyone
but I will do that when we come back from break so take five minutes and
we'll keep going after the five starting now

01:04

01:06
and uh I'm going to take my break too be right back y'all
what's going on everybody I won't I won't go into any more like slides or
anything we'll just chill going on everybody you're a twitch new that's all
right it'll get easier we'll spend time we got a long time
together you're excited for what's to come me
too what's your over watch main Arisa right
now mayor service it keeps cutting out that's all right the vods will be
available uh as soon as class is over any vets there are a lot of
veterans in this cohort uh we're going to have a special channel for y'all um
definitely something I'm super interested in supporting lots of amazing
programs out there for veterans uh I taught a vets and Tech cohort at GA
which is uh vet and Tech is the the person that started Craigslist created a

01:07
support group for for veterans and funs courses and stuff it's pretty
cool how do you do your hair that's always like the biggest we're going to
we we're going to do a whole class just on my hair
prep OGX products shea moisture kind of it you have 1.4 micro Leons hey there we
go is class every day no it's every Tuesday and Thursday at 6:30 p.m. eastern
time don't worry Jay how about the beard I take way less care of my beard than I
should definitely gets dried out too much uh do I need Twitter yes we're
going to talk about that when we come back we we got we got to get into the
actual course and how it's going to be set up but we're going to go over all

01:08
that stuff so don't worry how is attendance I haven't looked whoa
okay we ain't outside but we live let's go 7K all right yeah we go for about
three hours are the cats in the background yours no they're not mine just a
gift we outside let's go are you married yes I have a wonderful
wife top so far was 7,300 that's wild what can we do to stay motivated oh
that's a good question it's about discipline not motivation we'll talk
about that don't worry all right folks come on back come on

01:09
back hope you had a good break make this a little bit smaller
come on back folks hope you're able to rest a little bit hydrate a little
bit had a lot of folks in here earlier with the the subs I just appreciate
everyone for that uh let's go ahead and chill the music here a little bit so
folks know to come back uh we had diece solution with 20 gifted Subs Danny
Thompson in the house with the 15 gifted subs thank you so much for being here
deep fried penguin with the 10 have to figure out another way to say
thank you to everyone because it's it's it's a lot I'll get better at it this is
this has been this has been uh the most people we've definitely ever had in chat
so I promise I'll get better at as we go through and like I said um never ever
feel like you have to do that that's that all goes to the nonprofit I work at
during the day do I know Spanish I know a little bit and I have been very much

01:10
like taking lessons so I have like a tutor I've been meeting like twice a
week with my Tor I'm trying to get way better at it my wife speaks
Spanish cool all right folks let's get into this
again all righty so talked about Community being the goal but I promised
you that there were three things three things that my students
that I've noticed over the years are are very good at uh that helps them right
that helps them get through the trough of Storrow to learning how to code all
right and those three things are managing frustration being consistent
and taking care of yourself now when I used to teach classes in meat space
right where like students actually had to come into the classroom you remember
those days that's wild uh students actually had to come into the classroom
students would come in they would sit down and within like the first few

01:11
minutes I knew whether or not they were going to be
successful shrimp said repeat that I got
you shrimp I got you I said back when we used to meet in person right people
would come they would sit down and literally within 10 minutes I knew if
they were going to be successful or not and I can tell you how I knew they were
going to be successful it was how how they dealt with
frustration there are two types of individuals that are going to be on this
journey there going to be some types of individuals that sit down to learn how
to code and think that learning how to code or their lack of coding ability is
a reflection of their intelligence their
IQ all these things which are absolutely not true your ability to code is a
reflection of your ability to put in hard work to sit reading Dusty

01:12
documentation for hours on end to struggle and fail over and over and over
again and then ultimately come out the other side of the trough of Sorrow it
has nothing to do with where you started
I have seen folks from all walks of life I've had individuals that have been
returning citizens and hadn't touched the keyboard in five years the folks
that were caregivers it this does not matter learning to code is not about raw
intelligence or IQ definitely those things can help but it's more about how
you deal with frustration there was a very famous
study that came out not too long ago that looked at when did individuals lose
their ability to be fluent in a language and for a while folks thought
that they lost their ability to become fluent in a language like in the teens

01:13
like early teenage years and what they found out was people don't really lose
the ability to become fluent in a language they just get
older and when you get older you lose the ability to manage your frustration
because when you're a kid and someone says go do this thing go study you do
it right you do it right neuroplasticity
is thing it is it is but what this study showed is that it's it's more this
idea that you could eventually become fluent in the
language but you are now in charge of your own life you decide when you go to
bed you decide when you wake up you decide what to eat and when we start
doing that our ability to get more frustrated is is present and that

01:14
frustration is what stops you from learning and so there is a
mindset that my most successful students have if you're ask me like who's the
most successful the most successful students
I've had are the individuals that say you know
what whatever Leon said today I did not get and you know what the stuff that
Leon said yesterday I didn't get that either and the stuff a week ago is still
not clicking but I know tomorrow's my day tomorrow this stuff will make sense
tomorrow I will have figured it out and I will keep working until it
does two different kinds of people and it comes down to you managing your
frustration ADHD gang in the house uh so for those that don't know uh I have

01:15
bipolar disorder and I also have very severe attention issues uh that leads to
the next topic here consistency when I first started to
learn how to code I had a very severe problem with
consistency consistency is hands down the biggest factor in your ability to
learn how to code and retain it going into the future and let me tell you
why a lot of folks come to me and they say hey Leon I want to learn how to code
I'm going to study 10 hours a day they come to me they say Leon I'm
going to study 10 hours a day no you're not you've never done that
before you've never studied that much before and even if you did it wouldn't

01:16
be good studying so that's a lie and what I'm here to tell you is
that you don't need to do 10 hours a day you just need to be consistent every
day so class is about six hours a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays and then
outside of class you should expect to spend about
10 10 to 14 hours depending on how well the week goes and the folks that mess up
or the folks that say I'm going to spend 10 hours on Saturday
studying why do you think studying for 10 hours on Saturday is a bad
idea what do y'all think they burn out exactly it's the
weekend I got to do now we outside you know like can't be spent our

01:17
weekend's doing that you're all goofy all silly it's because you can't it's too
hard but here's the real thing maybe some people can study those 10 hours but
next Saturday is actually the baby shower and then two Saturdays from that
it's the the parents are coming to town and so you skip that one
Saturday and then after you skip that one Saturday you're behind and then once
you're behind you just stop right so instead of chunking huge
hours on time spans that you're probably not going to hit we want to spread out
our learning through a period every day and be consistent in that learning every
day one to two hours a day is plenty to get a job within the 30-week time span
all right and that consistency every day actually has a

01:18
scientific mechanism that we're going to
explore in a few minutes right so if you want to learn how to code you got to
learn to manage your frustration which is something you can do it's something
you can practice something you can exercise you have to be consistent
you're committing to studying every day not just one day a week one to two hours
and I know that's a big ass for a lot of folks for some folks that's a huge ass
you got life you got responsibilities you got things you got to do and so I
respect the hell out of folks that can figure out those one to two hours a
day and then the last thing that I've seen on this list of three things that
have helped my students be successful is the ability to take care of

01:19
yourself most folks burn out that's it most folks lose that endurance to keep
going they start off trying to do 10 hours a day and then within two weeks
they're too tired they start off trying to do 10
hours a day and within a week their fingers hurt their arms like literally
hurt you are way better off getting that one to two hours
in right getting that one to two hours in and then
sleeping eating right exercising a little bit I'm a big boy but getting
that exercise in just a little bit I'm not talking about like going to the gym
I'm talking about walking you got to make sure your brain
is healthy if you want to learn this skill do you all know like if you if
like chess Grand Master when they're in tournaments how many calories do you

01:20
think a professional chess player Burns just by playing chess in a
tournament how many calories do you think oh people already know people read
the article or they've been around here for a little
while professional chess players burn 6,000 calories in a tournament 6,000
calories in a tournament and they're sitting there moving pieces around it's
because that cognitive effort I had to look this I looked this up right before
class because I didn't believe it either because I I've been I threw it out like
I got to be correct it's 6,000 calories that cognitive effort has a
real toll on your body so if you've managed your frustration you set up your
life in a way that you can be consistent and to set up your life in a way to be
consistent you might have to talk to your partner you might have to talk to your
family as Dr Eric Thomas said you called me but you called me at the wrong time

01:21
right you might have to put things into different places so that you can be
consistent and then if you manage to have that privilege of the time to
actually study don't waste it by burning out and not taking care of yourself
learning to code is a marathon not a Sprint Princess Sparkle bomb said I believe
that I haven't done School in a decade and this class is wearing me out it will
and so we got to be healthy we have to know that we're going to take our time
and we're going to ease into things but most
important is I've I'm going to lay out what I think is the best path for you to
learn how to code the path that has helped hundreds of my students get jobs
the path that I've have seen work for folks time and time again that's helped

01:22
them to not burn out to actually finally learn this and to get the soft skills
they need to get a job and I'm going to ask for a little bit of trust and a
little bit of patience there's a lot of you here way more than we would have
expected we're going to figure it out right but if for some reason the
path I'm laying out is not the path for you if it's not the path that makes
sense for you that's okay don't let your dreams be dreams don't let some random
dude on the internet stop you from doing what you want to do and accomplishing
what you want to accomplish just do it do it just do it just do it so just
do it make your dreams come true just it all right so let's talk about the

01:23
course we're doing we're doing this motion for the course right we're doing
this motion for the course everything with time all right you don't have to
come in knowing how every little thing works you don't have to come in with any
coding experience we're going to get there together and we're going to take
our time we're going to ease in over these first three weeks none of this
stuff is a hard requir M until we are 3 weeks in so I'm about to say some stuff
that I I'm going to ask you to do but none of that's a hard requirement until
we make it right until we make it three three three weeks in okay till we make
it three weeks in we're going to we're going to go slow we're going to take our
time okay now the materials that you need for
class right materials for your class are always going to be on Discord uh if if
you're not in our Discord you can do exclamation point

01:24
Discord and every day we have a channel called the follow along materials
channel in that follow along materials Channel you will find everything that
you need for the day there will be the slides that I'm using right now there
will be the link to check in there will be uh
motivational poems uh things that are going to help you get through the class
so if you're not on Discord right you want to make sure that
you are and that's just Leon the.com Discord or you can explation point
Discord and it'll take you there all right cool
now every class I am going to share a tweet if you want to be in touring and
Hopper which we'll talk more about if you want to be in either of those houses

01:25
liking and retweeting that tweet is mandatory for everyone else I would love
if you did it but not mandatory uh I asked you to do this for a few reasons
one I want more people to find out about our community to find out that they
don't have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to learn how to code and that
tweet helps more people find us and see what we're doing and want to join okay
now the other reason why I want you to get used to checking in and using
Twitter is because it's going to be one of the biggest Tools in our Arsenal to
get a job okay I told you that learning to code isn't
enough it's the networking that's going to be one of the biggest impactors on
you getting a job Twitter is by and far the best tool to network with other

01:26
Engineers okay so yes I'm asking you to do it as a requirement of the program
but I'm also just trying to get you to find other people on Twitter to work
with to interact with to network with so that you can get the job that you want
cool another requirement of the course is that you network each and every
week you are going to network with three individuals that are already in Tech
meaning that you're going to reach out to them you're going to connect with
them at least three each week now a lot of you might be freaking out be like Le
I have no idea how to network right I have no idea how to to
network I have no idea how to interact with people you might be saying I am the

01:27
most introvert of introvert right that's okay we're going to have
full classes on how to do this appropriately and we're going to find
ways that work for everyone uh whether you're the most extroverted or the most
introverted we're going to find a way for you to network and build up those
connections of individuals that going to help you get a job right
because at the end of the day at the end of the day it is not rly
your coding ability but the individuals that you've connected with are going to
help you lock down these jobs remember if you just click apply you might as
well light your resume on fire I'm going to
also ask you right I'm also going to ask you to have two coffee chats each week
which is where you sit down with someone and have a longer form conversation

01:28
about their experience in Tech right how do they get to where they are what are
the things that they're learning right now what are the things they're doing
right and like I said right now we're easing in everything none of these are
requirements until week three and we're going to have full classes on how to do
this all right but if you want to know how people consistently get bigger
and better jobs it's because they put time in doing
this that's it they know how to code but the real differentiator is their
Network there will be homework all right after each class you'll have some
homework that homework will always be due a week later so tonight you have
some reading and some watching to do and that reading and watching will be
due next Tuesday so the stuff I assigned tonight the stuff that's already on

01:29
Discord will be due right will be due a week later on
Tuesday at first you'll be submitting stuff through Google forms and then once
we get further into the course and we feel more comfortable with things like
the terminal we'll be using GitHub to submit all of our projects and all of our
homework all right cool can't find the Discord channel it's
the follow along materials Channel cool there's no like specialized channel
for it it's just the follow along materials channel is where it'll be
listed cool we do not start with GitHub GitHub is confusing as so is the
terminal so is G all those things are just not stuff you need to start off

01:30
with like the ease into things we're going to start actually from zero right
if you if you are starting from zero you've probably never used the terminal
we're not going to start there just doesn't make sense we're going to ease into
it eventually once we have a command of JavaScript I'm going to ask you to do a
coding challenge every single day every single day that's right no
weekends every single day not yet though not yet not until we get to
JavaScript but you're starting to see how folks have been successful in this
program hopefully hopefully the the the the the the it's becoming a little bit
more clear why folks were able to get jobs right right he said Leon I came
here to learn how to code but I didn't know it was going to look like this I

01:31
didn't know that you're going to be asking me to spend six hours in
class be consistent studying at least one to two hours a day networking with
three individuals each week having two coffee chats each week doing a coding
challenge every single day homework on top of all of that right
now we go back back to the trough of Sorrow you are officially at the
peak the peak is for those that have gone up the hill they've
mustered up the courage right to to come and say I want to learn how to
code all right they've mustered up the courage they've got into the top of the
hill and they looked over and when they looked over they
saw a lot of material that they had to work through they saw that they had to

01:32
be checking in they saw that they had be doing networking each week three
individuals two coffee chats they saw they'd be submitting homework they saw
they'd be doing a coding challenge every single day in preparation for getting
that job and when they looked over that Hill they had a choice here are your two
choices right right the first choice is you can go down that Hill screaming
screaming crying for your mama or you can be
Beyonce that's my options for you right now if you are
here you can go down this hill screaming and crying for your mama or you can be
Beyonce Beyonce's having fun they realize it's going to be a

01:33
journey they're going to be ups and downs and they're all equally
exhilarating you are going to feel lows that you may not have felt in a long
time where things feel really dark nothing makes sense things aren't
clicking it sounds like brish is coming out of my mouth but I promise you that
right after that dip is an exhilarating ride
up and so you're going to give me 30 weeks and some of you are going to go
through these 30 weeks screaming and crying for your mom that's okay I ain't
here to judge and some of you are going to go through this like Beyonce you're
going to have fun you're going to enjoy the process
process you're going to make lots of friends and you're going to give your

01:34
all each and every day knowing because you've managed your frustration that I
may not know it today I might not have known it yesterday but I'm going to get
it tomorrow be beyon oh no I gotta fix I always hit the end and then that
happens all right we've chosen to be Beyonce hopefully
a big question that I keep seeing coming up in in uh in chat and people ask me a
lot is Leon is there a syllabus no there's no syllabus we are
learning full stack JavaScript you will learn HTML CSS JavaScript node react and
mongodb now like Leon why no syllabus why are you not giving me the full
outline of the course I'm going to tell you why because if I give you the full
outline of the course a couple things happen one there's some research that

01:35
came out of Harvard that shows that people drop at the chapter end so
basically once the chapter's over that gives you permission to stop I don't
want that to happen to you the other reason why is because a lot of you don't
know it yet but you're code weenies I'm a code weenie too it's
okay what that means is is if I gave you
the full syllabus you're going to charge ahead you're going to do every single
thing that's on that list you're going to be putting in 10hour days and a month
from now you're burnt out and we never hear from you again so to save you from
yourself to save you from yourself there's no
syllabus if you're like Leon I hate that
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard fine all my stuff is on YouTube bye
trust the process I've been doing this for 10 years helped hundreds of folks

01:36
get jobs taught thousands of people to code it'd be really silly really silly
for me to put a thousand hours into a course and not do something that takes
me 10 minutes there's a reason behind it cool all right if
you are joining you are agreeing to our rules we've built a phenomenal
Community we've helped dozens of folks get
jobs and I'm proudest that folks can get help when they need it and the folks
that give their all to this community and so I am protective of this
community folks that are wilding in chat I see you I'm coming coming for you I'm
coming for you you're going to be banned
I'm going to go through this chat with a fine tooth comb and I'm banning all

01:37
y'all I'm going to love every second of it right so if you want to join this
community you're agreeing to our rules when you join our Discord you agree to
some rules I'm going to read them again because I want you to be very clear what
these rules are all right so the quick the quick rundown
and this is specifically here and on Discord uh no non-safe for work stuff
especially on the Discord we're here to learn how to code no one's here to find
the love of their life we're here to learn how to code and get phenomenal
jobs no illegal discussion this includes hacking piracy stuff like that you want
to sell the seven C's on your own that's okay don't do it it here on
Discord uh no ban evading if you switch your IP stuff like that we're going to
find it anyway you're just making more work for us but we're going to ban you

01:38
anyway no discrimination be very clear on this this includes using racist terms
slang sexist or ableist terms making others feel bad for their race gender
sexuality or disability if you can't be a good human
being get the out this isn't for you if you can't be a decent kind caring
person leave please just do us all a favor because eventually you're going to
get banned anyway just leave right now please you're you're doing myself and
our moderators a huge service by just leaving now
cool no advertising don't spam stuff here in chat don't spam stuff on Discord
um so on our Discord don't post your YouTube your Twitch your other discords

01:39
uh your social media we have a self-promo channel that that stuff can
go in um but specifically this includes private study groups and other things
that split the community right I'm not putting a thousand hours into this
cohort right for folks to run a muck and ruin it for
others we keep our spaces moderated for a reason if you try to lead people to
another space that is not moderated by our amazing team of volunteer moderators
that's a problem because we've had that problem where folks break off a little
bit they still try to be involved but  goes sideways and we can't be there
to moderate so if you're sharing other communities on our Discord you're
sharing other private study groups it's just a ban we we want to make sure that
the community stays together that we're able to protect everyone that we're able

01:40
to create a safe learning environment and we can't do that
cool don't ignore your warnings or mutes we're nice people we're going to warn
you we're probably going to kick you if you do something weird um but we're
going to tell you why and then one thing that I really
want you to take the heart right there some other stuff here no abuse no toxic
Behavior no spam um but there's one thing I want you to really live by if
you're going to be a part of this community
please before you type anything or say anything in our Discord voice channels
ask yourself one very important thing is that the
nicest kindest thing right that you could type in that moment that you can
say in that moment let me say it again let me get big here real

01:41
quick before you type anything on Discord before you type anything in this
chat is that the nicest kindest thing that you could say in that
moment if it is not don't say it or get the out I don't understand why this
is such a hard problem for a lot of people but it is this is some of you are
in this in this in this right here with us right now and this will be the
hardest thing you've ever done in your life but if you want to be a part of
this community that's the cost before you type anything before you
say anything in our voice channels is that the kindest most
helpful thing that you could do in that moment if it is not don't do it and if
you do do it bye-bye we didn't bust our asses over

01:42
the past year to build a wonderful Community for that not to
continue cool be a decent person I got it exactly myself and our moderators are
going to hold you to it now tech for a lot of folks is not not a welcoming
space there are going to be a lot of Gatekeepers there going to be a lot of
people that tell you no we don't need that in our own
Community we don't need that coming from our own
people you are going to be ahead of someone at some point in this cohort and
you're going to be behind someone at some point in this cohort we all have
bad days we all have responsibilities outside of

01:43
learning that's okay when somebody asks a question don't be a jerk answer their
question and do it with kindness when someone misses something in
class right when someone misses something in class don't make fun of
them for missing something in class if they don't understand something make
sure they understand it if you can't agree to be the type of
person that puts helping others and being kind above everything else this is
not the community for you go to stack Overflow find some other Discord
group and you're like Le you spend a lot of time on this yes damn right I'm
spending a lot of time on this very specific
point we have a wonderful community in our Discord That Grew by 10 ,000 people

01:44
in a week I refuse to have that Community change
into something that it is not I will go through and delete all of y'all I'll
just I'll just go back I'll go back 10 days cut it all and bye-bye like it just
just gone I'll delete every single one of y'all I don't care because what we
built is special it does not exist anywhere else online
it just doesn't I've been around the block I've tried to learn a lot of
languages and I've have been met with hate I've been met with disrespect I've
been met with people that don't give a  that's not us that's not a 100
devs that's not learn with Lon and if you can't get that through your brain
and commit to it get the out I'm going to give you a second I'm going to

01:45
stop talking I'm put the music on go ahead go
please put the music on I'm giving him a second hold on sometimes it's hard some
people just close their eyes they forget they got to click the button it's it's
the it's the little X you click that and you're gone
cool you're all here so we're agreeing we're agreeing to these rules we're
agreeing to be kind and positive first we're agreeing to to to see the best in
each other um my executive director at resilient coders has a
brilliant line like a few lines I'm just going to read them because they're
they're brilliant and it's the thing I want you to keep in your brain and the
thing that they always tell our students

01:46
and I'm going to tell you right now this is Dell for the folks that know be kind
to one another be the type of person who stays positive and gives people the
benefit of the doubt see the best in people Embrace diversity of backgrounds
of perspective of things we can choose and those that we can't accept your own
failures and those of your peers as an important part of the process exactly be
Beyonce all right now I've said it I'm going to keep saying this if you don't
like what I'm saying right now like go like it's going to keep coming up
because I refuse to build a community that's just like everything else in Tech

01:47
that's not us all right we've laid the groundwork here we've laid the groundwork
here let's get into learning how to learn now a lot of
folks don't make it through that trough of Sorrow not through any fault of their
own they don't make it through the trough of Sorrow because they might not
have ever really learned how to learn you're already putting the wise in
chat right they might not have actually ever really learned how to learn the
things we're about to talk about are just absolutely criminal to me that they
are not taught in every school every University
these things are the things that are going to help you get through these next
30 weeks and so just real quick to lay lay some groundw work
here you're already doing it this is hilarious have you

01:48
ever reread a chapter multiple times while you're trying to learn something
if just reread a chapter multiple times type yes everybody did wise too too
early type yes I want I want some effort here give me a full yes if you've ever
reread a chapter multiple times while trying to learn something I love the
first time viewer if come on you got to get interactive with you're not going to
make it these 30 weeks if you're not typing in chat if you have the means
to all right next question have you ever taken copious notes like you wrote
a lot of notes as you were trying to learn something give me a yes in
chat have you been taking notes tonight put a yes in chat we haven't really
gotten to any content yet if you have you taken

01:49
some have you ever highlighted like you wrote all those notes and you spent a
lot of time like highlighting and going through them highlighting them can't
tell you how many highlighters I went through all right let me blow your mind
here for a second all of those things rereading taking notes and highlighting
they do nothing nothing thing to help you
learn like Liam that's what I've always done I've always taken lots of notes and
highlighted my ass off and reread bazillion times doesn't
work it wasn't you seventh grade English
class it wasn't you you just didn't know how to study you're like wait a minute
Excuse me yes they don't work about to tell you why they don't work and I'm
going to show you what does work okay what if

01:50
there were two strategies I can give you two strategies right now what if there
were two strategies that enabled you to learn stuff faster more
efficiently and forever the rereading the highlighting and taking notes that
ain't it but there are two things you can do that we're going to learn right
now that are going to help you to learn stuff faster more efficiently and
forever and those two things are active recall and spaced repetition now you're
going to have two videos to listen to for homework that go way deeper into
these two topics because they are so important literally when I teach this is
the first thing I don't care what topic I am teaching I don't care where I'm
teaching at these are the first two things I'm telling you I teach at the

01:51
Harvard Business School maybe like once every year twice a year and at Harvard
Business School I open with these two things because it is criminal that we
are never taught these things it it is absolutely wild that I made it through
my entire educational Journey without knowing these two
things all right active recall here's a chart this comes from Ali abdal they
have an amazing video that's actually your homework that walks through a
process called active recall all active recall is is when you are done reading
something you recall the things that you just
read now I have attention issues here's a here is a very common thing that
happens because I have attention issues I will read through a chapter and it's
as though I like teleported it's like I'm at the end of the chapter and I'm

01:52
like what just happened cuz for the past five minutes I've been flipping pages I
definitely my my eyes have been moving but I have no idea what I just read
right it took me until like 10 years ago like adulthood to know that like other
people did that and it's because we never were taught actually how to read
appropriately when it comes to studying so if your mind's blown let me tell you
what helps actively recalling when you get to the end of a paragraph
stop and recall to yourself what you just learned if you have attention issues
you're going to be stopping more frequently in the beginning if you don't
some folks can get to the end of like a page or some folks can even get to the
end of the chapter but the idea is when you're done learning something new you

01:53
talk to yourself say it out loud the things you just learned uh you all saw
Bob during the break me and Bob have whole last
conversations right where I am telling them all about the stuff I'm learning
all about the weird things that are going on in my code and if Bob has his
headphones on as he does right now I talk to my duck it's chroma out so you
can't really see it but I have a duck that I talk
to Bob was The Mannequin that was sitting on my chair when I left I talked
to my duck some days me and Bob were on the outs and I talk to my duck when I am
learning something new I stop every like chunk of text like every paragraph of
text I stop and I say to my duck what I just learned and and at the end I recall
everything I learned in that chapter and here's why here's why there

01:54
was a study that was done where they gave a group of students four different
groups of students one chapter of I think it was like a biology textbook I
forget I doll will bring it up in the video one chapter let's say of a biology
textbook to read one group read it once so here is
the group that read the chapter once here's the group that read the
chapter four times four times here is the group that read it and then did like
a spider map like they did some other things that like got them like actively
into learning and then here is the group that read it
once and recalled the things that they just learned
now let's say this one more time let me let let me let me let let me let me let

01:55
me just let me let me just bring this down a little bit here this group read it
four times they read the chapter four times this group read it once and did
better if you're not mad right now you should
be this group read it four freaking times this group read it once and then
just talked out loud to themselves about what they just learned and they did
better I don't know which one of my teachers

01:56
want to step up but somebody's catching hands how how can there be a
way how can there be a way where you do a fourth of the work but do better
that's active recall right that's what active recall can do a fourth of the
work but still do better so you bet after you learn something at a 100 devs
the thing you should be doing is recalling when you are done class
tonight when this stream ends we do a raid but when when that raid is

01:57
done right when that raid is done you need to stop and
recall the things that you just learned right now something that people
do is they like to take notes here's how I twist
notes we'll talk about the rate at the end don't worry about it for right now
here's how we do notes don't take notes take questions don't take notes take
questions as you're learning something write down a question right what is a
study practice that can enable me to do a quarter of the work but get better
results because at the end of class right at the end of class you go
back through your question s and your questions are your active

01:58
recall so don't take notes who has that emote the the Great British Bake Off
emote it was hilarious take questions and then at the end of your lecture quiz
yourself by going through your questions cool that's active Recall
now the sad thing is if you put in the work even to actively
recall we have something called the forgetting
curve right we have the forgetting curve let me take a sip here thank you thank
you uh Memphis we have something called the forgetting
curve now this was a study of one so it's like not the best research uh but
it is a something that's been repeated and you can actually see it within
yourself as well what this person did is every day they would

01:59
memorize a thre digigit like a threel combo like three just three letters and
then they would quiz themselves right they would quiz themselves 20 minutes
after an hour after at all the way down to 31 days after and what they
found is that that threel combination within 20
minutes there was like a 40% chance they forgot it let's say that
again let's say that again with just in 20
minutes there is like a 40% chance that whoop in one ear out the other
so if you are trying to learn how to code guess what software engineering is a
cumulative career meaning that you have to remember the stuff that you've done

02:00
in the past so you can build upon it and build up your knowledge over
time even if you put in all the work you do all your active recall by the end of
31 days there's like an 80% chance exactly poof gone
gone you learned it you forgot it and you're gone right and
so a lot of people put a lot of time into these tutorials they put a lot of
time into learning how to code only for two months later to remember a damn
thing I can't tell you how many tutorials I've done that just a few
weeks later I would would have to restart the whole
tutorial and that contributes to being in the trough of Sorrow cuz people just
don't realize that one they were taking notes the whole time they were

02:01
highlighting their asses off I can't tell you how many notebooks I have full
of stuff that I took notes on and highlighted that I will never ever
remember so active recall helps you learn the material but we know as humans
we have this forgetting curve and when we come back from break I'm going to
teach you or show you how you can never forget anything that we learn together
or anything that you learn in the future forever there's a very simple tool that
you can put into place that will enable you to reap the benefits of your hard
work and not forget the code that you learn so we're at the top of the hour
and as you know we like to be healthy around here we take a break at the top

02:02
of every hour it's a marathon not a Sprint we're going to take care of
ourselves and so let me pull up the timer here please if you are
able get up get away from your chair walk around if you're
able grab some water hydrate do some light stretching let your eyes focus on
something right let your eyes focus on something that's not your
screen because we're in this for the long haul all right we start the timer
here we put on the tunes and I will see you all in five minutes because I'm

02:03
going to take a break too I'll give you Bob so you're not lonely TN five

02:05
folks we don't get got we go get yo not back yet going to chill until the
timer's over what are mini Leons for you can use
your channel points to unlock a bunch of
stuff from like silly stuff that happens during stream or eventually uh like
getting resume reviews and stuff like that was that a Manu scarf
yep proo thank you for the hydration cheers to you what's my favorite Pokemon

02:06
typing um grass cuz I like Bulbasaur I don't know it's not the competitive
answer but it's still my favorite leech seed all the fun stuff that comes along
with it I don't know what the starters are going to be in the Legends
Charmander Psyduck was the best Abra was
the best in in Pokemon Blue just cuz you could if you got Alakazam or whatever
the way to get Al gazam was like it was over it was a wrap Leaf blade
exactly favorite anime Attack on Titan I'm I'm I'm not like deep in the
anime though actually I'm going to say cowboy bbop cuz I'm an old
head what's the blue circle for I just didn't take it off
do you play OverWatch with your students
quite a few yeah we have a game together Channel definitely down to play some

02:07
OverWatch or some fun stuff favorite superhero
Batman did I get the Pearl Diamond remake of
course I play Apex I played it once or twice but never really got into
it favorite video game definitely Pokemon I like Pokemon X and Y I think
I'm a little weird in that regards but that was the only gen where you really
felt like you were like a real trainer cuz you could go from like meeting
someone in game to them being on your like friends list with video like with
sry not video with voice chat so like really felt like you were actually a
Pokemon trainer that could play with folks from anywhere around the world and
then they got scared of voice chat in Pokemon games probably for good reason
and got rid of it all right folks come on come on back
come on back hope you had a good break hope you're able to stretch relax a

02:08
little bit grab some water let's get this all right so we before we took our
break we talked about this idea of active recall being the thing that
actually helps you learn right like that the idea of actively recalling the
things that you just learned is the tool to use as you are learning material and
we talked about probably not taking notes but taking questions so that at
the end of the night or at the end of your studying session you can go back
and recall the things that you just learned all right now the forgetting
curve is the devil at play here because even if you do your active
recall let me chill the music here even if you do your active recall there's a

02:09
good chance that you forget the material right you forget the material
and so I promise you when we came back to tell you how to flatten or get rid of
this forgetting curve and the way that we get rid of the forgetting curve or we
flatten it is with repetition okay now what happens the very first time that we
learn something right the very first time we learn something by the end of
three days there's a nonzero chance that we've forgotten it right like we we
we've gotten to like a 40% chance that we've just like forgotten it right but
if we were to review that material right just
once we push our 60% memory retention ention from 3 days to S let's think
about this if you just reviewed your material right if you just reviewed your

02:10
material once you flattened your forgetting curve by a whole
week if you were to review it three times right that flattens out the
forgetting curve even further and with enough with enough
repetition Nick hey what's going on thank you with enough with enough
repetition with enough repetition that forgetting curve becomes flat and we
just don't forget stuff we just don't forget stuff right
and so if you're going to come here and you're going to put in all the work
you're going to put in all the hours all right Bu The Rock song coming on right
if you're going to put in the work you're going to put in the hours you're
going to put in all this time to learn stuff you owe it to yourself to do the

02:11
strategy that's going to make sure you don't forget
it briefcase said well what constitutes reviewing we're going to use a tool
called space repetition I got you what space repetition means is that
we are going to space out our repetition what that means is we're going to see
the same material over and over again right the same things that we learned
we're going to make sure we see them in some formulaic algorithmic way we're
going to see them over and over again and just by that idea of repetition we
make sure we don't forget stuff right so here is on a scale of like if you're
going to remember it or not right on a scale if you're going to remember or not
if you just learn something once right there's a a good chance that
you just forget it if you recall that information once
look at this just literally recalling once look at what your percentage jumps

02:12
to you jump over 20% just by recalling once that means if
you took questions during our lecture and after lecture right after
lecture you just review the things that we learned earned your retention jumps
20% one one one one recall 20% so that's why active recall
works you just do it once you got like 20% more chance of remembering something
and then if you repeat it multiple times your ability to remember things goes up
and up and up and up and up and up and up and up now here's the really

02:13
interesting thing here is space repetition and here is repetition in
Mass this repetition in mass is when you
take Saturday to study over and over and over
again so that that's the people that want to put 10 10 hours in on a on a
Saturday right where you just sit there all Saturday repeating stuff
right it literally look look here is I swear is this lower hold on how is that
possible how is that right here is you you repeating a bunch of times in one
session versus recalling once right so so this makes sense this makes sense let
me let me explain here and Ali abdal is going to explain it way better than I
can right in in a full video for you but here's the idea let's say I learned

02:14
something and in that same session right in that same session I repeat it to
myself a 100 times I'm not going to say 100 but let's say I repeat to myself a
bunch of times so there's no recalling it's just that one session I just do it
a bunch of times right that is worse than learning something and then
recalling it once at a later time right and then here is if you space out your
repetition so you can see how significantly important it is to space
out your repetition and not just have a day where you study you have to do this
every single day here's the science you don't take my
word for it Ali abdal is the the the master of this and they're going to
guide you through it through these two videos that I've shared now you're
saying Leon space repetition sounds amazing I can flatten my forgetting

02:15
curve never forget something how the heck do I do that well we do it with
anky anky is a free tool anky is flash cards with an algorithm behind them
that's all it is it's flash cards with an algorithm behind them if you've ever
used flash cards great you were getting some recall in but it wasn't good enough
because there's no algorithm behind it what anky does is it does the space
repetition for you you review a card and then if you get the answer right it's
going to show you that card in two days if you get it right again it's going to
show it to you in a week to get it right again it's going to show you in a month
I have some cards that I won't see until I'm like 7 years old right because once
you review the material enough your forgetting curve is flat you just won't

02:16
forget that stuff anymore all right so we're going to use anky anky is
completely free do not pay money for anky remember I'm never going to give
you anything that you have to pay for it is completely free on Windows Mac OS
Linux G new Linux uh it it's completely free on Android and in on the web if you
have IOS the app is $25 do not pay for the IOS app just use your web
browser right you can use the anky web which I have conveniently linked for you
right here you can do all the stuff in the
browser I I create all my cards on Mac OS and I review them on an Android
phone right I highly recommend that you only create your cards in one location
and then you review them wherever you want but if you're like Leon that sounds

02:17
amazing wonderful we're going to have a whole kind of like class on how to use
anky better right but as the co-work goes on and we're starting to actually
learn more and more material an is going to become your best friend anky is
something that you're going to use every single day all right so I got two
questions for you I just gave you the cheat codes to learning right active
recall space repetition I don't know why it's not on the front page of every
textbook but this is how you actually learn things so now I'm going to ask you
a very important question why should you create your own anky cards and not use
someone else's throw it in chat give me some ideas
here why should you create your own cards and not use someone else's
exactly the simple Act of creating your own cards is an active recall

02:18
session so by creating your own cards you get a full repetition of active
recall in and it's going to be the things that you actually learn that
you're recalling that that cognitive effort that you put into learn pays off
when you use your own cards this is also why you should never use
somebody else's notes or somebody else's questions if you're using somebody
else's notes or questions you didn't get your own active recall in and it's
something you have to get better at remember software engineering is a
cumulative career it's something you're going to be doing for the rest of your
working days and so you have to get good at using these tools and strategies you
are all going to leave this program and join a company and on day one they are
going to use a tool and a technology that we have not learned together and
you're going to have to learn it on your own so you better be good at creating

02:19
your own anky cards taking your own questions getting your active recall in
feeling comfortable with space repetition because you're going to have
to do this every single day for the rest of your
life cool next question question for you
I can see why tutorials can be a trapped exactly tutorials are a trap because a
lot of times it's low cognitive effort reading highlighting notet taking all
low cognitive effort when we do low cognitive effort tasks the the
connections in our brain don't form the same way when we do high effort tasks
active recall space repetition are these high effort tasks that actually Force
the Connections in your brain to solidify cool next question for

02:20
you why should you use anky every day high effort exactly it's spaced
repetition every day right it's space repetition and exactly
consistency right we said the three things that I noticed in my students
that were successful were they manag their frustration they were consistent
right they were consistent and they took
care of themselves well using anky every day builds that consistency it makes
sure your forgetting curve is flattened it makes sure you don't forget the
things that you did it's high cognitive effort you're forming those connections
in your brain and it works it just works so if you're here and you're saying to
yourself Leon I was never successful at learning how to code
before but you didn't use active recall and you didn't use space repetition

02:21
that's why the folks that do active recall and space repetition and take care of
themselves they learn how to code a lot of people say Leon I was never
successful in school because you didn't know how to learn they don't teach this
I wasn't good at math because you didn't know how to
learn now you do you're going to put it into practice and I guarantee you if
you've ever said those things to yourself before things change once you
start putting these two things into practice said how long is class uh 3
hours we always go 3 hours get your refunds folks
FKS if he went to University he didn't teach
this all right now the fun stuff is that there are some other tools and

02:22
techniques that are going to be really helpful as well these are the big ones
like if you just do these two you're good life changed you'll learn and not
forget stuff heck you could be like Leon I hate you your voice sounds annoying
I'm going to leave that's okay make sure you do these two things with your next
tutorial cuz you're going to actually learn more just do that please that's
all I ask of you this is where you stop with us cool make sure you use these two
things going forwards now the beautiful thing is that there are other tools and
tips and tricks that are going to help you be successful as well and so your
first big set of homework is to go through Dr Barbara Oakley's course
called learning how to learn uh they have broken down all the science behind
how adult and specifically adults learn and they're going to give you all the
tips and strategies you need to continue we've covered the two big ones but that

02:23
course is going to give you the rest now like I said a lot of folks come to
learning how to code with all these preconceptions about how they
learn there are no visual Learners there are no uh kinesthetic I
got to touch things learners it's all made up it's not real it really it just
it's not a real thing it's the things we
tell ourselves to get over the fact that
we don't have good study habits and it's not our fault we never learn this stuff
right it's not true you can look it up don't take my word for it look it up
you're like L I've been a visual learner my whole life no you got got that's
something somebody told you 10 years ago when you were struggling in school to
make you feel better but it's not true you need real study habits active
recall spaced repetition are real study tips that are going to help you learn

02:24
the things that you learn cool deep breath everybody I no this a
lot especially if you haven't been in a learning environment for a while three
hours can be a bit but uh I appreciate you and I thank you for putting in the
cognitive effort for put putting in the active recall for putting in the space
repetition and for being here right now I can't tell you and you can see
them how many folks out there want to learn how to code in the new
year right how many folks want to learn how to code in the new year but how many
of them are not going to put in the high cognitive effort tasks they're going to
keep buying courses they're going to keep taking they're going to do all
these things that are not going to actually help them to learn so now you
know what you got to do it's hard it's not easy but if you decide to give up
your nights or your weekends or time away from the ones that you love I

02:25
respect the H out of you and let's get it we're going to get the bag all
right got a little bit more than a half an hour a little more than a half
hour and we're going to start off by learning what the heck the internet is
and then hopefully just a smidge of HTML I don't think we're going to go over
tonight I think we'll be able to hit exactly the three hours um but we're
going to this will be the first thing that we learn
now I kind of mentioned this at the beginning but I just want to be really
clear before we get into like the big topic we're going to learn
tonight this is a jobs program I know it says like free coding boot camp free
software engineering program but this this is a jobs program the idea is for
you to get a job okay that that's the goal we're we're covering way more than

02:26
just coding to help you get the job and what I really want to click is that for
a lot of folks learning the code can be a lot of
things I'm a I grew up loving puzzles you give me a hard challenge I'm about
it I'm going to do it I'm going to have fun with it I'm going to love it so for
some folks coding can be a way of like getting daily challenges that they work
through for some folks they love to code because it could be creative you can
bring things to life it's like playing Minecraft on like super energy pills
right you can you can think something and build it and people around the world
can play with it and enjoy it and then for some folks it's about making
money I started off my story telling you
you the reason I did this and the reason I got into it is to get the money
there's no shame in that make your money that's why I'm here

02:27
and that's why I think a lot of you are here too I hope that in the process of
making that money you start to enjoy the things that you're doing as well right
you start to see the beauty and how the internet works you start to see the
beauty in HTML you start to see the creative side where you can build things
but let's not front and pretend that that's why most of us are here
cool I'm a bag Chaser me too all right so you all hear to be software Engineers
but the focus of this boot camp is web development
remember we said a software engineer could write code that works in a lot of
different places the code that we're going to write works in the browser like
Chrome Firefox Safari the things that you would normally use to like access

02:28
websites and web applications that's what we're here to learn how to build we
will be software Engineers we're going to have software engineering
fundamentals we're going to know our data structures our algorithms we're
going to know our tooling and support we're going to know a little bit of math
behind all that stuff and our focus our specialty will be full stack web
development so a lot of have you signed up for becoming full stack web
developers without maybe knowing what a full stack web developer really does
we're going to solve that today that's what we're going to get into now before
we jump into it what the heck is the web or the
internet let's let's let's separate the web from the internet there's actually
two different things what's the internet
you're all here to become web developers
to build things that exist on top of the internet what the heck is the internet
and participation in this class you can say whatever the heck you want you could
say Beyonce's Network yes you could say Beyonce's Network and that counts you

02:29
could say cats that counts cat videos that counts I want every single person
that's still awake that's still here to throw into chat what the heck they think
the internet is I want to see a bunch of like firsttime typers this is your
chance wires I love wires networking computers I love it an
addiction yes Community yes memes yes the Matrix yes come on give it to me
information yes man I can tell a lot of people watched
like like early 2000s NBC the information Super
Highway all right I see a lot of people saying a wire uh it means that you
probably snuck ahead and watched my video uh but yeah we're going to start
off with that idea of a wire so let me go to whiteboard here let's start off

02:30
with an idea of a wire now on this wire we're going to have two different
kinds of computers we're going to have client side
devices and we're going to have servers cool so we're going to have a
wire and we're going to have two different kinds of computers on this
wire now client side devices are the computers that we use to consume things
that go across the internet so client side devices might be like your phone
your laptop a tablet a desktop whatever you're using to consume
that content is your client side device whatever you're using to watch me right
now that's a client side device fold said what's with all the

02:31
nuns all right I'll I'll explain what the nuns are the nuns are an emote that
you get on this channel uh you can get emotes from subbing or from just using
your channel points because you never need anything you never need to sub for
anything like it just doesn't do anything um but the nuns are an emote
that we have because well my mom was the best uh my
mom always found free stuff for me to do all the time and uh it didn't matter
what it was if there was a raffle if there was something we got it all right
and so I remember I got to go to Six Flags I got to ride I think it was
called the Medusa like eight times in a row two hours before the the Six Flags
opened up because my mom filled out a form at Wendy's and we won well my mom
found out that that there was a free art class every Saturday morning run by
nuns and so uh every Saturday guess where I got dropped off to hang out with

02:32
the nuns and learn how to draw so my drawing as you can see is not that great
so you can't blame me you got to blame the nuns go to Philly find you some nuns
and say why can't Leon draw better it's not me it's them so that's where the
nuns come from all right we got two different kinds devices
julo I love that name jundo thank you for the five gifted
Subs uh we we have two different kinds of devices on this wire that is the
internet client side devices that we use to consume and then other types of
computers out there on this wire called a server
now take a wild guess as to why we call this computer a server
why do we call it a server what do you think that computer does on the
internet it serves exactly it's called a server because it

02:33
serves and what it does is it serves up different kinds of content a server will
serve up a bunch of different things HTML SS JavaScript these are all languages
that we're going to learn together but when we are on our client side
device we can make requests those requests leave our client
side devices and find themselves all the way at a
server that server can hear that request and respond with something that is the
backbone of the internet this idea that we have some devices that can make
requests and some that can respond with stuff now let's step back a

02:34
second Rob thank you for the hydration let's step back a
second if I asked you to open a Word document what program would you use
right what program would you use to open a Word document
not trying to trick you here yeah you probably use like Microsoft Word right
you might have another program that opens it but like Microsoft Word right
what if I asked you and throw this in chat what if I had a PDF what program
could you use to open a PDF Adobe maybe preview if you're on a
Mac right but Adobe right so we have this idea that like we have these
programs that can run on our client side devices and these programs are really
good at opening certain types of files word can open Word documents

02:35
Adobe can open up PDFs well running on our client side devices we often have a
program called a browser and that browser is really good
and when I say browser I mean like Firefox Chrome Internet Explorer these
browsers are really good at opening certain types of files specifically HTML
CSS and JavaScript files they can open those files and display what you are
seeing on your screen right so often what we will do is
we will be on our client side devices we
will be using a program called a browser and from this browser we are able to
make requests to a server that server is just another

02:36
computer out there on the internet that can hear that request and has some code
that tells it what to do right I like to think of this as like a
restaurant right the client side is like you sitting at your table
and the back end or the server is like the kitchen from your table you can make
requests to the kitchen and the kitchen will send you back
food right you don't really care too much about what's happening in the
kitchen you really kind of just care that they give you the food well this is
the exact same thing that's happening on the internet you are sitting in the in
the in the booth making requests on your
client side the device those requests go to some server or kitchen and you get
stuff back now the beautiful thing is that our client side devices our

02:37
desktops our phones our tablets all have that program called a browser and the
browser can run the files that are being
sent back from the server so when we get food back from the kitchen we are able
to eat it but maybe there are some things that we couldn't eat well a
server could work the same way a server could send you a file that the browser
has no idea what to do with and it just wouldn't know what to do and it wouldn't
run it but when we send to the browser HTML CSS JavaScript it knows what to do
with that stuff cool now let's do an example let's
pretend that we are going to order from dominoes uh I love using this example
because I am actually no longer allowed to order food from Domino's so we are
going to pretend uh my wife is just across the hall from me like they're on

02:38
the other side of this wall I ain't trying to get got uh so we're going to
pretend okay we're going to pretend that we're going to order food from
Domino's everyone's saying why I'll tell you why all right here's why I a grown
man am no longer allowed to order dominoes when when you are walking down
the street and the Domino's delivery person pulls their like they're driving
past you they pull over they get out their car they walk up to you they say
hey Leon how's it going they grip you up
and they're not delivering you pizza and you're with your wife that is the exact
moment you are no longer allowed to order food from dominoes so we're going
to pretend I'm going to pretend on my I'm not even going typeing in my phone
I'm afraid it's all right I'm okay to be
scared um I'm going to pretend that from my client side device I am going to go

02:39
to dominoes.com so I type dominoes.com into my client side device that request
leaves my phone that request leaves my phone makes
it all the way to Domino server and Domino
server Domino is like wait a minute wait a minute was that
Leon is that Leon did Leon just order something from
dominoes did we get him back is he in the house the all return to order
dominoes and they're they're throwing up their kids are going to college
everything's good in the world we're going to we're going to
we're going to pretend we're going to pretend so I've typed in dominoes.com
pretending into my phone that pretend request is made to Domino's server they
go wild and then they go hm what should we respond with well they're going to

02:40
respond with HTML CSS and JavaScript they're actual individual files right
they're actual individual files but each of those files handle something
different so once the response comes back to my phone I see do website in its
full Glory if you if you've never been to Domino's and I haven't been there in
a while I haven't been there in a while right but back in the day when you went
to Domino's website there was a beautiful picture of a pizza at the top
and going down the middle going down the middle was a list of
ingredients all of that content that you saw like the picture the text
that was all powered by HTML no snitches exactly tiny that was

02:41
all HTML so if you've ever been to a website and you saw content your client
side device just consumed HTML freely on so if you've ever been to a website
and you saw like text or images that was HTML now
Domino's website was beautiful back in the day the ham was pink the pineapple
was yellow the peppers were green the ingredients were like centered so like
that color that positioning that style that was all powered by
CSS so if you've ever gone to a website and you saw content that was HTML you
ever been to a website and it didn't look like a hot dump dumpster fire that
was CSS and then the kudagra the the the the the the the end of all

02:42
websites was that on Domino's website you could drag the ingredients on to the
pizza [Music] you could drag the ingredients onto the
pizza and that was all powered by JavaScript so if you ever went to a
website and you saw content that was HTML if it ever looked good and not like
a hot dumpster file that was CSS and if you could ever do things like drag and
drop interact that was all JavaScript now now that's all stuff that's

02:43
happening on our client side but somebody honestly that was hilarious uh but
that's all happening on the client side like we're seeing all that stuff on our
device but there's a lot of stuff that has to happen on that server on that
server there's a lot of things that have to happen right they got to be able to
process our credit card they got to be able to look up my
2,000 orders right they got to be able to store the new orders into a database
right keeping track of all the orders that somebody's ever made so there's a
lot of stuff that has to happen on the server that's set up so that we can
handle the requests that are coming in right when they when I make that request
to die dominoes the server needs to process my credit card it needs to send
my order to the local dominoes it needs to store my order in a database all this

02:44
stuff that we never see is happening server
side right so you are all here to become full stack web
developers what that really means is that you will be able to write code that
runs on the client side like the HTML the CSS the JavaScript and you will be
able to write code that runs on the server things that enable you to process
credit cards store stuff to a database hear those requests for pizzas coming in
right and we actually have words for that folks that just focus on what the user
sees right are client side developers or frontend developers folks that focus on
just the server side are called backend developers and individuals that do both

02:45
the front end and the back end we call them full stack
developers now a lot of people come to me saying Leon I just want to be a
front- end developer or Le I just want to be a backend developer if you've
never built a full stack web application you honestly don't know what you prefer
yet some people think that like the front end might be more
creative or that they that the back in might be more mathy no it's not they're
they're very different things but give yourself a chance don't close yourself
off CU you might like one more than the other but here's the
thing you got to know both at least the basics you can't be a front-end
developer that that doesn't know how the code you're writing interacts with the
backend that's how you lose your job right people feel like they're going to
go into just the one specialty no you got to know the full

02:46
stack right you got to know the full stack and you're going to know the
basics and then once you know the basics
you've built a full project from scratch then you make those decisions because
you all every single one of you here will have built a 100 hours project a
project that you put 100 hours into you've built the front end and the back
end and then you can stop and say all right well maybe I like this or that or
maybe both so come in with an open mind all right now I said that this whole
thing is about sending requests and getting responses from our client side
device we made a request for dominoes.com that request found its way
to the server and then a response found its way back and the way that this all
works is that those requests are actually going across real wires let me
show you those real wires here we go you got got to look behind my

02:47
drawings here are the wires here are the transatlantic internet cables uh
there're these big ass wires that go across the ocean that enable our
requests to move around the world inside each of these big wires I've been told
is that there are eight fiber wires in between in each one and each one of
those fiber wires can transmit up to 53 terabytes per second now I have never
downloaded a an illegal Blu-ray rip like who does that right but if you had you
would know that like a good quality Blu-ray around 3 GB so we're talking
about the entire Blu-ray collection going across just one of those wires per
second there's eight of them in this tube and then look at all these cables
everywhere in the world right they're just everywhere so that's how our

02:48
requests are actually moving around the world and the funny thing is these
requests only have 3 seconds to go from the client to the server and back if it
takes more than 3 seconds people bounce that's that's the professional term for
this it's called Bounce rate like how many people just leave right now it
seems simple at first but there are a lot of things in between our requests
from our phone or our computer all the way to Domino server and
back typically if you're like on your laptop or your desktop you are maybe
connected on WiFi and the Wi-Fi is you're going to you're going to make
a request from your device it's going to go from your Wi-Fi to your router
through your modem and one of the first places and give me some leeway with all
this like you could spend your whole career on just like one portion of this

02:49
right and this is kind of an overview so give me a little bit of leeway here but
one of the first places your request is going to go is an
ISP what's an ISP throw it in chat what's an ISP anybody know
somebody said is that where network engineering comes in it can be the start
of it yeah it's an internet service provider these are the individuals that
we pay money to to connect us to those big old wires right
now I'm not a fan of the isps I'm really not they charge a lot of
money but I kind of get why those big cables that I showed you they're not
really ran by like the big folks that we're thinking of like Verizon Comcast
those are more like government other really big service providers maybe some
of them right what Comcast and Verizon and all these other isps are really good

02:50
at or what we call Last Mile they're really good at connecting your house to
those big pipes right and there was an article not too long ago about when
Verizon came into Boston they laid fiber may I want to take a guess what the
article said it cost them per block to lay fiber how much you think it cost
them per block take a guess five million a
block five million a block so I kind of get it I don't like paying the money but
I kind of get why they charge so much it's a lot to lay that last mile cable
and connect us to those wires cool Next Step that our request will probably go
through is something called a DNS anybody know what a DNS

02:51
is yeah domain name server or system depending on you're talking to but let's
say domain name server a DNS is just another computer out there on this wire
and the computer is really good at doing
one thing it's a really fancy phone book
hold that in your head for a second it's
a really fancy phone book all right if I was throwing a party and I asked you to
show up at my back porch please don't show up my back
porch please don't do it it's not an invitation but if I was having a party
and I wanted you to show up to my back porch what could I
do what could I give you that would enable you to get to my back porch
a lot of people are saying an address would an address get you to exactly my
back porch get you close it's not going to get you exactly to my back

02:52
porch coordinates exactly I could give you the GPS the longitude and the
latitude right to my back porch and with that you could get exactly there the
same thing happening on the internet we typed in Domino's.
that wasn't enough to find that server we needed something called an IP address
an IP address is kind of like the latitude and longitude to get you to
that server so remember I said DNS was a fancy phone book all that's really in
that phone book is an address and the IP address right because when I'm giving
you the directions to my back porch I could say go to 37111 491
912 comma -42 1.14 11119 like that's the coordinates to my back porch right like

02:53
I could give you those coordinates will you ever remember the
coordinates to the back porch there you got them right no you
will never remember those coordinates and there's no way in hell you remember
the coordinates for a bunch of other people so instead of latitude latitude
and longitude and us having to remember all of those things we have addresses 32
Cherry Street right they're very easy we
can remember 32 Cherry Street instead of the latitude and longitude you're all
like I got anky now I got it give me the
latitude longitude right and so the idea here is that we in the real world have
addresses to get around and on the internet internet we have the same thing
but instead of addresses we have URLs dominoes.com well dominoes.com is the
address it is not the latitude and longitude to that server so we need a

02:54
DNS when we give them address dominoes.com the URL it gives us the IP
address here's the IP address for Domino's 139772 4421 01
that's not Domino's IP address I'm not that I'm not that bad come on now give
me give me a little bit more respect than that all right but the idea here is
that it's it's something like that where we would type in dominoes.com our
request goes through the ISP if we paid the money then it goes to our DNS and
then the DNS would give us that IP address and with that IP address we
could eventually make it to our server there are lots of other steps in between
this is just an overview that server has some code running on it right that code
hears that request comes in and knows what to do maybe it's going to fetch
some HTML CSS in JavaScript maybe it's going to store an order but that code
listens to the request and knows what to

02:55
do and then once it's finished with that request it sends a response and that
response goes all the way back to the client side but guess what that response
is going back through all these hoops right got through all these hoops right
that we just jumped through to get to the server and this all works because of a
very important tool right a very important tool called
https HTTP there we go we'll say HTTP right we have HTTP all this works
because of the hypertext trans trans ER protocol it is the way that we were able
to make these requests and send these responses right hypertex transfer
protocol actually sits on top of some other stuff

02:56
PCP IP there's a bunch of other stuff that like is happening to make this work
but the idea of being able to send a request from a client and get a response
from a server is because we're sending all this through this protocol
now something fundamentally changed about the web a while back something
that changed this whole game for the better kind of gave it up already what
changed about HTTP that made all this better the S exactly we got
https or hypertext transfer protocol secured what used to
happen is every single request you made went through this entire chain this
entire network across all those cables and every single person in between the
hundreds of people in between they all got to see what you were requesting and

02:57
the response you were getting back let that sink in for a
second back in the day not me not my friends not people I knew but back in
the day people would go to Starbucks and they would run a program called fire
sheet and when they ran that program called
fire sheep it would show them all the requests that were being made on that
Network so you could see all the sites they were signing into all the passwords
all that stuff before we had the S once we got the S things got
encrypted the funny thing though is that you can still see what's being
requested and you can still see a lot of information about that user you can see
where that user is coming from you can see what type of computer they're on and
you can see the site that they're requesting like the
URL and so something really interesting happened with the isps is that the

02:58
isps w a court case that said hey not only can we record all this stuff like
the site you're going to uh the the computer that you're on not only can we
record all this stuff we can sell it to the highest
bidder right and so all your isps are doing that now because they have like
the legal authority to do it all right so all the requests that you're making
are going through this entire network uh and everyone can see them cool
now who uses an incognito browser great Incognito browser really
doesn't do anything it does one very specific thing I'm about to show you the
only thing in Incognito browser does you ready about to show you the only thing
an incognito browser does you ready for this pay attention ready 3 2 1 that's
the only thing that an incognito browser saves you

02:59
from did you see what I did hold on let me let me slow down right you ready boom
that's what it just saved me from right if I had used an incognito browser the
things that I looked for right the the the things that I searched for in the
past aren't like stored locally on my machine right
but does it mean that the websites I'm going to nobody can figure out like my
ISP still knows that balloon website that Everyone likes to go to right like
my ISP still knows uh what computer I was on when I
went to those sites right and so you you got to be careful folks all the
Incognito browser does is just so that if your your your loved ones sit down
and they want to practice their Pomodoro they don't get
surprised okay now a lot of you are looking at some stuff that you don't
want other folks to know right you don't

03:00
want your ISP to see you don't want your
DNS to see you don't want all the people in between to see that website you love
going to so much and so there is a way to protect yourself and it is a
VPN a VPN stands for a virtual private Network it is somebody else's computer
that you send your encrypted traffic to and then that computer makes the request
on your behalf so you run a program on your computer that encrypts your traffic
it goes completely encrypted through your ISP through the DNS to this
computer where that computer decrypts it and then makes the request on your
behalf now PE vpn's love VPN because they think it makes the them more secure
um but here's the thing uh VPN is only secure in the sense that you trust that
provider more than you trust your ISP right let's say that

03:01
again a VPN only works if you trust that provider more than you trust your ISP
there are ways to roll your your own vpns and stuff like that but that that's
all it does so even if you're using a VPN you're still trusting somebody else
to not log your searches to not log all the things that you're
doing so if you want to buy your drugs and guns online please don't do that
just through a VPN there are other ways we'll save that for another class
though save that for another class some folks are saying tour the onion Network
yes there there are things like the onion Network where instead of it just
being a request and a response to a server you you got to bounce your
request around to dozens of other computers each time it's peeling off a
layer of the onion until it makes it to where it needs to go and then it bounc
through all those relays again but please if you um are trying to buy your

03:02
drugs and guns online don't just use a VPN all right now if you've hung around
this long you now know more about the internet than
99.999% of people on this Earth and I need you to go into the world and do
good with it so I'm going to KN you all hold on real
quick you are all newly KN at developers of the web go on and do well with this
information you now know how your request leave your client side devices
and make it to the server you now know that your ISP and the DNS are in between
listening for it you now know that a VPN can protect you if you trust your VPN
more than you trust your ISP you know there might be other things like tour
that can keep you a little more more safer you understand that your requests
are going across these wires using a protocol called HTTP and at the end of
the day the way the internet works is by sending requests from a client and

03:03
getting responses from a server over these 30 weeks I'm going to teach you
how to write the code that runs on the client side devices the code that runs
on the servers and everything else you need to get a job as a software engineer
that focuses in full stack web development cool all
right where we at we're a little over we're a little over give me uh give me
five five more minutes five more minutes five more minutes we're gonna go just a
little bit over little bit over Jazzy girl thank you for the 10 Subs give me
give me five more minutes we're going to go a little over
here all right who's heard of HTML 5 we talked about HTML being the content on
the page right talk about HTML being in the content page who's heard of
something called HTML 5 yep I see a lot of you have heard of

03:04
HTML 5 HTML 5 is the fifth version of HTML right it is the fifth version of
HTML the idea is that when the web first started the web is like what we use to
view these websites right the internet's the wires the the system but the web is
something that sits on top of it and when the web first came out um there we
had what we called the browser Wars all these companies said if we make the best
browser we will own the internet and so you would write code that work for one
that just literally didn't work for another and so so sir Tim burner Lee
rode in on their White Horse and they said wait a minute hold on hold on hold on
I I helped make all this stuff why don't we agree to some standards so that the
web will work for all and people kind of ignored them for like 10 years but
eventually they came to their senses and people started agreeing to these

03:05
standards and the worldwide Web Consortium or the w3c was created it's
the standards body that says hey let's all come together all the big folks from
all the big browsers all the big universities and people that are voted
on boards to protect the web and push it Forward well we are
on the fifth version right the fifth version of what HTML could
be and with this fifth version we got some new
stuff if you've ever watched a YouTube video in on the browser in your phone
you were dealing with HTML 5 video back in my day I had to open I had to
open right I had to open another program on my computer right to run

03:06
videos all right then we got things like flash and silver light which made
running videos in the Brows a little bit easier but then the web progressed even
further and now we have HTML 5 video that enables us to run videos in the
browser if you ever listen to SoundCloud or Spotify in the browser that's HTML 5
Audio if you've ever played those IO games like the agio sither.io like these
games that happen in the browser they're using HTML 5 canvas for all the
animations and stuff like that uh funny thing is that most of them are not
multiplayer if you turn off your Wi-Fi you keep playing the game all the
same I didn't know that that kind of broke my heart a little bit um a
geolocation when you go to to a website it can ask for your location like do you
want to let me know where you are or do I have to do Shady stuff like sniff your
IP address to figure out where you're from and then the last thing that we got
well not the last thing but one of the last big things we got with HTML 5 was

03:07
this idea of websockets it was uh old like open peer-to-peer connection so if
you've ever spent a late night on chat roulette or a megal talking about
politics you were benefiting from websockets so all this
stuff right right all this stuff is new it came by pushing the web
forward and we're on the fifth version of it
co tonight this is the most important thing I am going to show you uh thank
you for all the gifted Subs I appreciate you um tonight this is the most
important thing that I am going to show you it's called the Golden Rule Ru or
separation of concerns right the idea being here is
that the idea being that we want to keep

03:08
our concerns separate our HTML should be kept separate from our CSS our CSS
should be kept separate from our JavaScript and never should these things
mix remember HTML was our content CSS was our style
and JavaScript is our behavior and interaction so when you go to a
website and I asked you if I asked you to add an extra paragraph right if I
asked you to add an extra paragraph uh to your website what technology would
you use if I asked you to add an extra paragraph what would you use nice
HTML if I asked you to uh make something pink what technology would you use nice
CSS and if I asked you when you click something I want it to wiggle what would

03:09
you use JavaScript remember not Java Java is
a different language JavaScript nice now the idea here is that we don't want to
put CSS into our HTML or HTML into our JavaScript we want to keep them separate
why is this such an important rule the Golden Rule why is keeping our concerns
separate such a big deal why do you think yeah makes it easier to read and for
organization it's for Organization for yourself and it's Organization for the
team that you work on right when I come back to my code and I want to make
something purple I know to go to my CSS I don't have to look anywhere else I go
straight to my CSS and when someone on my team wants to add more text they can
go directly to the HTML right and when I come back to my

03:10
code six months later I have no idea what the heck's going on but I want to
make something wiggle I know I can go straight to my JavaScript and I don't
have to worry about anything ever being mixed so a lot of tutorials that you
will do will sometimes mix all these things together don't you want to keep
your concerns separate it's one of the first kind of serious things you're
going to accept as a professional software engineer that there are these
rules these paradigms that you agree to to set a standard for your
code all right we're going to head off with just some HTML I know we're a
little over tonight we're going to end off with a little bit of HTML if you do
have to run don't worry the VOD will be immediately available after class I
don't normally ever go over with class I just want to make sure we get to this
little bit of piece tonight uh and then we'll stop so we're stopping very soon
less than five minutes all right the first thing I said we were going to

03:11
cover is HTML we talked about HTML CSS and JavaScript being the languages of
the front end the interesting thing is that HTML and CSS are not technically
programming languages they're markup languages whereas JavaScript is a fully
featured programming language we're going to start off with HTML then we'll
move into CSS and then we'll move into JavaScript over the next couple of weeks
HTML like any language has what we call its
syntax right its syntax meaning the the rules and Rhymes that we have to use
when we write that language HTML syntax is very simple every bit of content on
the page must be wrapped in tags so here you see a little bit of text called Hol
world right s text called Hollow world that must
be incased in an opening tag and a closing tag right an opening tag and a

03:12
closing tag so here I have some text hello world and I'm going to have an
opening tag and a closing tag now there are lots of different kinds of tags that
we're going to learn on Thursday asan those tags has a
reason why you would use it right there's a reason why you would use that
tag as opposed to the other tag and the interesting thing is that there's really
only like 30 tags that you really need to know so by the end of Thursday's
class we'll have a pretty good handle and all the tags that you're going to
want to use this makes you miss Myspace yeah we're going to talk about that on
Thursday actually um a lot of developers
got their start there right so this idea is that whenever you're writing HTML
everything must be wrapped in tags uh there are like two tags that kind of
cheat this images and inputs since they're already content they don't need
closing tags they're already content themselves but let's not get ahead of

03:13
ourselves when you have content wrapping in tags so let me show you some code
real quick and then we're going to stop for the
evening all right so we're going to go ahead and look at this about page and
then we'll stop with that about page so here's some
code right now it is just text right but if I want this to be HTML if I want a
server to be able to respond with this so that this file can run in my browser
I need to wrap every bit of content inside of tags please don't code along
tonight we'll start coding together on Thursday that's why I said after
Thursday you will be true software Engineers you will have written your
first line of code tonight just pay attention to what I'm doing so I can
explain a concept for Thursday's class you're
going to need some sort of text editor or something like code pen or glitch

03:14
where you can write code but don't worry we'll start off class with those things
you don't have to download anything ahead of time this text editor is what I
use called vs code and it's what I use to write pretty much all of my code here
I have some plain text and every bit of text must be wrapped in what chat all my
texts must be wrapped in what exactly must be wrapped in tags and
remember I said there are different tags for different reasons or different
purposes when we're choosing tags we care about one the importance of that
element and two the semantic meaning behind that content and so what I will
wind up doing is wrapping all of this text in actual tag so here's a tag that
I'm going to wrap this in called an H1 you're going to notice that this H1

03:15
opens and then the H1 closes and the only difference right the only
difference is that lovely little forward
SL so you're going to notice that pretty much all your opening tags are going to
look like your closing tags except for that forward slash all right now I chose
to wrap this first class 100 devs in an H1 because I thought it was the most
important content on the page there are going to be tags that we use that help
us to know if something is important there going to be tags that help us to
know what type of content it may be right and so the idea here is that we're
eventually going to wrap all of our content in the appropriate tag right now
first class 100 devs if you came to this
website that's what I want you to know I don't want you to walk with anything
else except for that so it was the most important if we look at this text

03:16
here we have a big block of text if you were to read a book or a magazine and
you saw a big block of text what would you call that big block of text in a
book or a magazine there there you go we
call it a paragraph So in HTML we have a P tag this right here that open carrot
and the p is the P tag that opens and we go to the end and we close our P tag
right so we have this lovely open and we have the lovely close boom open and
close now we also have here a a bunch of locations we might say
we have a what of locations yeah a list of locations well

03:17
in HTML there are two kinds of lists there are ordered lists and unordered
lists right to me yes these might be in alphabetical order but nobody's getting
in trouble if these are not in the right order think of like a recipe or yeah
think of like a recipe if you like try and make a recipe but things are not in
the right order right if you try to make
a recipe but things are not in the right
order you're going to wind up in trouble
like if you try to put like the cake mix before you put in the water and you put
it into the oven before you stirred it you're going to have a bad batch of
brownies right you're going have a bad Bratch of brownies so for me it doesn't
matter if these are not in order so I'm going to use an unordered list I'm going
to have my UL that opens and I'm going to take this closing tag and go all the
way to the end and make sure that my entire list is wrapped in a

03:18
UL right now what do you typically have on a list like if I had a grocery list
what goes on a grocery list items exactly
items go on our grocery list and so here I have a bunch of items that go in this
UL we're going to call these list items and so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go ahead and I am going to wrap each one of
these in An Li and you're like Leon what is this developer magic that you are
doing well don't worry you come back Thursday I will show you you how to do
cool stuff like this and this is the reason why we use a text editor it's the
reason why we don't just like open up a Google doc and start writing code there
are tools and tricks and things that you can learn inside of your text editor

03:19
these shortcuts that make writing code way easier right way
easier now down here we have another what another block of text so we
probably have another what another paragraph exactly so we're going
to reuse our P tag here P tag is going to open and we're going to come over
here and our P Tag's going to close nice now the cool thing is we can
save all of this and then what we can actually do is if we want we can come
back to our browser and see it in the browser don't worry about how to do this
we're going to go over all this stuff on Thursday but here is our lovely website
that we just built right using some very basic HTML tags the thing that really
catches my eye first is that this first class 100 devs

03:20
is big bold black and beautiful much like myself but what's interesting about
that what should what should handle something being big and bold right what what
should handle that being big and bold what should be what should that
that should be CSS did I write any CSS I don't think so let me check I
don't see any I don't see any CSS no I didn't so this is the browser Wars alive
and well remember how I said the browsers kind of just did their own
thing and they applied their own style and they did whatever the heck they
wanted but we're still fighting that battle and so when we come back on
Thursday I'm going to show you how to solve this problem to make sure that
when we write HTML it's just HTML we'll eventually Le how to write CSS to handle

03:21
this right and we're going to progress into learning the basics of HTML so I
hope you learned some stuff this evening I hope you had some fun kind of laying
the groundwork for the course laying the groundwork for to
come understanding how you really should approach the learning process active
recall spaced repetition I hope you had fun learning how the internet works at a
very basic level and I hope this little sniff of HTML get you excited for
Thursday because we're going deep on it and if tonight the HTML didn't make any
sense don't worry we're going to spend all Thursday just on HTML making sure it
makes sense and make sure it clicks now now you don't want to
run you want to hang around for a second because we are going to do a raid and

03:22
when you raid you get more Channel points so we're going to raid one of our
best mentors in the community um someone that always shows up time and time uh
again for our community and so we're going to raid them and whenever we do a
raid uh the whole point is just to spend share some love and positivity to give
them a follow and to see what they're up to in building we only ever really raid
folks that are developers as well and so this developer is someone that really
knows their stuff and turns up to help you all the time so give them some love
give them a follow and I will see you all hanging out over there when you're
done with the raid and you're done hanging out make sure you do your active
recall start your space repetition and I will see you all on Thursday thank you
for a wonderful first class everyone uh I'm starting the raid and we're going to
go over there in 10 seconds so don't forget Thursday 6:30 p.m. eastern time

03:23
we go live we're diving into HTML I'll see you all over there with the raid
peace
