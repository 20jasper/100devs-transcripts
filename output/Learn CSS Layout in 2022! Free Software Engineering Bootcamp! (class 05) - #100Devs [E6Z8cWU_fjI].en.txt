00:01

00:02

00:03
so yo hey yo oh i don't think we ever let it go along with this hey [Music]
what's up good morning good afternoon no
matter where you're coming from hope you all are doing well what's going on
everybody hey welcome back hope you all had a wonderful weekend
uh i the yaws the yells in the beginning are just to check the closed captioning

00:04
that's what it's all about so you hear the yellows you know the closed
captioning is working uh looks like we're doing good today
what's going on everybody hope you all had a great weekend
glad you decided to give us some time on tuesday to get into some more
css i'm so happy to have you let's do this thing so
uh if you're new around these parts welcome we are doing a free 30-week
software engineering boot camp right i don't know what that sound was what's
that sound for thank you for the gift it's up
uh we are doing a free 30 week software engineering bootcamp we are on class
five we're just getting into some more depth css so if you're new to coding
you're new to html you're new to css we got a great stream for you we're going
to get into a lot of other fun stuff tonight we're going to touch on layout
for the very very first time and we're just going to start building bigger and

00:05
better sites uh i think we bring down glitch every
time i think we have to like actually go talk to them about this um
so if you can't use glitch code pen works uh if you can't use codepen you
can use a replit so replit codepen glitch anywhere you can just put your
html so that we have it you're good don't worry about it being
specifically uh glitch the only thing i don't want you to use
is like getting github for right now yeah just give me something that's like
an actual link to the html glitch codepen uh replit any of those are good for
right now uh just we'll get the git and github
down the line but yeah any of those three for right now are totally fine uh
don't worry about if it broke on you right now you can do it until the end of
class don't worry when you take a break feel free to use it occ through the
replica in chat for those that need that link but um
yeah don't don't don't sweat it too much all right as always as we let folks get

00:06
in here i like to start off with some questions
and so the the main question of the day was would you rather have a one minute
conversation with your past self or your future self
so go ahead and put past or future past the future in chat for me please
i really do like these questions and i said i said this before but i feel like
i get to know y'all a little bit better over time i start to recognize the names
and uh these answers are the fun ones that enable that to happen so past
versus future i i i need to i need to go shake leon a couple years ago
real hard it's not even me talking it's just me violently shaking myself
future leon just appears and i'm just like
doing this for a minute and then i just disappear again yeah i'm
it's so balanced though i think a lot of people were saying past

00:07
but then we got like a big shipment of future and so it's interesting
i think it makes sense a lot of folks are like wanting to talk to their future
stuff like hey did this coding thing like did it happen did it work out that
makes sense we're all here to learn how to code it'd be nice to know that like
all the hard work you're putting in like yeah in like 10 years you're like yeah
that was that was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] worth it right i i can see that being
while you're in a boot camp experience future could be really helpful at this
like particular point in time would make
the trough of sorrow maybe just a little bit sweeter a little bit easier
but uh yeah i need to go back and talk to past leon we got some we got some
stuff to clean up all right folks as always like to give folks a little
bit of time to get in here so i i like to answer a few questions
i'd like to answer a few questions while we get started

00:08
i don't give stock or nft advice on stream uh mainly for the sole reason i don't
want you to come back in like a week and be like leon my life savings is gone so
yeah i know that you'll never hear about that from me
maybe some fun projects that i like but uh you know seven minute you're fine
what do you think of data science as a career i think it'd be a cool career i
think it's slightly harder to get into than full stack web development and
that's why this is a full stack web development boot camp and not a day
science i think there's slightly more jobs right now for well not slightly
there's more jobs for full stack web development and a lot of folks that i
know that go into data science they typically have a
little bit more advanced like schooling not that you need it to necessarily go
into data science it's just that it tends to help if you have a degree and
stuff like that and so i like full stack web development because you very much
don't need a degree to get into it how much time will we spend on recursive

00:09
functions i think we'll have like a class where it comes up
cyber security now i just tell people to stay away from cyber security unless
it's like your passion uh cyber security is just so scammy right now
it's just it's just it's just what web development was five years ten years ago
where everyone's trying to sell you a shovel it's just really hard for new
folks to get started um i i think it's just it's just scary not
that it's not this that it's not not that it's not a great career now it's
not something that you should do if you're interested in it just be careful
that's all i say when folks want to do cyber security just be careful don't
ever let me or anybody else tell you not
to do it right but just be extra careful a lot of people selling shovels right
now can you kick flip no i have a skateboard right now and i
haven't skated in a very long time and i i had muscles that i didn't know
were muscles that were hurting after i was just like skating around in a

00:10
parking lot and this is after skating for like years probably 10 plus years of
my life and i was just skating around the parking lot and i'm like damn i'm old
there's there's i'm just feeling things i haven't felt in a long long time
whiz or prevalent off whiz all day what are you talking about
yeah it wasn't even like my knees it was just it was just like other stuff yeah
bootstrapper tailwind i've been playing around with talonwin recently i'm a fan
uh just so much of my stuff is bootstrapped though i've just used it
for so long but yeah i've been i've been playing around with tailwind i think
it's fun is it okay to use divs sometimes of
course of course it's okay to use dips sometimes

00:11
did i get any shinies today no i did not get any shiny pokemon today
i've never played star citizen i've watched it you know
all right folks maybe one or two more questions and then we'll get started i
always like to just give the folks a few few minutes to get in here uh
[Laughter] do i have a vr headset i do not i every
once in a while i don't know if i should actually say this with this many people
here i'll say it nah maybe i'll say it they can't get me
maybe they can i don't know but best buy has a loner program i don't
know if you ever heard about this best buy learner program folks
so the best buy lunar program is that best buy if you are a best buy rewards
member they give you 30 days to return stuff
and if you buy enough they actually give you 45 days to return stuff

00:12
and uh they often don't pay restocking fees you don't pay for stocking fees on
most of this stuff so if you want a vr headset i mean you
can like go get a vr headset use it for 43 days and then just uh return it
that's the best buy learner program so i've done that once
i just i think vr was fun i just i just don't think i would use it regularly yet
um but i can see i can see in the near future you know
they actually have a restocking view on cameras now specifically because of this
because so many not me i would never do this
so many people used to go to best buy get a really nice camera when they went
on vacation and then as soon as they came back from vacation returned the camera
and uh yes now there's a restocking fee on cameras don't ask me how i know it
because i totally didn't do it but alrighty folks let's get into it let's

00:13
talk about what we're going to learn today or work on today
we're going to be covering our css fundamentals again so if last class the
css didn't fully click that's okay lots of review to have we had tonight we're
gonna be covering specificity again making sure that we understand kind of
the point values behind using tags classes ids and others we're going to
look at our relationship selectors again we're going to see those really funky
kind of sibling parent child direct parent child and get some some fun
practicing with those we're probably going to go a little overboard with the
selectors today uh just because i i i really like a game that we're gonna play
with the selectors then we're gonna talk about the box model so many of you had
questions about the box model it even came up uh on sunday during office hours
so we're gonna spend a lot of time talking about the box model
everything in web development's a box folks every single thing web
development's a box then we're going to look at some simple layouts
we're going to create a simple layout together live and then

00:14
your homework will be able to create three
more so lots of good review to get into folks lots of
uh new things to cover and so we're gonna jump right into it and let's start off
with checking in if you haven't checked in all right if
you haven't checked in go ahead and do exclamation point check in you can
always grab the check in uh tweet on discord in the following materials
channel or the live channel thank you for all the gifted subs i'm
going to turn that down for right now there we go um
so you can always check in if you would like
i appreciate it helps grow our community helps folks find us they don't spend a
lot of money on a boot camp so yeah go ahead and check in
go ahead and give it a like a retweet please
and let's talk about submitting that homework seems like we brought down

00:15
glitch again uh so rip uh if you want to use something other than glitch like a
code pen or a replit you can but i want the khan academy
and i want the tech crunch html so there should be no css it's just the html
i would like them in separate links please and then there is the form uh to
submit it and of course that form is on discord as well so
go ahead and submit the form and you will have submitted your homework
for folks that want to be in touring or hopper the homework is always
due before class starts and then for everybody else 24 hours later cool
we've been working hard uh my team myself on getting our study communities
together on thursday we'll be sharing more about the study communities uh
we'll be sharing the actual survey for you to jump into them and we'll be

00:16
sharing more about kind of the the other houses as well so that's coming on
thursday uh we just gotta tweak a few more things and get you all ready and
then we'll start getting you into these study communities i'm really excited for
these i really think it's going to give you a smaller group to connect with
there are so many things that tie different pockets of our community
together and i i'm really excited for you all to have smaller homes to to work
together uh to commiserate together and to to be able to uh get the help and
support that you need and so we have lots of different things lots of
different things that people might have an affinity for or something that they
deal with or something that they just want to organize around and so yeah
we're gonna have these lovely study communities coming uh on thursday we'll
be sharing out that survey and then we'll start adding everyone to them so
gonna be a lot of fun uh it's gonna be a lot of work for the the mod team over
the next couple of days so if you see a mod give them give them a thank you

00:17
every once in a while i i think i think you don't realize how much uh work the
mods are putting in to like keep the discord an amazing space uh to keep
twitch in amazing space and so as always uh super huge thank you to the mod
community uh it's what keeps all this going cool
alumni twitter space uh so many of you all love twitter spaces so we'll be
doing our first one on friday that's right folks friday this
friday january 28th at 6 00 p.m we'll be having the twitter space we have a
couple of alumni that are signed up that
are just going to come share their story share about their experience at
100 devs share their experience about getting a job and then answer your
questions and so we have it we have it slated for an hour
uh it might come a little bit later and it will be recorded so if you can't make
it uh we'll we'll have it recorded as well yeah
i don't think it'll be uploaded to to youtube or anything like that because a

00:18
lot of times we share a lot of stuff that maybe should stay in the twitter space
yeah yeah so maybe maybe maybe not gonna get
uploaded anywhere else but the recording will be on twitter yeah so a lot of you
like the twitter spaces so we're gonna try this format we've used a different
platform in the past so this will be our first time trying it uh and we're gonna
bring alumni back regularly right and so this won't be a one and done thing this
is something that we're gonna try and bring every week every every couple
weeks or so just to get folks that have gone through the program uh back
talking to you all telling you about their struggles the
things that went well the things that went right things that went wrong the
things they wish they could redo right and so we're going to start that on
friday and so shout out to all the alumni that are always here on
uh discord et cetera uh and just a shout out to like you like i know we
showed out the alumni shout out to mods but like shout out to all y'all too like

00:19
the the the the the thing that makes me the happiest in the world right now
is if i go to let's see i'm gonna do this live right in front of myself now
i am going just into the homework help channel on our discord
and every single question has answers 9 6 14 12 50 plus 24 3 5 17 1 8 2
27 3 12 2 32 3 50 plus 6 4 6 nine like i'm just i'm just reading
right just reading uh from that community
and so that that's y'all right and so we we keep talking about this idea that we
switched to the threads and the threads have been amazing
because y'all show up time and time again to help each other to answer each

00:20
other's questions and i've honestly never seen anything like it
find me another forum where every single
question's getting answers right find me a form where every single question is
getting answers where they're getting 50 plus answers on a singular question it
doesn't exist except for right here this is hands down the best community to
learn how to code live online i don't care anywhere uh it's just
i've never seen anything like it and i've been in this game for a long time
been in this game for a long long time so thank you to all y'all too all right
channel points uh right now i'm playing with the channel points
i feel i feel bad because some folks i i don't always see the channel points
because there's so much going on and so i fixed a lot of things on my end
uh one i made sure that all the things are now more expensive
they are more expensive for right now uh just right now just while we're playing

00:21
with it and i'm trying to get it dialed in the things are more expensive
and some of them are rate limited so like some of them can only be um
used once a class right eventually once we figure it out dialed
in the prices will come down right the prices will come down
but some things for right now yeah inflation uh
for right now the prices are high and some things are limited to maybe like
one or two a stream lecture juice with the bruh
all right and so the idea here is that they they will they will be a little bit
more sparse which i think will be good that way i can see them come through on
my screen and i have it set up now to see the requests that come in a little
bit easier and so i'll be able to pay attention to a little bit more i'll be
able to do the things that show up on it um but
that's we're working on it i'm trying to get it dialed in a little bit more it's
just there's a lot going on and uh yeah now it's a little bit more expensive and

00:22
some of them are limited i should be able to see them all and when you all
make me hydrate i can hydrate things like that
i will note that the only fans price did not change
all right only fans has been the same price it'll stay the same price
better lady thank you for the bits alrighty typing
uh we had a lot of questions over can you all hear that we go get
did you all hear that we go get we don't get got we go get we're able to hear it
yeah okay cool cool i'm turning off monitoring of my system sounds and so i
just want to make sure that y'all could hear too cool all right
some of the things oh also some of the things right now channel points have
been turned off there are some bigger things that have been turned off just

00:23
while we figure out a process for them with so many folks um we just got to
figure out a better process for it and so the bigger ones that we're taking off
will be coming back just finding a process for a lot of them yeah cool typing
a lot of folks have been reaching out about feeling bad about their typing or
having lots of questions about their typing
don't here's the thing a lot of folks start off using two fingers to type
that's okay the idea is that while you're going throughout this process
you want to get better at your typing you want to invest time over the next 30
weeks getting better at your typing bringing up your words per minute right
but also making sure you're using all of your fingers now i'm not here to tell
you that you have to use all your fingers you do you the passionate appeal
that i want to make to you and and different was and different ghosts was on um
in the asking on channel helping folks with this too is the thing that i want

00:24
you to to remember is that you're doing a lot of stuff with your
fingers that you might never have done before
even if you've been playing video games since you were little and you're an mmo
champion there's just certain like keys that we'll be hitting every single
day over and over and over again the flexion on your pinky every day will be
just over and over and over again and so the the touch typing using all your
fingers it's really not necessarily about the speed it's about
reducing the stretch reducing the strain on your fingers right
i say this every single cohort at resilient coders
i tell them three of you are going to the hospital
every single cohort i tell them in every
single cohort it it happens at least one to three folks right go to the hospital

00:25
every single cohort i run of my like rc cohorts and that those are smaller
cohorts so there's thousands of us here i can only imagine how many of you
will eventually injure yourself if you don't take your typing seriously
if you don't take your posture seriously if you don't take your breaks seriously
it is a lot of hard work putting stress on a lot of these bones and fingers and
ligaments that you might not have ever done and so like i said typing is not
necessarily about speed it's about being able to do this for the rest of your
career so if you're able make sure you can transition to maybe
using all your fingers uh sitting in a good way uh maybe
being a little bit more conscious about kind of how you are working throughout
the day and making sure you're doing things ergonomically make sure you're
taking your breaks at the top of every hour make sure you're getting your

00:26
stretches in all these wonderful things we shared the dr levi the fitness
doctors video i'll put that in discord again after class because i think it's
just a really good video to make sure that you're taking care of your hands
and getting the good stretches in take care of yourself in other ways too
maybe you use flux to lower the um to change the temperature of your screens
right just take a little bit time in your setup and thinking through how you
can do this healthily for the longest amount of time
flux is a program that's free uh that helps change the um
temperature of your screen so that it's not burning your eyeballs all the time
all the time basically a night mode for all the time
or or it even has like um as the day gets long later it like it it changes

00:27
with the day leon are special glasses helpful too
i have blue light blocking my glasses when i got them from warby parker i've
seen like different like science on it some people say it works
some people say it doesn't i don't think i would i think that if you have the
option then yeah sure why not but i'm not sure like running out and
getting blue light blocking glasses will do it for you
but it's not if you're if you're having really strong sensitivity to it um
you're maybe try it but for me i don't really know
honestly the science is um a little wishy-washy at my point but try it
better than nothing the lady is stressing me out i'm sorry
this is this is what this is what it looks like when i this this is remember
i told about like 10 minutes until the client project is due this is what i
look like 10 minutes until the client project is due it's just really loud
trap music and me just like gritting my teeth and just

00:28
mashing my keyboard as fast as i can cool
somebody said what are channel points uh
travel points are points you get just by watching and tuning into class
and so while you're here you're accumulating channel points and you can
use those for fun silly or useful things by clicking the my little face at the
bottom of the chat window how did i survive without flux this
whole time it really is a game changer uh just be careful
here's one thing to be careful about is that when you have flux on
colors will be different i have i i'm not afraid to bend this i have shipped
code like i have shipped a design with all the wrong colors
because i was like looking at them differently what flux on

00:29
uh so just just be careful uh it will change the color of your
screen and that might be something you you got to keep in mind so like if i'm
doing stuff where i'm looking at a design like we're doing right now and
translating it if i'm looking at the colors i i gotta you gotta be careful
that you're you're you're um you don't have flux still on uh
lord said uh yeah i'm a designer i've messed up a lot of projects due to flux
yeah i i i i've been there with you so just be careful turn it off if you're
doing any like color work or things like that
also folks who are asking about colors i use digital color meter
so built into max is this lovely digital color meter and you can just
hover your mouse over any color and it'll give you the rgb value right here um
and so i use this all the time like if a designer does not give me colors
i just use digital color meter to grab that color

00:30
if you're not on a mac windows and gnu linux have similar
applications that you can install that do the same thing but on mac it's
just digital color meter there are eyedroppers you can install on
chrome but then the color picker only works in chrome
so yeah i would definitely make sure you get a color picker that's on your
desktop so that you can find colors very easily all right
i'm gonna keep keep bringing this reminder up but
the name of the game here folks is to go deep not wide all right
i saw some folks last cohort and it happened again in this cohort
i was asking for html and they were trying to add javascript

00:31
to their khan academy and uh uh please don't
we're not there yet please don't do that um the person that did it last cohort i
asked him i asked him what is the semantic meaning of an aside
and they couldn't tell me i was like wait a minute so instead of actually
learning the stuff that we covered in class multiple times
you just leroy jenkins the crap out of it and ran ahead to javascript
but you don't know the basics of html i don't know
i don't know sounds like you kind of i did too much
sounds like you went a little too wide now not deep enough right
and so don't get got please don't get got make sure that you are going deep

00:32
not wide make sure that you are not putting all that extra stress on yourself
make sure you're giving yourself time for things to sink in please don't
even if you feel like you've put it like if you feel like you put in a good
amount of work stop for the day right don't don't keep doing these super long
marathon days every day it just won't keep it up
99 of you just won't keep it up maybe you're that one percent and i all the
power to you but i've seen so many of my most brilliant students just burn out
right so go deep not wide right and as things pick up you're gonna add
more and more but don't keep giving yourself all this extra work it's just
not it's just not worth it and what you're doing what you're doing most likely

00:33
is not cementing the stuff that really needs to be cementing right like if
you're not giving your brain that diffusive time if you're not giving your
brain that rest and the sleep that it needs all the stuff you put all that
work into actually learning and cranking the hours for you're just gonna forget
even with the best anki routine it's just too much so build up the pace
build up the pace right build up the pace make sure that you're reviewing the
stuff that we covered i'm giving you bangers only right go deep not wide
to usa said the motivation guy last week said not to sleep and that's why my
caveat next to the video was please sleep though
like odd it literally says please sleep though next to the video
uh because that that's the misstep that's the misstep

00:34
please sleep we know what sleep does to memory consolidation right
you will not commit any of that stuff to memory if you do not sleep
now here's here's where i think the advice comes in and
this is actually from garyvee uh say what you want uh but
had some really i think is an important thing to keep in mind uh garyvee says
tell me what you do between seven and two and i'll tell you how successful you
are and i actually don't think the seven to two matters i don't think like
staying up late matters but i think the the core of
is what's being said there is are you maximizing your time right
not all of us have the privilege of seven to two
not all of us have the privilege of being able to wake up early
but with what time that you have what are you doing with it but the time

00:35
that you do have are you getting the most out of it right
don't sacrifice sleep because that just won't help with memory consolidation but
when you've accounted for sleep you've accounted for family you've accounted
for everything you need to keep track of in your life and you have that other
time what are you doing with it right and so we all come from different
experiences we all come from different backgrounds we all have different
privileges when it comes to time it's not about
raw hours is about what are you doing with the hours that you do have
right for some folks they they don't get the wheels turning
enough to take advantage of the time that they do have and then it falls off
so with the time that you do have are you going into that time like an
accident did you make a plan did you make a plan a couple days ago
did you make a plan for the week you have a plan for the day
if you don't have a plan for the day the
hours that you do have are going to slip away

00:36
right so we're gonna keep bringing up these ideas right go deep don't go wide
get plenty of sleep but don't go into your days like an accident have a plan
and what you're gonna do right and then be consistent we know
being consistent is what gets us through the trough of sorrow cool
what about us nine to fivers do you mean like that you're working or that you're
studying nine to five uh because if you're working nine to five then that
that that spiel kind of applies do you have time outside of your nine to five
how much time do you have do you have an
hour do you have a half hour do you have three hours and what are you doing with
that time you know working parents are going to have it
harder right like like let's be real right like if you're a working parent
you got all my respect in the world right that that that's the the not

00:37
having the privilege of time right and so you're never going to hear me say
that everyone has that same access to time it's what are you doing at the time
that you do have are you being having a good plan for that time and are you
putting in the the the game plan realistically right
are you putting in that game plan realistically right and then just try and be
consistent just to shout it from the mountaintops you're doing anki fine
if you're doing anki you are leagues better than all the folks not doing anki
right if you're if you're if you're opening up
your anki every day you have one let's say that one more time get big here

00:38
if you have opened your anki every day you've already run you've already you've
already won all right you've already won you get the golden prize right
there's there's there's there is no 100 right way to use anki other than to just
use it create cards and review those cards there's no magic to it i don't
have any secret settings i'm not doing anything different than you are other
than making like decks and tags i'm going to show you more of my decks and tags
hopefully this weekend at office hours i wanted to clean up a little bit so it
made more sense for folks because mine are like shorthand [Music] and so
you're doing fine if you've been opening
anki every day you've already won you're doing okay
let this be a a a shot across the bow for folks that haven't been doing anki
every day just opening it using it getting your repetition is is how it works

00:39
right so just do it just do it just do it so you gotta do it yep that's it
alrighty next thing i talk about your goal as you're learning any language
especially for the first time especially for the first time right
your goal always should be to vomit your code
and then clean it up later let me say it one more time
your goal should be to vomit your code and then clean it up later okay

00:40
your job is to get the job done refactoring is for closers i mean let me
let me break down a little bit here right in the beginning you have no no luxury
of committing to best practice you have no luxury to committing to
quality code you have no luxury of committing to maintainable code your only job
is to vomit all over your keyword all over your keyboard and get the job done
the job for pretty much every single assignment in this cohort will be
does it look like the photo or does it do what it's supposed to do

00:41
that's how you should judge every single thing you do in this boot camp
does it look like the photo and does it do the thing it's supposed
to do because if it does the thing it's supposed to do you wrote phenomenal code
if it looks like the photo you wrote phenomenal code full stop that's it
it's all that matters i don't care if you use the right tags i don't care if it
is great code i don't care if someone would look at it and scream
we're here to write the chunkiest of vomit and get the job done no
hiring partner is going to look at the html you wrote
in class four to make a hiring decision just a little bit more time let's go big

00:42
here no hiring partner is going to look at the css you wrote in
class 5 and go there's no way i can hire this person
so get that out of your mind no one will
ever see it no one will ever care you're here to write vomit
i'm going to write vomit with you because it just doesn't matter get the
job done so many folks stress they they they they worry themselves
about making sure they're using everything in the right way and they use
that stress to stop them from getting the job done
no one's gonna look at your code they just won't especially not right now
no clean code right now this is day five now in five five months from now
five months from now you're still you're still producing vomit in html and css

00:43
then then maybe we got a problem but in the first three months that's
vomit time baby that that's that's vomit time first three months on
the job not on the job but there's three months here uh it's vomit time it just
doesn't matter right get the job done get it looking
the way it's supposed to look and then get the job done that's it cool now
once you've gotten the job done right it looks like the photo or it does
the thing that's supposed to do you've gotten done your reading you've
gotten done your videos daisy said i'm still vomiting six years
later and getting paid exactly once you're done the day is done you've
done everything you're supposed to do for the week and you have more time you
can go back and refactor if you choose refactoring is for closers refactoring
means you go back you clean up your vomit you put it in the bag you take it
outside right but in the beginning vomit
if you get through all the stuff you got to get through that week go back and

00:44
refactor right but we write vomit around here cool all right
here's the really sad thing that's happening right now
the sad thing that's happening right now is y'all are nasty
y'all some nasty people it's true you know you don't want to know why
you're looking at other people's vomit and you're going
why is mine not as chunky as theirs how did they get their vomit so chunky
why were they able to throw up more than me
how come they can throw up farther than me why why
why why is there vomit a little bit farther than a little bit more chunky

00:45
how can i make my vomit as chunky as theirs
right you are admiring other people's vomit y'all nasty
why are you looking at other people's vomit and then feeling bad about your
vomit it's disgusting knock it off just don't do it why why are you like
licking up other people's vomit it just doesn't make any sense
y'all some nasty individuals so please when you're writing vomit
don't get jealous at the other person's vomit
you don't know how long they've been vomiting for you have no idea if
they had a better breakfast than you they could have had an amazing breakfast
and you did not so why are you upset when they got more chunks it just
doesn't matter don't worry your vomit will be as chunky as their vomit going

00:46
into the future but for now right for now it just makes no sense
right it makes them it makes no sense to get upset about
other people's vomit okay so as we progress some folks can be farther along some
folks will be a little bit behind it all equals out in the end
don't don't get upset over people other people's vomit it just doesn't make
sense you know the sad thing is i really did like vomit hard on monday
like really bad like like really bad i had to cancel a few meetings because i
it was just it was just it was upsetting and so all i'm gonna say is when i was
looking at these slides today right as i
was reviewing them before class and as i was working on them i was just not

00:47
feeling the best i would just not feel the best i really
think it was food poisoning but it didn't last long enough to be food
poisoning i think um yeah so what i what i think it was is uh i
haven't had red meat or pork since i was like nine and so [Music]
i think sometimes when i eat stuff that's been like cross-contaminated it
just like soup comes right back um so i think that's what happened
anyway you don't even know about my vomit you shouldn't care about my vomit
just like you shouldn't care about other
people's vomit i'm glad i made that work that was a good one
tap myself on the back there that was a good one all right now
let's talk about code standards i laughed about this last cohort too i'm
just like don't worry about anything don't worry about best practice don't
worry about anything here's the best practice that we should all adhere to

00:48
i laughed at the same thing last year but it's still [Laughter]
funny all right anyway so don't worry about anything code wise
here's something you need to worry about all right
we want to make sure that our html has all of our content in it we want to make
sure that our css has all of our style you want to make sure that our
javascript has all of our behavior and interaction and we don't want to mix any
of these uh up at all why why do we want to keep
our html our content separate from our style or style separate from our
behavior why is this golden rule such an important rule
organization exactly organization nice cool
where does our css go chat where does our css go

00:49
and i know slow mode is on so you can't always like follow up right away
dmacc hey i appreciate that note yeah we want it in a separate file
we want to agree to that separation of concern so we put our css in a separate
file there are some exceptions what is the exception for writing inline style
what's the exception for writing an inline style yeah email exactly you're
writing email you might not well you don't have access to external style
sheets and so any really nice emails you're looking at are probably done with
html with inline style there is an exception that we heard about
uh when it comes to in the head hey nate thank you for the 5k the subs i
appreciate that uh in the head yep if we're working at
amazon and we're working with critical path css
they they really are concerned about super super super fast speed because for

00:50
every one second their page load speed increases they lose a million dollars a
day and so they have critical pass css where it's just enough to load the above
the fold and then everything else goes in the external style sheet and then we
just normally would have it in a separate file nice all right folks
pay attention tonight i like it we're in here
yeah we got our active recall in our space repetition's on fire all right
since we're putting our css in a separate file remember we have to have
that link tag uh in the head of our document and we're going to tell it
where to go find our css so our html we got to point to where our css is and
this href tells it where to go find that style sheet cool
we talked about how this whole thing is called a rule a rule is broken down
into a selector and a declaration block and then declaration blocks are broken

00:51
down declarations properties and values so let's play our favorite game and
say what part of css is this so what is this whole thing called trap
we use other best practices of course we'll do things like mvc yeah we'll get
to that way down the line yeah whole thing is a rule a rule is broken down into
two things but what is this thing what's that try to
get the pre-guessers a little off the off their uh mark there yeah it's a
property um how about about this let me unco uncircle the other one
though about that what's that a declaration nice it's a declaration
remember the whole thing is a declaration we had the property on the

00:52
on the on the left-hand side uh what is this yep that's our selector nice our
selector and then how about this it's our value nice nice how about this
yep so declaration block nice nice cool and then how about how about this
that would be a colon yes that's a colon [Laughter]
it's not specific to a rule but there are colons and semicolons and part of
the declaration cool hold on everybody cat's own point tonight i'm feeling it

00:53
all right now we talked about this idea of the cascade meaning that
tags that come above can be overwritten by tags that come below
and i don't feel like we had a really good example of how the cascade comes
into effect but we're gonna get a really good example later tonight so later
tonight we're gonna have a pretty good example that'll show
that cascade and effect so we can see how it could be really useful to you in
the future so i promise that we'll see a good example of the cascade later today
uh here is an example but it doesn't really show like a why right it's just
it just it's something that works but it's not really a why so
if you're struggling with understanding when the cascade would be helpful we're
gonna see that tonight okay so here we have a paragraph rule
where we set the color to red and then the font way to bold and then for some
reason we wrote another paragraph rule below it

00:54
and since both of these rules have the same level of specificity
the one that is below can override the one that comes above
right and so in this case the paragraphs
will now all be blue because that's what was overridden but they still
will have the font weight of bold because there's nothing that override
the font weight here so you wind up with blue bold paragraphs right blue bold
paragraphs because of that cascade and so we're going to see
some of this cascade come alive today yeah like i said ghost we're gonna see
that example later alrighty one more time why would we want
to link our css in a separate file yep separation of concerns prius

00:55
yup organization exactly beautiful yep so here's separation
concerns keep our keep our code organized uh to make sure that we're not
mixing our content and our style lovely alrighty
let's review some simple styles and then we're going to get our fingers on the
keyboard again okay let's do some simple styles and we're going to get our
fingers on the keyboard all right we talked about color keywords uh last
class where if we want to make something the color red we can just by using the
color keyword but we can also use hexadecimal values rgba values hsla
values all just different ways of getting color done right i use rgb
or rgba this is the one i feel the most comfortable with i like using the
digital color meter i pull up the color really quickly i plug it in when i need

00:56
to plug it in and i love that alpha channel the ability to have like
transparency a lot of folks a lot of folks that are like hipsters or
come from a print background they like that hsla
some folks that are that are just machines have hexadecimal values like
just memorized especially folks that may have been designers for a really long
time there are some people that just can like look at stuff and know the hex
value like almost exactly uh so you might feel very comfortable with but
when you're just kind of like getting a project out the gate you're just trying
to get the job done it's fine to use color keywords don't stress about the
colors when you're just trying to get the job done when you're writing your
vomit just choose the color keywords you always come back and specify the exact
color if you want all right talked about the different font families uh we
we had the source sans pro which is my favorite font uh but we see here in this

00:57
font family uh we had sour sands pro but then helvetica and then sans serif uh
why why do we have three here why not one yeah they're backups exactly right so
the idea is if for some reason sources pro doesn't load helvetica will load if
for some reason that doesn't load then we just get the regular sans serif that
every every browser has and um i mentioned that loading here i am using
uh the google fonts to load in that font you could download font files and
then import them or have them linked in another way but
i find the google fonts be pretty easy on the very very very very rare instance
that um google fonts goes down i always have
like a nice backup that still looks good on my site but yeah excuse me

00:58
excuse me excuse me um how reliable is google fonts i've seen i've seen
google's apis go down twice um way back in the day
i believe it was i don't know i want to put this on google but it was like the
biggest jquery uh cdn so this is i'm dating myself here
this is like way back in the day i remember the biggest like jquery cdn
going down uh and i was teaching and the other teacher that was teaching
at the same time we had like glass windows at general assembly and they
like come and they're like they're like looking at me like this
like they're they're like freaking out uh because jquery went down
and when jquery went down like all these websites just like one offline like it
was just not offline but they just all broke
um because a lot of people didn't use like really good fallbacks back in the

00:59
day a lot of people that just didn't know to have like a backup source for
your jquery code and so it just it just broke
um so i'm really dating myself here with the jquery reference but
that was my funny so so these things can
go down they're not always working right um people keep like all caps hydration
that's what channel points are for folks you use the channel points i get the
hydrate you got you got to keep me got to keep the liquids coming in i'm not
going to hydrate unless unless the channel points come in you know come on now
we're cheap [Laughter] occ thank you for the hydration cheers to you

01:00
tonight's liquid is um chameleon cold brew chameleon cold brew yeah alrighty
same thing for font weight for font weight uh here we have uh a number 700
so when you go get those fonts from google fonts you can specify the weight
you can see that i have the 300 400 and 700 here so i can actually set the
weight to one of those three different weights based on the font that i got as
well all right and as always if there's something that you
don't know how to do at css the quickest
way to doing it or learning it is to use the mdn you can just google what you
want to do css mdn and it'll pop right up there for you i i forget so much
stuff when it comes to css so many weird things that i want to do that i always
just have the mdn open and i just go right to it uh the mdn has saved my butt
so many times it's the best resource just to do quick lookups to find what

01:01
you need uh so yeah all right we are at the top of the hour uh when we come
back from our break we're gonna get our hands on the keyboard and be working
through some basic css we're gonna get just a little bit more review and then
we're gonna get to the new stuff so if you're new here we like to be healthy we
like to make sure that we take breaks at the top of the hour we're to be here to
be software engineers for the rest of our careers uh so let's go ahead if
you're able get up move around please get up from your keyboard go kiss some
babies go go look out the window so your eyes can focus on something that's
that's not so close right all right we bring up the timer here
play some tunes and i'll be back too i'll see you all in five
you too youtubers if you're watching on youtube take your five minute break just
because we're not live doesn't mean you're not taking your breaks okay

01:05
and i'll give you all what you want e did leon build the bingo no that was
cross and the diabolical which uh there well dab is part of our stream team

01:06
and so when you do exercise point bingo you see it says in the creative minds of
the follicle and across put bob back on i love bob oh dab's here hey
what's my favorite movie i actually have a list of all my
favorite movies uh and i i kind of keep it to a top five um
i guess i could share the full top five and they kind of rotate into now
depending on how i'm feeling birdman is really close to the top top right now
but there's a i have a full list princess bard is pretty up there yeah
top five anime i do watch anime but i don't watch i don't i don't watch anime
like that though you know what i'm saying like i watch anime but i don't
watch it like i don't like you know back in the day i did though

01:07
like before it was like cool because when i was like when you were like the
weird kid yeah that was me too mainstream these days staying up late on uh
at a friend's house because they had cartoon network just to catch the bebops
all right folks come on back come on back [Laughter]
clark said you're still a weird kid bro thank you i think that i like that

01:08
respect thank you tsunami exactly now see here's how here's here's how like
if you're in your 30s and you did this one thing it's how i
know we could be friends so back in my day gather around
gather around my fire here back in my day we used to go into aol chat rooms
uh that were labeled dbc our dbz rp and in these dbz rp uh aol chat rooms
uh we would use the roll dice commands uh to make moves as our favorite dragon
ball z characters and then we would role play out these epic battles uh in aol
chat rooms that all came down to these like actual
dice rolls so if you ever did that back in the day

01:09
you were you were my speed we could be friends all right
let's get our fingers on the keyboard here let's get our fingers on the keyboard
here and uh let's let's look at some basic css so we're going to code some
basic css if you need the materials today all right you need the materials today
uh they are on our discord exclamation point discord or leon noel.com discord
we have a follow along materials channel
where all the materials that you need to download for today are
so in that folder we have a few specific folders one is this basic css 2
which is very similar to what we did on thursday but it's not the same one basic
css2 and in this there's an html file and there is a css file

01:10
if you look in the html there are some comments and these comments
ask you to do different things one says make the lis blue underline 15 pixels
and have a gray background some actually do height
some ask you to use fonts and so i'm going to give you all four minutes
four minutes on the clock and then we're gonna go over it it together so four
minutes on the clock i'll bring out some tunes i won't share anything important
i'm just gonna answer your questions as you're working on this
uh and then we'll go over it together formats you can't get all through it in
four minutes don't worry it's just so that we can go over it together too
all right so give your best hundred devs try in these four minutes and we'll go

01:11
over it together this is the basic css2 basic css yep basic css two
uh let's bump up the five let's bump it to five minutes five minutes we'll do
five minutes just because i know some folks it's just so that you don't get too
too in the weeds that way you know that in five minutes you come back and do it
together so get as far as you can go in these five minutes bring up some tunes
for you about it materials again are yep the css is empty exactly
you're working on the basic css2 the html is there but the css is not
you're looking at blank files make sure you've unzipped your folder [Laughter]

01:12
uh southpaw it is in the follow-on materials channel
what do you do to reward yourself after pomodoro
uh i just take a break i used to do like really like intense rewards
uh but now just the breaks enough for me my brain
is okay with that sometimes i do animate door i think that's fun or like
um tv doro yeah we are building out the css or the basic css2 folder yeah
css is blank because you're writing the css
uh in the html file there it tells you what to do please make the lis blue
please make the section of a height and then you write the css to make this

01:13
happen i'll leave it like this and people can see what we're working on
yeah no classes no ids yep the instructions are in the html
yep exactly if you don't know how to do it look up in the mdn

01:14
then we'll go over it together what's going on ed
do you think having technical knowledge would help applying for product
management roles in tech yeah can't hurt right
my best pms have always known how to code
not that it's a requirement but the ones i've enjoyed have known how to code
i play d and d now winter is coming yeah how do i comment out stuff in css you
can just highlight it and then do command forward slash or control forward slash

01:15
two more minutes of vomit exactly no just wait until we go over it together yeah
can pianos make more than devs um not i mean sometimes i guess right
but that's what you want to do and what company
lost right now hey we're gonna go over it together don't worry
you can't download the files i would try to find some other way to do it you

01:16
don't have to download them to the computer you can download them to
like a google drive or something like that too
this is fun hey i'm glad you think so my colors are so off of flux yeah
all right folks come on back come on back i know that you might not have gone
all the way to the end that's okay let's go over and do it together
let's do it together all right what i always do come on back do it together
uh what i always do is i i just open my entire class folder so i unzipped the
class 5 materials and then i just drag that whole unzip folder to vs code and
the reason why i do that is because i get this lovely tree view with all of
the projects we're going to work on today i don't have to worry about like

01:17
opening and closing other projects you just open it right cool
because look at this um please make the allies blue underline
15 pixels and have a gray background instead of having to like swap back and
forth i'm just going to copy this and then go to my css and then put that there
and in fact i'm probably gonna do that for all of them yep let me grab it boom
and what i'm doing here to make these comments is i'm just highlighting my
text and then for me it's command forward slash for you it might be
control forward slash um it's up to you uh i don't like split some folks do
and i think it's just kind of showing my process so i'll do the first three for
now and then we'll come back to the other ones cool beautiful
all right please make the allies blue underline 50 pixels and have a gray

01:18
background all right so i'm going to target my li
select my lis here and let's go ahead and make them blue color blue nice
underline what's the property for underline don't worry about feeling slow
all right this is this is class five this is class five you have plenty of
time to pick up speed you're you gotta think of yourself as like a a a big train
a luxurious you're a luxury liner luxury liners take a little while to get up to
speed nobody wants to nobody wants to ride the
metro they want to ride the luxury liner right and sometimes you guys it takes a
while to get up to speed you know you gotta think of yourself a little bit
more highly the better trains take a while to get up
to speed all right text decoration and we'll do underline cool
and then we're going to do font size of 15 pixels cool

01:19
and then we're going to have a gray background so background gray cool
how can i open this in the browser how can i see my css taking effect
what are some things i could do with uh with css3 we didn't need we
don't need the hyphenated colors anymore make sure it's saved yep so it is saved
and then from my html file i'm going to open in browser cool
there we go we can see that we got the gray background the underline it's blue
all right looking it's looking real good right looking real good right all right
next one please make this section have a height
of 300 pixels a light purple background and a gold border let's look

01:20
this section are there any other sections no
so we don't have to worry about like doing any type of selector here that's
anything more than just the section there are no other sections we course
don't need classes or ids for this we don't need anything other than hey just
a section so let's go ahead and just target the section cool
uh let's give it a height of 300 pixels 300 pixels nice
uh a light purple background uh what did you all use for a light purple
would you all use for light purple plum plum i was gonna grab one of y'all's
rgba values here factual factual sunshine i'm putting a lot of
faith in you right here a lot of faith and uh fractal sunshine here let's see

01:21
let's see how if they did us dirty or not oh like it was a good one
i got you got the little you get the little to get the little preview here so
i can see that they they didn't lead us astray
lavender is one i think a lot of people wouldn't have used all right we've got
the rgb in here uh and a gold border that is five pixels thick
goldberg is five pixels thick so let's go ahead and do border
and then we'll do 5 pixels solid and then gold cool
all right let's save this let's make sure this works looks good too
oh beautiful look at us go look at us go it's gonna bother me no all right

01:22
let's go ahead and do the next one here please make this h1 30 pixels gold
centered and use source sans pro stands pro all right
does the order for border matter try it out see if it breaks or not
it's an easy one to try out right for a lot of those like simple ones try see if
it breaks all right h1 is our selector here uh
let's give it a font size of 30 pixels cool let's make it color gold nice
uh centered how'd y'all do your centering what did y'all do to center
next the line i like that one for now text align
cool center beautiful and then use source sans pro fonts we're going to

01:23
need the font family and we'll do source stands pro source sans pro
let's give it a fall back of sans serif just in case
and do we have source sans pro yet do we have source stands pro no
let's go ahead and get our source sans pro fonts.google.com uh
don't want any of the roboto let's do source sans there we go
thank you paul d hunt and i was going to grab the 400 for now
and i'm going to grab my link i'm going to throw that in
my head above my css link cool and now we should have source sans pro

01:24
yep we should have source dance pro now and everything else should be here as
well let's go ahead and grab the last two here
there were no other h1 so not to worry about like a more advanced selector
we need to worry about the footer and we need to make the text have a line
through it for the h2 so boop i go ahead and highlight this there we go
all right and all right make this footer so we're going to target the footer
beautiful uh remember look what i do every single
time hold on i'm going to delete i'm going to do a little bit slower ready
look right next to my head look right there i'm going to oh wait
i'm a little little nice little soccer headbutt there uh

01:25
watch what i do with my footer ready order i get my curly braces all right
get my curly braces i break them all right i break them right i want to
kiss it sometimes right you break them all right and the idea here is that
i want to to make sure that i never forget to close my curly braces right
make sure i never forget to close them uh one of the biggest things that folks
always get in trouble with is they didn't save they didn't refresh right
and they forgot to close their curly braces so always open them always close
them and then start doing your actual declarations right
as always we're going to go through this a little bit fast this one's definitely
review everything here we've done before in a past class so if it's going a
little too fast for you that's okay i will always share the files after
class and the vod is always immediately available after class as well if you

01:26
watch the vod you look at the solution file and it still doesn't make sense get
on the help channels in discord and we can help you through it right so
i think where a lot of folks mess up is they're like frantically trying to copy
along right they're frantically trying to copy
along don't frantically copy along make sure you're digesting make sure you're
watching make sure you're asking questions right video von means video on
demand it's the video that's live here on twitch right after class right
and so don't worry about like frantically typing along you're always
going to get the solution afterwards so take your five minutes if you didn't get
it done focus on walking through it together all right
all right footer should have a dark brown background which you all use for
dark brown let's see i'm gonna grab one all right aaron ender

01:27
let's see if aaron ender did us right all right we're going to do our color
or sorry background background and uh the biggest yeah just full rgb
all right there we go we got like a dark brown i don't know there's
it's brown i don't know if i would say dark brown it's brown though we'll take
it uh dark brown 300 pixels in height cool and then 70 width so so geez with 70
wonderful all right we got our background dark brown thank
you aaron we got a height 300 pixels and a width of 70 percent
cool and then there was one other thing that was here it was to make the h2 have
a line through it how'd y'all do your line through on the h2

01:28
what'd you do for your line through yep cool text decoration line through
beautiful let's see our beautiful creation let's see our beautiful creation
you ready for this perfection look at it just look at it look at it got the
beautiful centering hello twitch you got the the nice dark brown thank
you to aaron we got the line through on mixer looking good
i think i could be a designer what do you think
nuns would be proud the nuns be proud i think so all right vomit gang
alrighty as always the solution will be on discord as soon as class is over

01:29
uh when we're going through this don't frantically try to type along just just
enjoy it ask questions let's go through it together then you'll have the code
after class as well alright let's move on talked about talking about some
relationships last class talked about that our relationships uh
can can help us target or select certain elements uh in our css well in our html
via our css so here we have a direct parent child
meaning that we have to select something that is immediately inside of a parent
and so whenever you see this right carrot you're saying find me a paragraph
that is immediately inside of a section and that's what we see here
right and that's what we see here we see a paragraph that is immediately inside

01:30
of a section we also talked about a parent child selector where it doesn't
have to be immediately it could be any level deep right so here we're saying
find a paragraph that is at some level right that is at some level inside
of a section right find me something that's at some level inside of a section
cd uh with css3 you just don't need the hyphens anymore right and so the idea
here is that we're looking over here we see a paragraph what is the direct child
of this paragraph what is the direct child of this
paragraph i mean sorry the direct parent of this paragraph
the direct parent of this paragraph is the article
but it's still inside of a section that still makes it a child of a section it's
just not the immediate the direct parent here the section is the direct parent

01:31
here the direct parent is the article and the paragraph is just a grandchild
of the section we also have uh direct sibling right or
the the the the sibling uh where you're looking for a paragraph that is
immediately coming after a sibling paragraph right and so here this
paragraph has an immediate sibling that is another paragraph
now we can tell that both of these are siblings how how are they both siblings
why are they siblings same parent exactly they're inside the same parent
if if we like got rid of this indentation does anything change
if we got rid of the indentation does anything change

01:32
no nothing changes they're still children it's just it just doesn't look as good
we didn't put enough respect on their name right and so we do the indentation
to make our lives a lot easier but that indentation especially in html white
space doesn't really matter that much and so we put that indentation to show a
little respect make a little bit easier for us to see these parent-child
relationships but it's not really doing anything okay oh
i forgot to show this to y'all let me see if i can pull it up real
quick hold on one second one second give me a second here let's see projects
wrap apps so i showed this before in my free time i like to build really

01:33
dumb apps and um here is one uh it's part of a series of rap apps that i've been
building for a very long time i got a lot of these i've showed a
couple of them on stream before but i got a lot of them like
20 plus of them no problem maybe maybe closer to 30.
and the goal is eventually i'm gonna release them all and the first person to
make it through all of them is gonna get an amazon gift card
and so how do you solve this like do you
click birdman no do you like look at his name like what do you what do you do so
only if you like know some stuff about like hip hop or rap
you would know what to do so what what do you do here
you gotta put respect on his name exactly so you put respect on his name
and then there you go so if you don't put respect on his name

01:34
it does it doesn't it doesn't get solved right uh there's another one here um
this is another one i showed before i'm only gonna show ones i've showed before
because i don't want people to do it uh so this is chief keefe
and you have to remember all the stuff that they don't like and so
until you figure out like all the stuff they don't like it just his face will
just keep shifting back and forth but if you remember all the things that they
don't like then you can check and it'll take you to the next one um
i think this is the right one this one's hard
because you only get one try like i think some folks will just get to this
one and they'll click randomly and then then it's done
they can't they can't continue uh what do you think this one is for

01:35
folks that folks that haven't seen it yeah so this is a lyrical lemonade video
uh and this of course is the one with blueface baby in it so you would have to
click on the blueface baby right you don't click on blueface baby
everything else everything else will just stop you from being able to
continue so you get one shot at clicking on blueface baby that's it
yeah i think i think i've shown one or two more on stream but i don't wanna
yeah i'm gonna stop here because this this will hopefully go out within like a
month or two nah like probably like three more months i got a lot of them
that i want to finish uh so yeah when i'm not on discord
and i'm not at work that's what that's what i'm probably working [Laughter]
on all right let's code some relationships let's code some relationships
so in that same set of code from tonight

01:36
uh there is a relationship css to folder and if you click on the html
you get a bunch of the relationships that we saw from last class
and then inside the css there are uh four things that i would
like for you to try and do all right four things that i would like for you to
try and do so there is there is an html file in the
relationship css2 and then in the css file there are four four kind of things
i would like for you to do uh and that's the relationship css to
folder cool all right let me bring up the timer here we're going to do four
minutes on this one and then of course we'll go over it together
why is there js folder for the engagement thank you for the engagement

01:37
we're not using js all right good luck my screen's not blurry make sure you
adjust the quality setting you have uh we're lucky to have quality
settings you can turn up the quality if you like on your own
if you all need the materials um you can go to our discord exclamation
point discord and in the follow along materials channels
all the materials we're using for tonight yeah refreshing can help a lot um
turning it off the auto needle that could work too yeah refreshing or
turning off auto can help a lot doing good deck hey how you doing

01:38
120 i don't like to do that so i don't yeah the last one's a little tricky
uh what's the name of the opening browser plugin open in browser
i think it's called tech what's it called tech er i think it was yeah tech er
i don't think you've seen my terminal yet i use a couple different ones
actually though i term i think is when i showed y'all

01:39
no other plug-ins for now soy get used to using everything manually get used to
moving around your your files your folders happy wednesday engineer
you finished nice boom got a lot of folks coming in done nice
well some folks got through this one did you all use classes and ids because
it says at the top no classes no ids making sure make sure you make make sure
you pay attention to the rules here i wonder if you're stuck we're gonna go

01:40
over it together our pseudo class is allowed uh you can
do without pseudo classes there's a way to do without pseudo classes
what are classes and ideas there are ways of adding more specificity to your
selector we're going to see them in a minute i go over those so if you weren't
here for last class i'm actually going to go over that as soon as we're done
this one beat the time nice please open again slowly i just drag my
folder to vs code that's all i do to open it like i drag my folder to the vs
code icon and opens up uh you can always open vs code and then open your folder

01:41
it's up to you you have a favorite resource to learn vs
code no i just google the stuff i don't i need to do i don't really like to add
stuff to my text editors that much um so i don't really customize them too
while is there something i need to change i just google how to do it
all right let's go over this together folks alrighty
all right please make only world and zebra blue let's look at world in zebra
uh both world and zebra are h2s inside of a section
uh we also have these other h2s that are inside of a section so what do we know
we need to do to target the world in zebra but not unicorn and hufflepuff
yeah we need that that parent the direct parent child so we can go ahead and do

01:42
section space h2 and then do color blue cool
let's open this in the browser and make sure that it's working
yep so we only got world in zebra's blue it's a little bit bigger
only world in zebra blue nice because if we look world and zebra are
direct children of this section where as unicorn and hufflepuff are
direct children of the article they're grandchildren of the section so that's
why we can't just do section space we have to use the right carrot cool
please make only zebra purple uh oh how'd you make only zebra purple

01:43
well you can't do h2 plus h2 if you do h2 plus h2 that would also make
hufflepuff purple right so we got we got to get a little
wild here we gotta go down here and maybe do section h2 plus h2 right
and then make that color purple let's see let's see if we get purple
all right we got it cool all right so what happened here
what was this an example of what what just happened here chat
cascade exactly this is the cascade in effect right they both were blue
but as we went down the cascade this selector on line seven
made this rule have the three points of specificity that enabled us to override

01:44
that second h2 from being blue i just forgot my semicolon here uh from
being blue to being purple right we used that cascade to our effect
and so we wanted to target just that second h2 how did that work right if we
go back and look this h2 has an immediate sibling that's this h2
and they're both direct children of the section
right so we're able to say all right h2 was zebra
it was an immediate sibling of world and
they were both direct descendants of the section right
why doesn't h2 plus h2 make them both purple because this is saying the the
direct sibling so it means it has to have another sibling before it right if
we go back and look does world have another sibling that comes before it no

01:45
this world doesn't have another h2 if there's an h2 up here then yes right cool
seven minutes that's that's a different type of any any child select sorry any
uh sibling it's any sibling we're not gonna we're gonna skip that
for now cause i want people to get too confused
all right let's take a look at the next one please make only hufflepuff gold
how can you make only hufflepuff gold so here's unicorn
here's hufflepuff how do i target just hufflepuff ah
so it's kind of the same pattern again right like if we just did h2s it could

01:46
target both unicorn and hufflepuff so if i do h2 plus h2
inside of an article inside of a section that'll differentiate it from the other
ones right or we could just do inside of article 2 right and so oh we can't just
do inside of article uh well we could maybe because we have
one down here but let's think about we do h2 plus h2
inside of article and i think we should we think we got it let's try it
so article then we do h2 plus h2 and we're going to go ahead and make it gold
right so the idea here being that we're saying all right give me the h2 who has
a sibling that's an h2 that is the direct child of an article
all right let's try that let's see let's see if that see if that happens there's
only hufflepuff turn gold let's see all right did i change anything in my html

01:47
all right let's see all right yeah only help turn gold nice now could
could we like could we have done more right
could we have done more could we have done like section article h2 plus h2 yes
we could have could have added more but you don't want to oh you don't want to
add more than you need does the white space matter uh the white
space mainly is for like making sure that you can understand what's happening
but a lot of times white space really just doesn't matter that much cool
we're actually gonna see that later we're gonna go full bore to see if we
can add as much specificity as possible no all right keep hufflepuff gold
and make only unicorn gray all right keep hufflepuff gold

01:48
and make only unicorn gray so let's go back and look at unicorn
unicorn is this h2 right is this h2 how can i make unicorn gray
but keep hufflepuff gold let's see if we can make make can we get
unicorn gray first all right let's try it uh if we do article h2
we make it color gray all right let's see what that does to
unicorn and hufflepuff we go back and we refresh
all right unicorn is gray although puffs stay gold but duck also turned gray

01:49
let's take a look at that can i get a little bit more specific maybe
if i get a little bit more specific though
well let's talk about let's start before we get more specific why didn't
why didn't hufflepuff turn gray unicorn turned gray but why didn't hufflepuff
yeah it has less specificity if we look at this rule here this rule has
how many points a specificity how many points
has three points specificity exactly and then how many points did this have
it had two so there's no way for stuff that gets
applied here to be overwritten by stuff that applies here that's why hufflepuff

01:50
stayed gold right there's three points of specificity on that second h2 when we
target all the h2s it's enough to turn unicorn to gray right
but it's not enough to also turn hufflepuff to gray
right this doesn't have enough to override the gold right all right
but we're still not out of the woods here yet because we're running into
something interesting and that's that duck duck is also turning gray and i don't
want that to happen i just want unicorn to be gray and i want hufflepuffs to be
gold so if we look how do i differentiate between
unicorn and hufflepuff and duck the section exactly
these ones are inside of a section as a grandchild

01:51
this one is not ever inside of a section so we can go back to our css
and say all right well section space article h2 right and if i do that
what's the weird thing that's going to happen though what's gonna happen here
we got unicorn gray but hufflepuff is back to gray
so what what could i do the cascade came into effect here it overrided this
rule up here what could i do i'm looking to see all your

01:52
i could get more specific i could do that right maybe we do this maybe if we do
well this hufflepuff was inside of a section right so maybe we just do
section article h2 plus h2 now how many points of specificity does
this rule have how many points of specificity does this rule have
so this has four right we get one for the h2 one for the h2
one for the article one for section that's four
and we get one for the h2 one for the article one for section that's three
so anything that happens in this rule cannot be overwritten by this rule so

01:53
if i make my sibling h2 gold i can't override it it's not working
why is it not working why is it not working the theory is correct
i didn't save it right if we look if we look dot
is still solid means i didn't save let's save let's come back
let's refresh boom unicorn hufflepuff well done well done chat you all did well
cool let's uh i mean there are other ways that we could have done this
ordering could have helped here we could have done things like classes and ids
you know i didn't want you to use them you could use pseudoselectors you know i
didn't want you to use them right so ordering could have also helped here but
uh we were able to get through it because we understood specificity and we

01:54
understood the cascade right so the idea that i want you to do
is after tonight's class like after we get done the raid after we spread our
love positivity and all the follows you got to come back and play with this
stuff you got to give yourself some more rules
right you got to give yourself some some some things that that are going to make
you have to put in some work right high cognitive effort right make sure that
you can start to see all right well the cascade might come into effect if
they're same or greater specificity we're going to get a lot of practice
with this stuff come to office hour we're going to get more practice with
this stuff but the idea is that you got to also push yourself a little bit right
give yourself some some odd things what if i want hufflepuff to be
purple but i also want zebra to be purple at the same time like can you do
it right alrighty let's review our specificity and our ids

01:55
and classes so so far we've used our relationships and for the rest of our
work tonight uh i still want you to focus on your
relationships i really don't want you to use classes or ids just yet
uh starting next class you want to start
using your classes and ideas go for it i just want you to get comfortable with
your relationship selectors first before you move on to classes and ids but
to hint at them so we can talk about specificity right talk about specificity
uh ids can be used once per element and then once you use that id name it
can never be shared on any other html element so if you look at this paragraph
it has the id of zebra this paragraph cannot have another id it can have
classes and other stuff but it can't have another id
and then that id of zebra cannot be used anywhere else in your html file

01:56
it's a unique identifier right it is a unique identifier
is it possible to build a fully fledged website without using a single class or
id you can but let's talk about it let's
hold that fault for just a second let me cover classes and ids again and then
hold that thought come back to it with it in just a few seconds right
can you create a whole website without classes and ids hold that let's hold
that thought in our head for a second ids are unique they can only be used once
right and they cannot be reused anywhere
else in that page it's like your discord username like the username with all the
numbers in it there's only one it cannot be reused and it's a way to talk to you
directly so when we see this id in our in our css it enables us to talk to that
paragraph and only that paragraph classes can be used to talk to multiple

01:57
elements at the same time maybe i want everyone with glasses to
stand up right or maybe i want everyone with great beards to stand up right and
so i could target multiple elements at the same time right to stand up
and so we can see that in our code here both of these paragraphs have the class
of bob right have the class of bob i can target both of those classes
at the same time i write one rule i wrote one rule in my css but i targeted both
of those paragraphs right so ids are unique classes can be reused across and it
enables us to target multiple elements okay now an a html element can have an id
and it can have as pretty much as many classes as you want um

01:58
there are people have like tested like you can there's like a theoretical limit
i'm sure there's a theoretical limit but you'll never ever ever hit that
theoretical limit in actual practice okay so people used to think it was like
255 but then somebody like tested it it was way more than 255
but the idea here is that ids are unique classes can be reused all right
now somebody asked me before we get to our specificity game somebody asked me
leon can you have a whole site that does not use classes and ids and
let's take let's take a look at our html that we had here
this whole site works without any classes and ids and i could
build a whole website like a beautiful website that just used all these
relationships but there's something that could happen
and here's what could happen some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] could come along

01:59
right they could come along and put a section just a section
they could put a section and when they put that section what happens
we throw hands in them it breaks everything right it breaks
everything if you have these like nice meticulous
relationship selectors right the relationship is over right as soon as
somebody throws that section there this relationship is over right all [Music]
all of the relationships that you put in all that hard work all the section h2
plus h2s all these section articles h2s right like all those things would just
break so while yes you could do a whole site just

02:00
with relationship selectors it only takes one person to add one
other element to break all your hard work and so for that reason we don't
build sites with just relationship selectors i typically will have classes
on most of my containing elements and then i'll use relationships inside of
those classes i'm one of the weirdos that i don't
think i'm a weirdo anymore i think a lot of people have moved this way i don't
really use ids for css i'll use ids when i get to
javascript but they're too rich they have too much specificity so i avoid ids
i use classes on my containers and then when i want to target stuff inside those
containers i use my relationship selectors yeah
can we explain containing elements containing elements are just elements

02:01
that contain other stuff sections articles headers footers cool alrighty folks
we are at the top of the hour when we come back we're gonna get some
specificity practice in and then we are going to do um
i think it's a really fun getting our fingers on the keyboard we're gonna try
and make some ridiculous selectors when we come back so we're gonna do we're
gonna play guess that specificity no peeking ahead and then we are going to
build some ridiculous selectors just to see what we can do together get our
fingers back on them keyboards and uh yeah but for now if you're new around
these parts like to stay healthy we like
to make sure we take our breaks so we're gonna take our five minute break uh
please if you're able get up move around hydrate and uh we'll be back in five
minutes five minutes on the clock here cool

02:06
i'll bring out some tunes for you and i'll see you all in five
you what's between ux and ui ux is like how you move through an application uis
like the things that you interact with and see
so user experience versus user interface as we went over clear fix on during
office hours so definitely re-watch that that vod i
think a bunch of people have like posted timestamps to it uh in in discord but
when we get to more layout stuff we'll definitely go over it in class
leon is studying five hours a day too much too little i want to avoid burnout
it's up to you uh some people have the ability to study
for five hours a day most don't most people just don't

02:07
for a lot of people that's aspirational um most people have like two to three
like a real like focus a day um but it's a really it's a really
personal thing it's something you can always build up to too if you're not
there i totally did not start with my pomodoros i'm able to do now and
the amount of work i'm able to do it took me a long time to build up to it
you gotta do what you gotta do what feels best
i think a good goal in the beginning is two hours a day
and then some days you might feel a bit better and a little bit longer but i i
would start there as a good goal outside of class that is too
all right folks come on back come on back
we're gonna have a huge party after this i hope so
hopefully the the world is situated in a way that we could do meetups and stuff
like that larry thank you for the gifted sub thank you to all the subs today too

02:08
a lot of folks using the the jeff bezos's money i appreciate all the prime
subs you have amazon prime you can uh sub for free and so i appreciate you
spending all bezos's money oh mastermind what's going on how you doing
thank you return gifted sauce hold on y'all following mastermind you
all messed up i can't wait to hopefully catch you live
so we can send a rager away but mastermind is the one i keep talking
about folks if you want to do more data sciencey stuff they're the person to
follow um they were also running a boot camp
that was that was pretty cool to watch they were in person but streaming it uh
in person it was really cool hope you're doing well thank you for stopping by
i'll uh i'll send out the the link so that you
all can follow their channel and then we're definitely gonna have to do a raid

02:09
as soon as possible appreciate it hope you're doing well all right folks
get back in here everyone's throwing up the primes thank you
as always the the the subs and all that stuff goes to nonprofit i work at the
during the day directly to our emergency fund and so i appreciate that
time to work exactly alrighty let's take a look
at specificity let me show the music here alrighty so
let's play our favorite game at the moment
guess that specificity how many points of specificity does this rule here have

02:10
how many points guesses in chat please all right seeing 21 21 21 21 exactly
we get uh 10 points for the unicorn another 10 points for robot because
they're both classes and then one point for the paragraph
right so we get 21 points of specificity there
two classes right two classes and a tag for 21 points 31 20.
let's do another one here how many points of specificity does this rule have
all right 110 in chat i see it so we get

02:11
one point sorry ten points for the class and a hundred points for the id
so we had one id one class zero tags or a hundred and ten points of nice and
how many points specificity does this rule have oh a lot of y'all got got
a lot of y'all got got it's all right though a lot of y'all got
y'all are spending bezos's money i appreciate it
it's so wild there's so many of you what hold on one second that's
ridiculous mastermind started off with the 10 gifted thank you so much

02:12
and then minimal spot grammar ban booze htb yv0 uh julia nan wes kai

sorrows joe talon knox major manny jf it's just so i can't there's too many
holy crap thank you so much everybody i gotta figure out like

02:13
i gotta figure out how to to to say thank you more regularly but it's
just so many that just came in uh i appreciate you all
i definitely see you all come in mo gabriel thank you for the for the five
gift it that's wild uh if you if you now have if you now have
micro leons like the emotes put some emotes in chat for us please i would
love to see the emotes that's pretty cool that's wild and as always please
never have to sub none of my content overview behind paywalls
uh the the primes you see you're coming in are just free if you have amazon
prime you get a free sub so i appreciate it i'll get all the emotes ah
y'all looking good at me thank you everybody alrighty uh so this was
a got got moment because you were right there are 10
points of specificity in the selector right there are 10 points of specificity

02:14
in the selector but then but then boom the bang important adds a thousand
points of specificity right so a thousand and ten
i'm going to get a call from amazon leon you got to slow down
you got to slow down you're burning through our resources here leon what are
you doing too much too much of bezos's money i'm going to get a call right from
the big man themselves i appreciate it's wild
so a thousand points from the important all right and 10 points for the
class so a thousand points zero ids one class zero tags a thousand and ten
points of specificity boom all right let's get some specificity
practice this one i i love this one all right this would be pretty fun
uh i like this one a lot it's one of my favorite early things that we do so

02:15
let's look at this one specificity practice in the same materials from
today if you're new as always the materials are on our discord exclamation
point discord right exhibition point discord can you have two bang importance
i don't think so but it's worth trying i never thought to do that
i don't know we'll try it all right i think i think you only get one yeah
some people are saying no but i always like to test those things you just never
know there's so much funky stuff in css you just never know some things i
thought and then like in a million years i'd never be possible to do it and i
tried i'm like all right so we have in the same
materials from today they're on discord in the following materials channel uh we
have specificity specificity practice uh index.html has a lot of stuff going
on in here look at all these classes uh look at some of these ids and then
inside the css is what we're going to do okay so

02:16
specificity practice folder you see the html has all these classes and ids and
then the style.css has four things that i would like for you to do
and so go ahead and i'm gonna put four minutes on the timer
and while out on these ones please uh have fun with the last two
and go for it four minutes on the timer and we're gonna go over it together so
get as far as you can in the four minutes you get done throw it down in the chat
ender's like done we're gonna go over it together i'll
bring the tunes on for you can we use ids and classes this time yes

02:17
you can use ids and classes on this one this is specifically practice with our
classes and ids yeah thank you for asking though
which one are we doing we are doing the specificity practice and the things that
you have to do are in um in the style sheet
uh engineer bay yes you can of course figure to be true seems like a trap i
hope so i say you know you're doing it right people are fishy

02:18
no worry boards we're going to go over it together ah by select i mean give a um
write a selector with the highest level specificity that you can do
the highest level you can do yeah oh no sorry computer crashed
worlds i do of course [Laughter] no no no zebra blue is not a color like
i want you to style the words rhino and zebra blue there's no there's no color

02:19
called zebra blue that's funny i didn't think about that
if i select i mean make a selector yeah as part of your css rule
right right right dragging it feeling lost it's not working make sure
you saved you refreshed yep make sure that you close your curly braces
could you show the point slide or between this one
one point for tags 10 points for classes 100 point for ids a thousand for other

02:20
yep don't forget to send me coins exactly
how do we handle classes with spaces in the name they're not spaces they're two
separate classes that's a really great question those are actually two separate
classes i'll be sure we walk through that gasp
i switch up every once in a while you know all right folks come on in
come on in let's come back no matter if you finished or not don't worry come on
back let's go through it together it's a great song meal alrighty

02:21
let's take a look at this one together alrighty
all right make only rhino and zebra blue so if we look
we've seen a lot of interesting things here and somebody actually asked about
this this is this is two separate classes
right this is two separate classes this this h2 has the class of africa
and the class of four legs which makes sense for a rhino same thing here this
this zebra has the class of africa and the class of four legs right so a
lot of times maybe you want to style things with multiple classes right if if
you were looking at me i would have the class of glasses i
would have the class of amazing hair i would have a class of amazing beard i
have a class of pokemon t-shirt right like i have lots of classes that

02:22
describe me that i would then want to be able to put those attributes on other
people right i'd want to be able to make sure that other people could have
glasses other people could have great hair other people could have great
beards other people could have well i don't know if they could have
the the pokemon worlds t-shirt but maybe
they could maybe they could right uh and so classes can be reused right classes
can be reused and multiple elements might have right might have
uh those those classes cool alrighty so let's take a look at this we want to
make we want to make rhino and zebra what do we want to do to them
we're going to make only ryan and zebra blue so if we look does anything else
have those classes no nothing else has those classes so i
could target it by the ids i could say id and zebra right so i could do

02:23
something like this i could do rhino and i could say color blue
right and then i could do zebra and color blue right if we look
rhino has the idea of rhino and zebra has the idea of zebra right
and so i i could i could do those two ids right
a cool thing that i could do is i could also just do this
right that comma means target both of them at the same time right or
if i didn't want to use the ids a lot of folks are looking in here both of these
h2s are inside the section that has the class of top

02:24
right so maybe i could do let's see class of top
and then just the h2s inside of it right so every h2
that's inside of something that has the class of top so if we look
both of these are h2s and they're inside of a section that has
the class of top so this should work yup rhino and zebra are blue cool
yep the the octo thorpe or hashtag is what we use for ids cool
um the thing here says only right says only that's a very specific word only
right is there a chance if we were to add other css

02:25
sorry add other html that this would only make rhino and zebra blue
only is a very specific word here there's a chance if we came here and
added another h2 inside of this section that this would no longer only target
right rhino and zebra so i think because of the word only that kind of makes it
forces our hand a little bit here and so i'm going to comment this out so it's
still here if you come back and want to look at this code after class but i
think this is only we kind of have to go with the
the the um targeting the ids right like in case some person comes along and adds
another h2 i want to make sure that we're targeting only them um what color
was supposed to be blue right only those two why not select the classes that's a
great question well could something else

02:26
come along that has africa and four legs right could something else come along
could i create another h2 that also has those classes yeah
can i create another h2 that has either of these ids no
right so the ids are the only sure bet to satisfy this only word here right
yeah be a little nitpicky here but i think i think it's just a fun exercise
to talk through it right make only hufflepuff gold let's go and
take a look at hufflepuff how can i target only hufflepuff
best house oh i'm glad you all agree thank you yes hufflepuff is indeed the
best house thank you oh you meant the id best house okay yep

02:27
best house would be how we would target hufflepuff i'm glad we all agree though
so let's go ahead and do best house with the id and [Laughter]
let's make it gold and i know all of the
harry potter fans are freaking out right
now i know it's not gold it's okay we're gonna make it through this
see i'm a hufflepuff with a gryffindor rising and so that's why i threw gold in
here all right let's go ahead and save this and let's go back and check
beautiful a little bit bigger so we can see hufflepuff is only gold

02:28
that worked nice next one please select duck
with the highest level specificity i love these so much please select duck
with the highest level specificity possible throw uh throw your
your um guesses in chat just so i can see this this this monstrosity
uh so people keep saying how do we handle classes with spaces you cannot
have a class with a space as soon as you put a space in your class
that's two separate classes right and so um there there are none so
right here this uh best house has the class of harry potter it has the class
of triwizard champ and it has the class of badger
those are three separate classes cool all right

02:29
right we can we can stop spamming the the guess is here
all right let's take a look at these let's let's do one together here's
here's duck all right at the base level duck has how many classes
how many classes does duck have has two so let's start there likes to quack
and fight 10 or 100. so let's go ahead and copy those two classes
and if i wanted to target it with the most specificity possible i can do this h2
likes to quack and then fight 10 or uh 100. so notice what i did here
notice how there is no space here when there is no space what you are saying
is find me something that has all of them right so what i'm saying here is i'm

02:30
saying find me an h2 that has the class likes to quack
and the class fight 10 or 100 right no spaces means find something
that has all of these right if i was to put a space here
what would that mean if i did that if i put a space there what would that mean
that makes exactly that makes it a parent child
relationship then we're going to be looking for something that has the class
fight 10 or 100 that's inside of an h2 that has the class likes the quack so we
can't have the space there because that's a parent child relationship
right right it's a parent-child relationship right cool
so here it's not a parent-type relationship we're looking for the h2 that has

02:31
this class and this class and is an h2 right let's just make this a color just
so we can see it um uh let's color lime there we go
cool let's just make sure that that's there
all right and we can see that duck is that nice green
right you see that duck is that nice green look at it there we go and so this
is not the most specificity we're just getting started
all right so it's an h2 with two classes what is this h2 with two classes inside
of it we go back and look this h2 with two classes is inside of an article

02:32
right since i have an article that has the class r ducks dinosaurs right
so now we gotta we gotta handle this this parent-child relationship
so now we have to do article our ducks dinosaurs
maybe maybe we'll be even more exact here with the the right carrot right so
now we're saying all right it's gonna get ridiculous i'm telling
you it's gonna get ridiculous right what i was saying is find me an h2
that has the class of likes to quack and the class of fight 10 or 100 that is
immediately inside of an article that has the class are ducks dinosaurs
does capitalization matter try it break it on your end see what happens
all right now this article how do we get even more

02:33
ridiculous how can we how can we keep this going
what is this article like well we know it's inside of a body in an html so we
got to go there but what what comes before we get to the body or the html
this article is a what this article is a sibling
this article is a sibling this article is a sibling to this section that has
the class of middle so i'm going to use that i'm going to say section
with the class of middle that is this it's the sibling so give me
the article that's the sibling to the section with the class of middle
and uh this section with the class of middle is a sibling to that section
that has the class of top so we gotta we gotta do that too so you gotta do

02:34
section with the class of top that's also a sibling and then
the sibling to the section with the class of top is the h1 with the id of high
all right so we got to do h1 with the id of high normally you would never ever
do this like h1 id high because normally when
we're not being uh wild lads today right when we're we're not we're not walling
out here um we uh we would just use the id the id is already specific enough
right all right already specific enough right and so what we're doing is
being ridiculous all right so we said find me h2 that has the class of likes

02:35
to quack and the class fight 10 or 100 that is the immediate child
of an article with the class r ducks dinosaurs
that is the sibling of section with the class of middle which is the sibling a
section with the class of top which is the sibling of the h1 with the id of high
and then that's all inside the body that's a child
and then all that's inside the html so html body
and uh i haven't even reached my final form folks what am i missing

02:36
stack that vomit bang important baby all right let's save it see if it works
the works first try let's go no he didn't i did folks i went there bangers only
all right let's take a look at it cool so this h2 which had those two classes
was inside this article which had that class which was a sibling to the section
with this class which was the sibling to the section with this class which was
the sibling to the h1 with this id that was the child of the body which was the
child of the html and then we gave it bang important and it worked
how many points is specificity go ahead and take a second how many points of

02:37
specificity how many points of specificity over nine 000. too many
all right let's take a look all right 10 20 21 21 21 31 32. yep 42 43 53 54 154

02:38
155 156 157 plus the bang important hundred and fifty seven did i count it
right all right chat spamming it too nice
well done everybody well done all right now there's another one down here
uh rhino with the highest level specificity do that one for homework please
now you've seen the the the wildness that we can have up here uh go ahead and
do this one for homework for me we're not gonna do it right now we'll go over it
during office hours but yeah do this one for homework for me cool
we got some important matters to attest to for the rest of this evening
my brain just puked all right thank you for playing along i
know i know it's funny but it does help you kind of visualize what you can do
all right let's talk about the box model and get
into some layout and then we'll we'll end for the the evening
all right something really important for

02:39
you to know about how html and css works is that every single thing
in web development is a box everything's a box
everything is trying to take up space uh
horizontal and vertical space when we're talking about the box model uh so
everything is a box i don't care if it's a piece of text i don't care if it's a
section everything is a box and so the box model is concerned with
how does that take up space what and rhyme and reason and logic behind why
things take up space and the reason why this matters is because we eventually
want to have like stuff sit next to other things we want to have stuff be
inside of other stuff and if we don't know how much space things are
taking up we can't sit stuff next to each other we can't put stuff inside and

02:40
so we are going to start with trying to understand the box model all right
let's pretend oh not pretend let's just do it let's go ahead and
let's make a section let me let me get some black text here
let's go ahead and create a section and that section is going to have a height
of 100 pixels and a width of 100 pixels cool and so if we drew that out
we would see [Music] a nice square box all right nice square box all but
all y'all primer's got the uh the emotes i see a lot of nuns in chat
tonight don't blame me blame the nuns all right

02:41
so we would have a nice square box height of the 100 pixels 100 pixels chat
my curly braces are not closed i'm going to add more yeah let me just close them
all the way down here there we go curly brace closed um
how wide is my is my section right now i promise the curly brace is closed
right there how wide is it 100 pixels wide how tall is it 100 pixels tall
if i was to put let's say i had an article that i wanted
to put these sections inside of right and my article was 300 pixels wide
how many of these sections could fit in my article
if my article is 300 pixels wide how many of these sections right now
could fit inside three exactly three of these could fit all right
when it comes to the box model there are three really important things

02:42
going horizontally we have width then we have padding and then we have border
and then going vertically we have height padding border right if we look at this
image you can you can see it here in the slides right you can see that we have
with padding and then border right and so all this is
are the three things that we can control that take up size uh when you're trying
to calculate according to the box model margin i don't throw into this
calculation margin's a bully it's used to push around the box model but not
necessarily something that you would consider a true part of the box all
right now let's draw this out so right now we have
a section with a height and a width of 100 pixels let's go ahead and give this

02:43
a border i'm going to make my border red i'm going to give it a border order
let's say uh 5 pixels solid red cool so i'm going to give my my section
a border of 5 pixels so here we go [Music] there we go beautiful has five pixels
solid red going around the whole side all right how wide what the heck ah
you mother humpers i think anyone can contribute to the whiteboard when um
when this is known so i will find you that's all i'm going to say

02:44
i will find you and let's go ahead and get a new one i got got i really got get
do we used to use a different white board before this class
and that one is no longer all right let's see you got got
i got to do this without you all being able to see it hmm

02:45
i actually don't know if whiteboard gives me a unique one each time let's see
oh there you go i can request a new one and let me go to go to maine
and then i'll make it full screen all right let's try that cool
i don't know if it's oh no it won't because it'll still show it on your end hmm

02:46
that won't actually do it oh that's what i can do there we go
that's what i'll do all right i got it i
know how to do it i know i'm gonna do it i know i'm gonna do it
all right let me do this real quick and we're back cool all right there we
[Laughter] go you know what i uh we're not gonna drag that person
you don't know what's going on in their lives while they feel like they have to
do it it's okay we don't know what's going on they might just be having a bad
day and they're doing it for the laws if i was
12 year old leon i'd be a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing the same thing so

02:47
can uh can't get mad we got to realize that some folks are just young
and they're going to do things because they can do it and do it for the lulls
more power to you hopefully it made your day i hope that like yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah have some fun with it let's try it again
told you leon we've been doing the same thing
all right let's go ahead and do it again so we had a section that was black
beautiful and it had a height of 100 pixels and then we had a width
of 100 pixels and then we had a nice lovely box because of that

02:48
and then we had a border that was red right so let's do border and we'll do
5 pixels solid red cool and so then we have this lovely red border
going around it and my question to you all is
joel said are you drawing with a mouse no i'm using a pencil it's just that bad
okay don't blame me blame the nuns um if you right if you
were to look at this how wide is this element how wide is this element
oh we're getting a mix here this element is 110

02:49
pixels wide it's 110 pixels wide let me show you why we have five pixels
on the left hand side for the border and then we have
five pixels on the right hand side or the border right we need
to account for five pixels on both sides right so five pixels on both sides
all right i got got exactly and so what we're going to do next is we're
going to add padding into the mix we're going to add padding into the mix
right with padding what padding does is it increases the distance right
it increases the distance between the element and its border
so what patty's going to do is it's going to push the border away from the

02:50
element that's all padding does padding pushes the border away from the element
right and so let's go ahead and try adding some padding on just the right
hand side if you just do padding it adds it on all
sides like you can do it all sizes shortcuts to change it let's just add a
little bit of padding on the right hand side and let's make our padding green
let's go ahead and do padding right and let's make it uh let's do it 20 pixels
20 pixels of padding on the right hand side all right and so what's going to
happen now is we have to erase just for now just so we can see it
we gotta erase our border on the right hand side just for now
and then we got to go ahead and add our padding in here so this is our

02:51
20 pixels of padding and then we got to bring back our border there you go
so now my question to you all is how wide is this element it's beautiful exactly
it's a hundred and thirty pixels wide right we got five pixels on the border
here 100 pixels for the original element 20 pixels
for the padding and another five here for the border on the other side so 5
plus 5 plus 20 plus 100 gives us 130 pixels of width cool now if

02:52
we have 130 pixels width and we go back to that original question if i had an
article that was 300 pixels wide right if i had an
article that i wanted to sit these inside of and that article was 300
pixels wide how many of these elements could i sit inside of there yeah
i could fit two right i could fit two and the last one
would run out of room and it would break the next line
right so that's why the box model is important right we can make sure
things have heights whiffs borders and padding and all of
this stuff matters when we start trying to get stuff to sit next to each other
because if we don't account for it it won't fit and it could break to the next
line cool now the cool thing is you can add
padding on all sides you can have border on all sides

02:53
and then the last thing that people bring up a lot with this is margin
margin i don't really account when it comes to the box model what margin does
is it pushes the box model around so what it'll do is if we added margin on
the top it would push our box down if we added margin on the left it would
push our box to the right right so margin can come around and push
this box model around okay we're gonna get lots of practice with
this we're gonna see this a lot in um we're gonna see this a lot
when we get to more advanced layout stuff and so for now
everything's a box it can have height width doesn't matter if it's a piece of

02:54
text or whatever height width padding and border alrighty
a few more things to get through tonight we drew out our box model
time for some layouts you should stop here this is a lot ah
got a little bit more a little bit more time for some layouts
we want to be able to start and be able to start moving things
around getting stuff to sit next to other things
and to start off with our layouts we are going to use floats [Music]
did he say floats he did say floats what what
why it's out there oh no i want my money back
yes floats folks all right it's gonna be all right trust me it's gonna be all
right flexbox and grid are far superior when i

02:55
am writing code in production i do not use floats anymore i use flexbox i use
grid uh i i'm i'm hip i know what houdini is i'm hip right i get you
but here's what's gonna happen a lot of you are gonna join a company
and some of the very first projects you're going to work on because your
company's old will be to use floats and floats are way harder to learn
than flexbox and css grid is right and so i want you to learn floats here
with me in the comfort of 100 devs i want you to learn floats
i want you to get practice with them you're going to hear for some of our
alumni a lot of them the first projects they worked on use floats a lot of the
things they work on right out the jump are converting stuff from floats to flex
and all that other fun stuff the other thing too is that floats

02:56
really don't need any special vocabulary it's just percentages
and so if you can do percentages you know how to layout stuff with floats
for a lot of folks floats can actually be way easier to pick up than a flexbox
there's quirks there's a lot of weird funky stuff with it but
in the 10 years i've been doing this students are quicker to learn layout
with floats than they are with flex i know that's blasphemy i know folks are
freaking out about it but it's just true it's just it's if you know how to break
down stuff into percentages you learn a few quirks you're good you don't have to
learn any extra um vocabulary right and so the the
eventuality of this program is that we will move into flex we'll be using grid
all of our projects down the line won't be using floats they will all be flexed
they will all be grid um but for tonight
and for the next couple of classes we're going to use floats all right

02:57
there's kind of like one really big thing about floats
and what they want to do is whenever you float an element
it's gonna fight as hard as it can to get into a corner
right we're gonna go a little over tonight folks we're a little over
tonight it's gonna fight as hard as it can to get into a corner
right so if i was to float this aside to the left
it's going to go up as much as it can go and then to the left as much as it can
go trying to fight to get into that corner if i was to float
if i was to float this uh main or this section to the right what it's going to
do is it's going to go up as much as it can go and then to the right as much as
it can go it's going to fight as hard as it can right to get in that right hand
corner right so that's the idea here the idea that

02:58
all float does is fight for its life to get up into the corner
and when you're using floats with layout when you use when you try to lay out a
page using floats what you're doing is you're using a side effect
what you're doing when you use floats is that if everything's trying to get into
the corner well then stuff will sit next to each other right so
if i was to let's say float both of these elements to the left right if i
was to float both of these elements to the left
they would both go all the way up and then try and go to the left as much as
they could go all the way up and to the left as much as they could
and the side effect would be that they would be sitting next to each other
so that's the core of how layout can be achieved with floats they're all
fighting to get into the corner and the side effect is they wind up sitting next
to each other they won't overlap unless you do something funky all right

02:59
15 minutes of pain here is a layout this layout has five elements on it if
we're looking at this we got to take some rough guesses what element might
this be what could it be header how about this down here what could that be
footer exactly and then we got three identical elements here what what could
those three elements be sections right that could be sections right so we got
a header we got a footer and we got three sections beautiful
right header footer three sections now this header and footer probably both
like 100 pixels tall right and then these sections are probably i

03:00
don't know let's just say like 300 pixels tall right how can i get
these three sections to sit next to each other
i could float them all to the left right but i would also need to give them a
percentage because if they were if they didn't have a width on them right
if they didn't have a width they would all still stack if they were still 100
whiff they wouldn't sit next to each other so floating is one part we also
have to change their width exactly to 33.333
repeating of course leroy jenkins right we can have four decimal places in css
so if the four decimal places in css if we made all of these 33 pixels
33.333.6 pixels 33.3333 with and we floated them all to the left

03:01
they would all sit next to each other okay so
we're not going to do 15 minutes because we're over time we're gonna do seven
minutes of pain seven minutes of pain i want you to create a new folder
that has an html file and a css file in it and see if you can get this layout to
work it's hard it's a challenge don't worry if you can't get it you got
seven minutes we're gonna come back and go over it together seven minutes of
pain uh and then we're gonna go over it together talk through some quirks and
features that we can see here right and then i'm gonna talk about the
homework and what to expect for thursday
and then we're out of here uh we'll do a raid so go ahead six minutes 30 seconds

03:02
build this layout go do it try it try it even if you have no idea
where to start try you have no idea how to start don't worry try
and we'll go back over in six minutes and 22 seconds yeah
doug tomorrow yeah i was thinking as i said it yeah quirks and features
we are building this layout html and css that's it no flex no grid just floats
where can i sign up for your calligraphy course no flex stone it's beautiful

03:03
what's your timer this is smart countdown timer the mac app
drop of sorrow lowered yeah some of you all just made it to the trough of sorrow
welcome welcome to the trough of sorrow good to be here
welcome get comfortable i'm gonna be here for another 28 weeks
but you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that this is class five
and all this stuff you can already do come on class five and you're already like
you're like well i don't know about the specificity on that leon and well i
don't know about floating like come on like where were you five classes ago
think about that even if you even if you're just like barely
hanging on to threads you're so far ahead of other folks that
you have like this they just have no idea right

03:04
you all have skills that no one can ever take from you more minute
we'll go over this then we'll do a lovely raid no idea where to start officially
observer that's all right we're going to go over the whole thing together
this is where having done the reading starts to come in the come into play folks

03:05
you didn't do the shay hal this is too much if you didn't do the learn layout
this is a lot of it's a lot we only raid gamers no we only rate
people in our category yeah we only pick people in our category
um yeah we've never made anybody that's not in
science and tech or software development or someone that like
some people are in just chatting but they only do software development
being confused is part of the learning exactly
got some folks coming in done all right this one's hard there's some quirks
we're going to talk through it if you didn't get it don't worry we're going to

03:06
go over it all together um two minutes my borders are thick uh it's probably
because the borders are stacking up next to each other don't worry about the
borders don't worry about the borders for now
by reviewing the struggle this part of the shay hal true
thick borders gonna be there we're not gonna worry about the thick borders
tonight problems for future leon and the vibe the song has been funky tonight

03:07
did it nice not feeling very beyonce right now sorry
we can't always feel beyonce right oh we got some more duns coming in this
one hurts it's literally called 15 minutes of pain and i gave you half the time
oh that turned into much of an evil laugh there at the end
in different second remember clear fix yeah it's always weird

03:08
literally called 15 minutes of pain and i gave you half the time [Music]
all right folks about 25 seconds left challenge us leon
what pain teach them nested table layouts from the 90s alrighty
come on back i don't care how far you got it's i'm all back
i'm gonna go over this together all right come on back alrighty

03:09
let's take a look at this together all right i'm just going to go back to
the vs code that i had open i'm going to go back to the vs code i had open and
in here i'm just going to create a new folder
there's like this this lovely icon that you can click for a new folder
and i'm just going to call this not inside of specificity practice though
um there we go i'm going to call this pane right so i just created a new folder
called pain so you can click that like plus folder
icon uh you can do file new folder you can go into your
um finder or fi whatever you create your your files and folders at uh you can go
in there and just call it whatever you create a
folder called or whatever you want so i created a folder called pain
and inside of pane i'm going to do a new file i'm going to call it index
html remember we always got to make sure we we get use the right file extension

03:10
so index.html and i'm also going to create a style dot css
i'm not going to go through the extra trouble of like creating
like a like a folder for my css i'm just just creating the two files uh so
in my index.html i can use the the trick
that we saw in a previous class i can do html
and then html5 and boom there we go we got the the the lovely like starter for
html nothing i really have to do extra here other than
link this html file to my css file right so
i got this bit good good good good oh my god i forgot about that yeah
i can't tell you how many times i uh i can't tell you how many times i have
built out way too much forgot that i had linked it and i'm just like racking my
brain as to why it's not working so you're totally not alone all of us at

03:11
some point have forgotten to link our css so let's go ahead and link
and they're just going to call this style dot css cool
here we go so our index.html and our stylesheet should be linked and let's go
ahead and build out those um those five elements that we saw in the picture
right we have a header a footer and three sections let's go ahead and do that
header and let's go and do a section and we we need three of them so section
and section and then a footer cool there we go
we got our header our three sections and a lovely footer cool um
let's go ahead and save all of this and i'm going to go over to my style sheet

03:12
and i am going to target my header first let's go ahead and target our header
and i'm just going to give it a height of 100 pixels
and i'm going to give it a border just so we can see them they're going to be
thick 3 pixels solid black right let's save it and if we open this
correctly right like if we open if we open it right what we expect to see is
at least a header there we go we got a header
it's blurry give it a refresh or change your quality settings cool boom we got a
header showing up cool all right header showing up and then if we go ahead and
let's let's let's do our footer uh let's do our footer footer
we do a height 100 pixels again and border ah this doesn't feel good why

03:13
doesn't this feel good why why why does this not feel good to me
it's not dry it's wet exactly it's wet i've repeated myself dry stands for do
not repeat yourself and so this is not very dry this is exactly the same code
so we can just go up here and do comma footer when you use the comma what it
means is it says apply these declarations to both the header and the footer
what stands for write everything twice i like it
uh so we can do that and then join get rid of four lines of code now right now
that was just four lines of code but eventually eventually right eventually
uh we are going to have thousands of lines of code
and so if we can save code here and there it does add up in meaningful ways okay

03:14
all right next we've got to think about those sections
you got to think about those sections right
so these sections are going to sit next to each other
right these sections are gonna sit next to each other
and three of them are gonna be sitting next to each other and so we know that
we said all right if they're gonna be sitting next to each other we'll make
them 33 percent width and we will float to sit them next to
each other so let's go and do our sections
we're gonna we're gonna have some issues that come up here so if we go ahead and
do uh let's go and give them a height give them a height of like 300 pixels
and let's give them a width we said 33 and then css can have up to three
decimal places so three to three point three percent repeating of course there
we go we also give them a border border let's just keep them similar
three pixels solid black cool all right so now we have our sections
there are a height of 300 pixels the width of 33 let's see what that looks

03:15
like before we float it there we go we have our header at the
top we have our three sections that are each 33 width right
that's why they're like not taking up the full space over here right because
they're 33 width and then our footer at the bottom okay so
how can we get these to sit next to each other
all right how can we get these to sit next to each other instead of stacking

03:16
yeah we can float them oh let's float them okay all right so we float them
and then let's go and refresh oh boy a bunch of stuff freaked out here a
bunch of stuff freaked out here so we floated them and we can see
we can see that at least two of them are sitting next to each other
all right at least two of them are sitting next to each other
this third one's not all right so at least at least
two of them are sitting next to each other um but this third one's not
and then something else weird happened what happened to the to our footer
what happened to our close enough send it what happened to our footer

03:17
it slid up all right so here's what happens when you float stuff right
here are our sections and here was our footer footer's on the bottom
when you float something you literally float it off the page
right think of it if you literally floating stuff off the page
and as soon as you float it zoop it slides under so what happened is
those sections got floated and the footer was like nothing's about me and and
slid all the way up until it hit the what the floats floated like the sections
floated and then the footer was like it went up until it hit the what until
it hit the header exactly so there's a couple ways that we can we
can handle this uh one we could just like float the footer so that way
they're they're all floating together that would work right
you could just float them all together and then we'd be good
but there's also something else that we could do

03:18
and the other thing that we could do would be to um would be to clear it clear
let me show you what a clear looks like so we can go down here and we can just
add up here and just add clear i'm going to add both
what clear both means is it's kind of like telling
both the header and the footer at the moment but we only really care about the
footer it's kind of like telling the footer to look hey look to the left
and look to the right if there's anything floating come after
it right it just tells it to kind of like ignore like well not everywhere but
like to see the stuff that's floating and chill a little bit right so it looks
up looks to the right looks to the left it actually sees those floating sections
and the footer feels okay to stay where it's at that's what clearing does it's
like it's telling the footer to to look before it crosses the street and

03:19
it looks to the left it sees those floating sections and it's like all
right i'm going to stay where i'm at so when i save this what we'll notice is
that the footer will do the right thing right and now it's down here where it
should be right it's down here where it should be
right down here where it should be and uh we just have one last problem to fix
all right we have one last problem to fix all right right we have three sections
but only two of them are sitting next to each other
you got to think about this for a second
i think about the second we we said that each of these were 33.33 percent

03:20
that's enough that should be that should be 100 that should be less than 100
right but when it comes to the box model when it comes to the box model what
what's causing us to run out of some room here
when it comes to the box model why are we running out of room here ah
because of the border because of the border right so it's it's it's 33.33
plus thirty three point three three percent plus thirty three point three
three percent plus the three pixels here
three pixels here here three pixels here three pixels here here
so all of those three pixel borders take us over that hundred percent
right it takes us over that hundred percent and since we're over the hundred

03:21
percent that last one right that last one breaks to a new line
right it breaks to a new line because we're over that 100 percent
so there's a couple things we could do to fix this we could sit here
and do all the math right you'd be like oh if i do 32.8 or
whatever and like figure it out right or we could tell the browser
right we could tell the browser ignore the border
just ignore it in terms of the box model right just ignore it pretend it doesn't
exist right and so the way we can do that is by going back to our css
and at the top i'm going to do something cool i'm going to do asterisk
as my selector and what the asterisk means is select everything
right select everything and then i'm going to do box sizing border box

03:22
and all this will do in like a very kind of simplified manner is just tell the
browser to ignore the borders when you are calculating the width right so now
if we go back and we refresh who look at us go right so now
we have our lovely header our lovely footer and we have our three sections
that are both 33 and have border all sitting nice and
neat next to each other we have a beautiful layout exactly beautiful beautiful
layout cool alrighty let's take a look at the code real quick just

03:23
to see it and recap we had our header our three sections and our footer right
and then we had our lovely asterisk selector selecting everything right
everything on the page we select everything and we say just ignore
borders when it comes to figuring out uh sizing here and then we have our header
and footer we had to add that clear so that the footer wouldn't slide up
and then we have our sections so this is how you can start to do layouts
right with floats there's there's tweaks there's things you got to figure out
right right there's things you got to figure out
there are some quirks you got to remember the box sizing border box you
got to remember your clearing and when we get to more advanced layouts we got
to remember our clear effects we're not there yet though so what we got to do

03:24
is put this into practice right put this into practice and your homework that is
due not next tuesday but this thursday so between now and thursday i need you
to complete three more layouts three more layouts
and get a jump on that reading don't read the whole advance
just that one part of the advanced by thursday so we can we can get more into
this right so i need you to complete three more layouts and do that one like
chapter of reading and the three layouts are not only in the start of materials
for today but the layouts are also in the slides so here's one layout right
here's another and here's a third no flex no grid just floats i'll do
this upcoming thursday you got this you can do this
you're ready to rock and roll i know this is a lot tonight there's a

03:25
lot to go over there's a lot to cover give yourself a little bit of grace as
we move into this things are going to start getting a little bit more spicy a
little bit more harder but you got this you need help come on discord we will
help you all right let's end with the raid we always end with the raids spread
some love and positivity to someone else uh
make sure if you haven't already give them a follow you give them a follow and
we're going to go over to uh rob rob isn't just chatting right now
they are talking about beer the cure and gnu linux rob is an amazing individual
have some of the coolest kind of like more linuxy type
streams and so let's go ahead and give them a raid
and i will see you all over there get your channel points

03:26
have a wonderful rest of your tuesday be well i'll see you on discord and i'll
see you all back here on thursday everybody thank you for a great class
give your brains a little bit of a break and let's raid you
