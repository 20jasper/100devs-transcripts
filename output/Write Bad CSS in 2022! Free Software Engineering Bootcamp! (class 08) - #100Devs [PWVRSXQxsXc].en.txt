man we're coming from hope you all are doing well welcome everybody what's
going on what's going on hey what's going on welcome back
we got a good night tonight i like this one right we're we're doing something
special tonight we're writing some really bad code i mean bad
like i'm gonna get twitter dms bad you know that's what we're talking about so
i'm glad you're here welcome get in here we got a lot of fun stuff to do
we're going to be doing a lot of review we're going to be talking a little bit
more about networking going to give you some real examples that you can start
using we're going to talk a little bit more about the concerns folks have around

00:05
networking and then we're going to move into
writing some actual layouts like coding some actual layouts we're going to go
back and look at uh techcrunch khan academy bbc we're actually going to do
them this time we now have the power right we have the power to build not
only the html but the css and get the layouts going make it look like the
actual photos are close so excited you're here you do have the power exactly
uh the question for today hey vegan days thank you for the 10
gifted subs i appreciate that thank you for being here
that's wild thank you so much [Laughter] that's really nice of you i appreciate
it yeah you all been popping off hold on let me let me see where we're at right
now the the the primers the primers the the
folks throwing around jeff bezos's bucks have been popping off we're at

00:06
2377 subs right now that's wild i never my wildest dreams
uh so appreciate every single one of y'all i can't wait until we can get that
going right to rc uh it's gonna go right into our emergency fund for our next
cohort i know it's gonna help so many folks that struggle
that need to be able to see psychiatrists doctors but they can't
afford it that's what that's going towards i appreciate you all thank you
indifferent hey thank you get the subs alrighty folks uh we have a question of
the day we have a question of the day and so i would love to see your answer
to the question of the day today's question of the day is would you
rather all of your sentences have to say all of your sentences

00:07
backwards or have to communicate only through charades for a week
seen a lot of charades way more straights than i would have thought
raids all right sure you all went all in on surrey that's wild
i would try i don't know so i i think last time i would have said
sentences backwards because i find that be like a fun exercise
but me and my family we got pretty good at charades
so here's here's the secret to serrate that's something nobody's ever told you
about the secret to charades is you got to play it with the folks you're going
to play with like by yourselves you got to come up with all your secret words
your your book that's a book three words you got you got to come up with those
things ahead of time and then you then you just beast it
because when you go up against other people that don't have like all the
things worked out it's over it's a wrap um it's not cheating it's

00:08
preparation the preparation i'm going to the i'm going straight to the top uh
wherever the charades world championship is that's where i'm going and they all
do it they all do it all right so it's pretty is that legal hey
hey i'm not saying anything here note to self never play charades with leon
alrighty folks you know how we like to do it
i always like to start our evening uh with questions and so let's bring up the
questions slide what questions you got for me just to get folks in here
give folks a chance win clark hey thank you for the donation i appreciate that

00:09
is the cs go server ready it is we were playing on it we got a good test round
in we had like 20 people on the server it was pretty cool
um so the test server worked um i'm probably gonna test it again tonight
i'm gonna probably like a half an hour after class
is done and i send out all this stuff i'm gonna open the server again and if
folks want to come and do another test round with me i appreciate it
um i think we dialed in a lot of stuff there's a couple modes that we're still
trying to figure out uh the person that's helping me build out the server
we got we just got a few last things to tweak
uh and then you're all welcome to come hang out in the office so the the book
it's a cs go server uh that's 24 7 office there's a there's a map on cs go
called the office and that's all it is so if you ever want to come hang out in
the office you're more than welcome to and we're going to get that going so i
think tonight will be the last test run and then we'll kind of leave it open 24
7. uh cs goes a completely free game you
can download it it runs on like anything a toaster i had it running on a

00:10
chromebook before like yeah it'll work other questions
what's the logic behind us watching independence day
it's a trust exercise it's how i weed out the folks that trust me at this
point or not you almost gave me a month this this week will be a month right and
so now i'm asking you to do something and it sounds weird it sounds wild
and so this is this is my trust fall either do it you don't trust me and like
either you do it and you trust me or you don't and you leave right so like if
you're not gonna watch independence day just leave the cohort it's all good
you can find it completely free to watch online remember streaming is completely
legal downloading is not right and so it's it's it's a trust thing that's all
it is now it really does i really does think it really does help
bring home a very important point when we get to javascript right when we get
to javascript that really does help hammer home a really important point and

00:11
so i need you to have watched the movie um before we get to javascript
where's the merch uh we don't have merch yet for this cohort uh we're working on
getting like better higher quality stuff and then we'll do merch a lot of people
keep asking for it so we'll do it and last cohort we just did everything was
at cost like there was no way for um like like whatever the cheapest price
i could set it is what it got set as there's no like margin or anything like
that on there so as cheap as we can find
it at a good quality is what you all get
we're going to talk more about groups in a few seconds
can we get 100 decal uh yeah we we do have we did have stickers last drop and

00:12
so we'll do it i am sipping some tea as always tazzo get me the deal all right
i think we got everyone in here i trust your curls oh that's one that's
one important thing before before we move on i know
really leon get to class i i have an important announcement to make
i will no longer be using ogx products i'm i'm ending my relationship with ogx
and i'm looking for uh looking for new opportunities and so
any any good hair care products out there you let me know they got to be
vegan they got to be all the the the sulfate free all the good stuff that to
be good for curly hair so if you know something that's out there
you let me know okay and uh i'll take any deals that come my way but
i'm officially off team ogx uh i got like a and this is this is
totally probably has nothing to do with ogx and so i'm not even i'm not gonna

00:13
throw that out there i got like a little bit of like a really bad like scalp
irritation on the side of my head and it's like really painful
like really painful and uh i was like crap well what's the
only thing that could be and i started like looking up my shampoo and
conditioner and there's some like bad stuff going down like people are like
currently suing them right now so i'm like all right i'm done y'all cut it's
over i'm i'm a free agent looking for new hair care products so let me know
alrighty folks let's get into tonight tonight we're going deeper in how to
network we're reviewing as always right as always our basics of css of cs layout
we're going to recover our responsive basics we're going to build some
responsive sites but really the thing we're focused on is layouts we're going

00:14
to take a look at some of the layouts that we've seen but actually start to
build them right actually start to build them right and so
that's the goal for this evening is to get our hands on the keyboard to
write bad code and be okay with it all right
uh for those that haven't checked in yet you can go ahead and check in as always
the check in link is in the follow along materials then it's in the learn with
leon live and then they also have the exclamation check in as well but if
you're already following me on twitter you can just see the tweet come up and
go ahead and give that a like and a retweet help swipes find us
and hopefully not spend so much money to learn how to code alrighty
study communities uh before we jump into study communities
i just want to say a huge huge thank you
uh to blah our fearless moderator uh for doing all the heavy lifting on this um

00:15
they they really made my life a dream uh to kind of get this going
these study communities are going to be a lot of work a lot of work and they
they took the brunt of that labor to help these things get off the ground and
get started and so huge thank you to blah i really appreciate all your help
kind of getting this stuff rolling so study communities let's talk about
what they are right the study communities are exactly that a group to study with
uh they are not the only place you're going to interact with people they are
not uh the only channels that will have some of these affinities or identities
made right we have those kind of like already
channels in our main section um for women in tech uh uh individuals of color
and tech right like we have those channels we're gonna be adding to them
right so there will be other channels that will be added there that'll kind of
be free talk chat groups right like you can just go out hang out there and chat

00:16
these study communities are like who do you want to study with
right and so i know a lot of people are going to see
and feel a certain type of way that you can only choose two
you can choose one group and one location group right and so you're not i
hope that you don't take it as like this is the only thing that i can identify
with i am a gamer and now i'm only a gamer no that's not the intention here
it's who do you want to have a smaller group just to work with just to study
with even though we're going to have all these other channels where you can chat
and interact with those individuals right so you get one group one location
all right and so please go ahead and fill out that form
if you would like to be put into a smaller group each of these groups will
have their own chat channel but they will also have their own voice channels
right and so a lot of these um groups may have specialized voice
channels too like the adhd group will have just like a quiet

00:17
cam only channel and so it's just things to get like if you're thinking through
like who do i want to go through the next 20 30 weeks with who do i think i
would study best with that's the group you pick it's not the end-all be-all
they're gonna have plenty of other channels and the other thing is that this is
a big experiment we've never done this before we might
get two weeks into it and it might be the worst thing that's ever happened we
cut it all off and we go back to where we were right
but we wanna we wanna try it right no one's ever done
study communities at this scale so we have no idea if it's going to work or
not work but we're experimenting and i think if we can figure it out
this will make it so that we have the ability to support people far and
into the future so uh know that this is an experiment we're gonna have to
probably add stuff we might give the ability to join more than one in the
future right but this is our first step and we gotta take a smaller step in the
beginning so we don't fall completely on our face there's a lot of weird stuff

00:18
that's going to happen with these groups when we're first trying to get them
going trying to give everyone the roles like it's a big big undertaking and so
please give myself and the mods some grace as we go through
this process because it might just all break but maybe something wonderful
happens instead right and so we're going to try and i hope that you join a study
community and hopefully find a smaller group to to work with to study with and
just give yourself a little bit quieter of a space to hang out and mingle
all right but i really just want to uh reiterate
that i know when you see the groups and you can only pick one you're going to
feel like well wait i want to be in like four or five of these that's okay we're
going to have those chat channels for all of those groups it's just who do you

00:19
want to study with and please don't like fill out the form
more than once we're just going to look at your first application so
um don't don't like refill it out or try to switch or anything take a little bit
seriously pick where you want to be and we're going to throw it in and so
we're going to have the the survey open today and then this weekend we're going
to start adding folks to the to the channels
uh you definitely want to fill out the form today
uh we're gonna leave it up over the weekend um but definitely want you to
fill it out today if you're here now fill it out please catch up crew fill it
out as you join us and we're gonna try to start actually doing it like tomorrow
and saturday all right here's the form if you need it but it's
also in the following materials channel all right submitting work uh we have

00:20
some work to submit today i want your 15 minutes of pain please uh that is the
responsive version where you tried with the three different media queries put it
in a code pen please and submit the form with your codepen link as always
the homework submissions always up an hour before class starts
so feel free to grab the link from there or from the slides
can we use glitch instead yeah you can use glitch replica codepen
um just pick one we just want to bring bring the sights down as everyone fits
their uh submits their homework so pick one i
think codepen has been the most stable but whatever one you feel is is fine
yeah it doesn't matter which which one it is
can we go over the homework of course during office hours
come to office hours on sunday or feel free to watch the uh vod as you have

00:21
time but we'll definitely go over this homework on during office hours for sure
remember office hours are every sunday at 1 pm eastern time the vod is always
immediately available on twitch afterwards
and the cool thing about office hours if you just want to see
the homework solutions you can just jump to the homework solutions because we
know that you just we're just answering questions at office hours so jump to the
bits that you care about 50 minutes pain is still worth it we're
down the road folks big payoff here during a great day the office with
devops failing our pipeline jammed oh no deb hope you're doing okay
when are we starting github once we get through javascript then we feel a bit
more comfortable with the terminal cool all right folks
are we still going to add more houses we're definitely going to do the houses

00:22
the houses will just be study communities so we're rolling out the
study communities making them making sure they work and then we're adding two
more study communities which will be touring and hopper cool networking
already folks we we started off last class by diving into the wonderful world of
networking and what i need you to take in and the thing i need you to hear
right from the beginning is that most people are not good at networking
most people start off feeling very scared anxious unsure and not really
certain about how they're going to go about networking i just want to make
sure that you understand that that is completely 100 okay

00:23
we all start there some of us might have a little bit of the more extroverted
genes but most folks start not really undershore not really sure how to do it
and the only way to get that feeling to go away and to get to the other side
is to do it we're all gonna have some pretty uncomfortable moments when we first
start networking we're all going to have some pretty awkward moments we're going
to have we're going to shake someone's hand forget our name like it's just
going to happen right it's just going to happen
but i promise you the more you do it and the more you find what works for you
the easier it becomes not all of us are going to wind up going
to conferences or meetup groups some of us might spend more of our time in
discords and slack channels and irc channels right it's about finding what
works for you so that you can unlock the thing that is

00:24
going to be the most helpful when you get a job now there is this weird thing
there's this weird thing we don't get got we go get exactly
there's this weird thing that comes comes up when you start talking about tech
people really like to think that it's the skills
that open the door for you to get a job a lot of people like to say tech
is a meritocracy get in here real quick hold on get in close getting close
that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's not it's about who you know
and who is willing to open the door for you
more so than the skills that you have in your head and in your portfolio
it just doesn't get you through that first sniff test the networking

00:25
is all about getting you to the point where you can get past that person
that's gatekeeping you getting the interview and talking to the nerds where
your skills can shine and be the thing that helps you get the job
but i need you to understand that you need folks in your network that
are going to help refer you to jobs they're going to help you skip that
first round of the interviews they're going to help your resume get to the top
of the pile if you do not start putting in the work to network you're
going to run into a brick wall of an uphill battle to get a job
now is it doable could you skip all the networking and still get a job
absolutely but we're talking about increasing the odds ever in your favor okay
something that i've seen time and time again over my past five years

00:26
thank you occ listen to leon the thing i've seen at least in the past five years
is my students that put in the work to network here's how it really shakes down
right here's how it really shakes down they will get referred
or networked in to 60 applications what does that mean that somebody has
literally like gotten their resume into into the
right person they've talked to a real living breathing human being and made
sure their application was seen 60 of those
right 60 of those 60 is the number that i push all my students toward
out of those 60 right out of those 60 30 are going to ghost
you just straight up rip gone just like not gonna like you you got referred
you got networked in somebody you talk to a real human being and something's

00:27
going to happen in the process where like half of them just disappear on you
so you want from 60 networked referred applications down to 30.
out of those 30 you might get a first round something might happen and it'll
turn into like 15 like real interviews where you're talking to the nerds you're
talking to a real real coder right that that's going to evaluate your skill set
right and out of those 15 you're going to get 1.7 offers
that's what the numbers i i've calculated with my my my the nonprofit i
work at during the day our students get about 1.7 offers out of the 60
well-networked applications right so when you have someone that's just
clicking apply on a hundred applications that's going to go nowhere
if 60 referred well-networked applications result in less than two offers

00:28
right and so that's that's the the thing i need to stress
and i don't want you to feel like that it's an unsurmountable goal
i have seen folks from all walks of life get good at networking but they
committed to a process that works well for them
and then they put in work to get better at it right
and so we've talked about a lot of different things you can do
we talked about meetups we talked about conferences we talked about apps we
talked about online communities right it's about starting that process
for the first five years of my career like my first
five years of like a serious like i was in boston hustling right
the first five years of my career i had two coffee chats every week
there was literally not a single week in five years that i did not have two

00:29
coffee chats five years every single client i have ever gotten
every single about dollar i've raised has come from those
coffee chats or networking right now like leon what about christmas
yeah there were some weeks where i didn't but by and far two a week not pushed
i knew every single person i needed to know and it helped me so much
every single job i've gotten every single i've raised millions of
dollars for my startups every dollar i've raised has come because i put in
the work to network and that has always always beared fruit
the job i have right now right the day job i have right or i'm
managing director of engineering resilient coders that came because i

00:30
decided to volunteer right and i met people and they liked me
and then that's how it got me the job right so like there are things you can
do that are networking that aren't just the things we talked about right i
talked about volunteering being my one of my favorite ways to meet people right
to network volunteering for conferences even volunteering for local non-profits
like like there are so many facets of things you can do to build this network
you have to find what works for you and go all in on it right but it's a process
i said it last class every single coding bootcamp that's trying to get
people to jobs to get jobs should be 20 weeks of networking and at the very very
end right when you're about to graduate they tell you to go do the odin project
right this is what will unlock the doors is
what will get you the job and you can do it you can do it
we're gonna get practice together if you're like leon i have no idea

00:31
how to do this guess what we're gonna have a night where we all practice
together right i'm going to show you the actual messages i send the people right
and so this doesn't have to be a thing that you're good at today
this is not something you have to be good at next week this is not something
you have to be good at this month it's something that you have to keep in your
brain and build up and get better at over time
but if you're doing this boot camp if you're doing this boot camp you're
committing to networking there's just so many other things you could be doing
that if you want to be in this this this cohort you want to be in this boot camp
it's a networking bootcamp surprise you got got that's what we do
all right it's how we get jobs you can ask
pretty much every single person that's got a job there's so many of them in
this chat right now that have been highlighting their messages right
right they've been writing their their messages saying like listed this is what

00:32
got me the job this is how i got my interviews right it's
it's it's just not something that i like don't don't take my word for it listen
to the alumni go into the celebrations channel like read what they said half
our students got jobs without technical interviews let me say it again
half our students got jobs with no technical interviews i just literally
literally had a student this morning telling me they got a job and there that
they said here's the offer letter i'm they negotiated i'm accepting it and
then their last message to me the last matches they said to me was no
technical interview it was an 85 000 job right they had never coded before and
the last thing they said to me right the last thing they sent to me no coding
interview that's what we're talking about if you put in the work for this

00:33
networking stuff you get you get so much out of it
i missed your message there sam i networked my way into every contract
and job opportunity i've ever had never clicked apply exactly exactly sam
and if you all if y'all don't know sam exclamation point sam and chat
they're the best at this stuff like i think i'm okay at networking sam's the
best definitely give sam a follow they got a lot of uh really cool posts and
articles on like how to build your network especially on twitter and and
online definitely give them a follow slapper hey thank you for the for the
five gifted subs i appreciate you all right i've said my piece
it's up to you whether you believe me and want to go down that adventure or not
but i'll say it one last time your skills don't open doors they close them

00:34
your skills do not open doors they close them your networking is what will open
the doors and then your skills your portfolio your projects the things that
are in your brain are what will help you
close that door and get the job but they don't open doors all right so
for those that are still stressing over it the core thing we're trying to do
here right the core thing we're trying to do here is turn strangers into friends
that's it that's all networking is this is my ted talk we're done
right you're trying to turn strangers into friends right
and turn strangers into friends and you have to find a process that
works for you to be able to do that uh i love local meetups i we talked
about this last class because the reason i like local meetings is you just show

00:35
up and the act is showing up regularly you get to see the same people i love
volunteering the act of showing up i get
to see the same people i love working on open source projects because i get to
see the same people these are things that you can do
that immediately take you from stranger to acquaintance just because you're
doing it regularly right and so there's a lot of those
types of things you could be doing that will get you from stranger to
acquaintance pretty quick and then you can lean over into friend territory as
well all right we talked about the follow-up pattern uh and we we all made
we all made a a very a very important promise right we meet someone
the next day we send them an email thanking them for their time
right in our emails there needs to be three things

00:36
right in our emails we need three things you need to tell me how we met
you need to provide some value right provide some value right tell me how we met
provide some value and typically thank me for my time
if somebody sends me an email with those three things you're top of the your top
of the pack right so here's the normal follow-up pattern you meet someone at a
meet-up a conference a an event doesn't matter
the next day you send them an email which we're about to see my template for
an email uh three days later you add them on
linkedin and what do we never do chat what do we never do when we add folks on
linkedin we never ever add anyone on linkedin without a message
some folks are a little confused on that
it's uh you're not sending messages when you add someone there's always like a

00:37
little box to put a message uh so when you actually add someone it gives you a
little place to put a message that's the
message we're talking about and then six days later i add them on twitter
now people are saying leon how do you get their email well i ask
i'll simply say hey i really enjoyed meeting you tonight do you do you have
any contact information do you have a business card or do you have an email
right or some way to reach out to you and normally they'll say yeah here's my
email right people that are going to these events right
they know that they're there to network too
and so it's pretty common for somebody to give me their email or their twitter
handle right um but if i just know their name there we go hunter i o right
hunter i o uh hunter io you can throw somebody's name in the company they work
into and it'll give you their email address so let's see um

00:38
somebody works at i don't know let's say linked bin
all right they work at linkedin you find email addresses
there you go linkedin.com and what this will show you is it'll show you the most
common pattern at linkedin so you can see that it's first letter
last name at linkedin.com boom now you have a pretty good shot
at what their email address is even if they didn't give it to you that's it
boom done it's not creepy it's networking folks now here's the thing
a lot of folks start to to get in their head a little bit here

00:39
they're like leon how does this not come across creepy how does this not
people network i think a lot of folks especially if you don't come from um
a more professional background i want to say like like a more like in the office
type profession right don't realize how much networking goes down right it's a
big thing right it's a big thing right and
interacting with folks right interacting with folks
adding them to your network forming connections forming business
relationships is a big deal right it's a big deal and everyone does
it everyone does it and so if you're going to meetups right
if you're going to meet ups right if you're going to meetups people
are kind of expecting that you might ask them to follow up right
they're kind of expecting it pretty much every meetup i've ever gone to people
were really open to to the idea of like hey i really appreciated you you mind if

00:40
i follow up with some questions you have an email i've i've almost never ever
been turned down for that most time people say oh actually it's easier to
add me on twitter or something like that and you move on right now
the cool thing is specifically in tech everyone has to learn right
everyone has to learn like i could take the best engineer in the world
right and put them on a new technology they're starting from the same place as
you are they're reading the documentation they're asking a metric
crap ton of questions so in tech people have to help each other if i
wrote a language i have to convey how it works to you like that idea of like
connecting and sharing information is like how tech started like back in the day
back in the day you bought your apple ii
you spent three thousand dollars on your computer you took it home
and it was a blinking cursor and that's it a blinking rebel right and that was

00:41
it there were no games right right there were no games there were no
calculators nothing on that computer so what you would do is you would code a
calculator app and then you would go to a meetup and say hey
yeah look at my floppies folks all of these have calculators does anybody have
a word processor i have a calculator i would love a word processor and you
would literally swap your programs with each other right that's how tech started
it's always been on sharing it's always been built on like interacting with each
other building each other up right from the very beginning so
most people that are in tech have had an experience where somebody more senior
gave them the time of day went out of their way to have coffee with them have
taken them underneath their wing in some way shape or form
and so you have to realize that's the type of
environment or type of community you're entering into right

00:42
so reaching out building connections building engineering contacts is
something that we all do and it's like the cornerstone of our profession
so that's why networking is so important right and then people want to work with
other engineers that they know it's just natural right it's just natural to want
to work with people that you know so that's why this this networking is so
important all right here's an example of the email i would like to receive right
if someone met me hey thank you for the posture check
and we had some hydrates coming yesterday that i don't think i saw so janks

00:43
and d's cloud thank you for um the hydration
all right here's here's the email that i would like to receive
so we met at a meet up or something like that here's email hi leon it was a
pleasure meeting you last night the event was so well done it was exciting
to meet such an amazing group of people i hope you're enjoying a well-deserved
break after pulling it all together so i ran an event they met me at that event
they said it was great to meet me and they kind of
made it sound like they had a good time at the event right
so that's kind of the first thing let me know where i met you
thank me for my time right that's a really good way to start
and then the last the second part here is the important bit also i don't know
if you saw this yet but someone just bought a 375 thousand dollar first
edition pokemon booster box and it wound up being fake the guardian covered it
and i remembered you being mentioned being a big fan hope you have a great

00:44
rest of the week that right there is doing what what did
they just do in that second paragraph bob is charming as hell
what did they do in that second paragraph folks exactly they provided value
i'm gonna remember this person value doesn't have to be like a big
overwhelming gesture this shows me that they read something they thought about
me and they provided some value right so for me this is an amazing follow-up
email i remember where you met you you boosted my ego a little bit and you
provided value i'm responding to this email right i'm responding to this email
cool so we have that process of going from
meeting to email to linkedin to twitter now can i tell you something
that stays between us stays between us okay don't tell anybody

00:45
remember i told you i was meeting two people a week for years it was true
i used the sheet which you all have but i did something else
i had a google doc on every single person i met every single one
every single person there's a google doc with every single thing i can remember
from our conversation uh with everything that i learned about you
i put that into the google doc i set up my google alerts for that person
and you bet your dollar when i ran into them or if i saw them at the meet up
okay kids kid just played in the lacrosse finals
hey bob how you doing nice to see you again hope all things well how did uh i
know you said uh john's lacrosse finals was like a big deal how did that shake

00:46
out did they win ping pong i did it over and over again
is one of the best things i've ever done in my life so for me
i take this process very seriously i've relaxed on it now these days but when i
was in my hustle mode i was in grind mode i was trying to to build up my my
rolodex i i stuck to this follow-up process
i made sure i i kept notes on who i met i've thought of ways to provide value
and i always tried to provide more value than came in

00:47
right and that's something that really helped me throughout the early stages of
my career all right eventually you've built up a rapport
with these individuals right you've met them you
have kind of followed up maybe email maybe you had a little bit of back and
forth and you want to ask for a coffee chat or you met somebody really qui
really like really cool the night before and you just want to jump straight to a
coffee chat uh here is um here is i want to talk about that's a really
good thing for someone with adhd you're super organized i'm a mess
because i have to if you if you ask my wife what my biggest complaint in life is
is when somebody moves something it's my biggest complaint in life
but when it when when the when i expect it to be in a spot

00:48
and it's not in that spot my life is over i don't know what to do i i can't
i won't i won't remember to do it i won't remember to to fix it i like it if
it's not in that spot it's all over all right
i'm the same thing when it comes to my digital life
i have to have what i call my second brain which is a place where it's just
stream of consciousness right stream of consciousness
everything that's in like that that's like floating in my brain has to go into
this document right and then i take time to take that stream of consciousness
stuff and put it into like more respectable buckets
and i do this every single week i schedule the time for it when i say
i live my life one google calendar invite at a time i mean it if it's not
on the google calendar invite it's not happening
no if fans or buts these kids got guts it's just not going to happen

00:49
so all of these systems these processes are things that i do every single time
because the one time i don't i forget it and it just goes all out the
window so for me my attention issues have led to like very severe [Music]
systems and if i don't have those systems it's all over
cool so somebody asked i want to bring it up um
i think once the adhd channel opens up i'm definitely going to put some of my
tips in there i've been working on a larger set of resources
for specifically adhd and attention issues and then folks with dyslexia i'm
really hoping to get those out in like another week or so um
but yeah so that's why i i i i am i am not an organized person by

00:50
default i am a hot mess and if i don't build systems it doesn't happen
so i said what happens when you can't locate someone in your own country uh
you expand your radius and maybe you focus on remote
do i schedule fun hell yes i schedule fun it literally like has i literally have
like like i have a game night normally most thursdays it literally says game
night on my calendar um it literally i literally put like sleep
right so everything's on there i have to i just have to else it's just it's just
not going to happen you know cool alrighty so we thought sorry a little bit of a
side there we want to get a coffee chat right we
want to sit down and spend um some time getting to know someone remember like i
said people in tech want to give you their time i
and don't do i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do a coffee chat with you there's
there's thousands of you here right now but when i was in boston

00:51
i never turned down a coffee chat in the history of people asking me i've never
said no now scheduling or stuff may have fallen away or emails when it got lost
but i never said no to a coffee chat and i would say out of
the coffee chats that i asked for above 90 were yes like just straight
away had coffee chats right and so for me it's just such a core piece of being
in tech and getting to know others and interacting with others that like it's
just a normal thing and so how much of the conversation should be
talking versus listening i think most like if you're asking
someone to a coffee chat and you've read how to win friends and influence people
or you listen to it because it's free on youtube listen you can listen to it um
you will have come across this idea of people like to talk about themselves so
i would say most of the coffee chat is me being really interested in them i
want to hear about your background your experience and i'm genuine like i really
do care about your background how you got there your experience what it's like

00:52
to be an engineer at your company right like all those things i'm just generally
want to be interested in and then that makes them feel that they like me
it's just part of the how to win friends
and influence strategy right and so most of it i would say is like they're
talking the most i'm energetic interjecting adding a little bit and
sometimes they'll have a back and forth and they'll ask me about myself but it's
more like letting them talk so i asked for coffee chats i said i set a email out
a week two weeks and then a month and then i stop i don't i don't ever send
more than three right i would say more than three uh i don't
really do cold intro so i said what about cold intros i don't really do cold
interest i really like my coffee chats to be people that i've met through the
other channels that we're talking about i feel like when you do a cold outreach
and you haven't provided any value that's just too much friction to get

00:53
started maybe if you can provide a lot of value in that initial outreach than
it works but i think coffee chats are more folks that you've already
interacted with a lot of people love to do this [Music]
this is this is this is how most this is well not most that's how some people
start off their networking journey they just blast out a bazillion things to a
bazillion different people and then they get no they get nothing out of it
right networking should be thoughtful you should take your time it's it's
about quality not quantity always remember that networking is
always quality over quantity right i rather have 10 people that know me
really well in tech and and dig me in or into my vibe and like are on my side
then like a hundred people that i've blasted on linkedin right and so
in the beginning go slow this this is a slow process in
the beginning please please go slow in the beginning don't like some people

00:54
like jump in the twitter threads and they're like ah i'm adding everyone on
twitter i'm editing on everyone on twitter you you like this guy and they
just add a bazillion people they add a bazillion people on linkedin
they they never flop within these people
they don't ever get to know these people and it's just a waste start slow
go slow build it up and you'll get there all right uh here's a
a message that i would like to receive if somebody was asking for a coffee chat
and don't be cheeky and send me an email i'm not going to respond to you
uh hi leon it was a pleasure meeting you last night the event was so well done
exciting meeting such a group of people i hope you're enjoying a well-deserved
break after pulling it all together so kind of that same line that we saw in
our normal follow-up email just thanking them for their time um kind of boosting
the ego a little bit on like how the event went and then the the ask
as i mentioned last night i'm just starting my engineering career and would

00:55
love to learn from successful people such as yourself please let me know if
there might be a time you are free to grab a virtual coffee over the next week
or two before 9am or after 5pm tends to work
best for me but happy to accommodate works for you thanks
there's a couple things that are at play here uh one
i am kind of boosting a little bit here like successful people like yourself
okay i'm feeling good about myself that's a good email all right i gave them
kind of a range like in the next week or two right so i'm talking about this
being somewhat sooner than rather than later i gave them a suggested time range
like before nine or after five works but i'm saying i'll accommodate what works
for you right so it's it you you kind of butter
exactly butter them up a little bit right we butt them up a little bit we
gave a good range we made our ask right and then right and then you do your

00:56
your your your value right you do your value right um if you saw this
is in the guardian it was fake right so this is this is the coffee
chat ask sandwich you thanked them you made your ask you provided value thank
ask value bank ask value right you don't have to use this exact like
wordage right i don't think you should copy and paste what i have here
right like we don't want a thousand people sending coffee chat requests with
the same text right but it should give you a pretty common place to start
thanking them making your ask and then providing value right and so
if you can get that through in your coffee chat requests i know they're
going to go well for you is it weird to take notes during coffee
chats i think it is i i think some people do it

00:57
um but i'm not there to like take notes or be like like i don't know i'm there
to make a friend right i don't ever pull out my notebook with my friends
right like if we're chilling i'm not like oh
oh really right and i'm like right now that's weird right so don't don't bring
a notebook don't be overly eager remember you're trying to make a friend
like even if they're a more senior engineer you're still trying to make
friends right and so really treat it that way use the sheet
right you have the sheet exclamation point sheet and chat works as well
remember it's a place where you're gonna put the event the date the name the
company position the spark like the thing you remember about them their
email and then you follow up on all of the patterns right
you might have to come back and make a copy later because there's a lot of you
on here but yeah use the sheet you're going to forget people you're
going to forget people and then you're going to you're going to come you're

00:58
going to be 20 weeks later right you'll be 20 weeks later wanting to apply to
that company and you're going to see oh i talked to bob that works at that
company a couple months ago you're going to remember that spark so you can use
that as part of your follow-up email hey bob i really enjoyed our conversation
about rubix cubes a couple months ago i actually bought one i've been trying to
learn it myself i saw that such and such company has an opening would you feel
comfortable referring me right you got to have it
don't record conversations though please don't
how does the google alert work you just go to google alerts you just go to
google.com alerts and you put in any name or company or anything like that
and then it just sends you an email when it finds something all right
yeah the sheet's not going to work because so many people jump on it you

00:59
got to come back after class all right questions before we take our top of the
hour break when we come back we're getting into writing actual code
building real layouts i'm super excited um questions before we take our break
about networking please how do i not give off the impression of
trying to ask someone out when asking for coffee
one first remove any idea of dating or anything out of your brain when you're
doing networking it has no place don't be creepy don't do that right
you keep it professional right you keep it professional you
make sure that it's very clear that you're interested in career and their
career growth right you're interested in learning about how they got started as
an engineer and that's it please don't ever

01:00
ask someone out after you have a coffee chat please don't ask someone out when
you're going to network events these are two completely separate ideas don't be
that person um i really prefer to keep it
professional i'm a little old school i'm never going to give you my phone number
we're going to communicate via email right i'm going to make it very clear right
very clear that this is not this is this is this is this is nothing
in that realm this is a business relationship uh and so i i know i'm i'm
a little odd but i i think that i have seen a lot of folks benefit from keeping
professional communication linkedin messages and emails opposed to phone
numbers and texting and stuff like that how do we get open source projects to

01:01
work on we're going to cover that as we get further along
tips to make a coffee chat feel less like an interview just be generally
interested in the person it's not an interview it's hey how'd you get started
right right how did you get started what made
you interested in tech all right these are like very open-ended questions that
you're really and in my emails i'm always saying like hey i'm really
interested in how you got to where you are right it's very clear that i'm
trying to learn about your experience as an engineer and so i start with most of
my questions uh how does this work in places that are
not the us same thing you find a city that has meetups closer to you or you
find communities that are closer to you or if you know you're in the
in a place that just doesn't have anything then you have to do the harder

01:02
journey which is networking with remote companies
find a list of 80 companies you can find it very easily online 80 companies that
hire remotely figure out the people that work there start figuring out what
events they go to what what what meetups they go to and and meet with them
digitally if you're thinking about being purely
remote and in a place that does not have a locality that has engineers then
you're going to be doing the same process but you're targeting people
remotely and remote events it's a lot it's more difficult for sure
uh most events are remote right now some
are slowly starting to go back in person
but most are still remote they'll mostly
be like over zoom or some other platform like that
how do we start conversations in virtual meetups or coffee chats hello how are
you my name is leon what what uh what are you excited about
today like what are you what brought you here

01:03
do you if it's a javascript meetup oh like are you excited about the talk right
are you interested in the topic here for the pizza right any of those things are
starters but we're gonna specifically have a night to practice our opening right
we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna have a night where we all kind of
are talking live to each other where we practice our kind of like how to start
conversations right i know that's a that's um a pretty big
barrier for a lot of folks and so we're gonna do an icebreaker night exactly
where we practice our our openings how we um uh reach out to people right and so
we're gonna we're gonna practice all those things

01:04
i have some of my students that literally have
like index cards they carry that have like all their basic questions that they
practice they go into the mirror they look at themselves and they say hey i'm
leon nice to meet you right and so we're going to practice these openings we're
going to practice these kind of conversations and so that's why i say
this is the beginning we're going to go slow right we're going to go slow
go to the bathroom don't wait for me to break why are you sitting there when you
have to go to the bathroom just go to the bathroom that's so weird uh
we're going to go slow you're going to take your time
right you're going to take your time we're going to build up to this don't
have something right don't have something like that makes this a blocker to you
we're gonna go slow we're gonna mess up a lot we're gonna find what works and
we're gonna keep pushing is there a dress code for coffee chats
no keep it casual alrighty folks we're at the top of the

01:05
hour let's go ahead and take our five minute break
if you're new around here we like to be healthy we like to make sure
that we get our stretches in we like to move around
we like to make sure if we're able to get up look outside the window let our

01:08
eyes focus on something that is not the screen and we'll be back in five you
we have some extra stuff that came in that i didn't
see on my dashboard so let me see if i can find it real quick
are we talking about networking in the context of coding

01:09
or that weird thing social yeah we're talking about making connections so we
can get jobs alrighty about a minute left folks
where did you learn all your networking hacks in the streets folks
most of the stuff i teach is because i've probably already
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up and i've learned from that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and
then i distill it so that you do not
have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up in the ways that i have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
and then the beautiful thing about having hundreds of students that have
helped get jobs is that i've seen them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
and so i learned the things that have

01:10
stopped them from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up then i teach it to you
jordans or yeezys i've never been into shoes i only wear vegan shoes
i just like growing up we didn't have like money for shoes so i
had my air walks from payless and i thought they were the jam

01:11
and uh yeah that was it all right folks come on back come on back chris lance
lance thank you chris all right folks come on back come on
back let's get into this boom thank you for the update
on your bathroom endeavors glad it went well
are you into zero drop shoes i am yeah and the more comfortable
all right and the last thing we talked about networking was the apps and we
talked about this image i just wanted to throw this image back up just uh
just because alrighty folks let's move on golden rule

01:12
separation concerns is important why yes organization for ourselves
our teammates it helps our code stay organized keeping our content on html
our style and our css and our behavioral interaction in our javascript nice
talked about this idea of progressive enhancement this idea that the core of
our content should be good html and if we do that we're doing enough
on top of that quark of content we just add a little bit of a chocolatey coding
that is our presentation or our style it might be a very very thin
thin candy coating of our javascript so the core should be html
and then everything else is really extra and the reason for that is because we
are still in a time where most folks lack access to high broadband internet

01:13
uh in the us in 2017 the statistic came out that 35 of our rural residents did
not have access to broadband that was 22 million americans when you look outside
the u.s it gets even more real in terms of folks still not having access to
high-speed broadband and guess what your sites do not need to be that heavy
there's this really wonderful uh thing i found on hacker news last time i was
teaching this class called the one megabyte club so it's all sites whose
total size right their total size is less than uh a megabyte and they just
keep a really cool list of it and there are some big ones on here we saw
thelight.cnn.com but there's also like npr now has a very simple one so
text.mpr.org right has all of their content all their main articles right in
just text format the site is way less heavy it loads faster it does all the

01:14
things that you need to do without having to sacrifice folks that do not have
high speed broadband cool the only thing that's coming out
recently is starlink i've been watching a lot of videos on youtube of folks that
finally have starlink so starlink is a elon musk company
where they put satellites and they figured out a way to
make the connection to those satellites since they're in low earth earth orbit
and not like all the way up in the outside of the the like lower earth
orbit they can actually connect to them and have really fast speeds and so
people have like really low ping and over 100 megabytes per second so like
traditional faster than traditional uh broadband that's like wired which is
pretty dope uh and for 99 a month and their goal is like bring that cost down
we're talking about folks that are like in the middle of nowhere in terms of
like access to broadband now being able to get access to it and there's a bunch
of other companies that are competing as

01:15
well and so hopefully we'll see over the
next 10 years or so the proliferation of broadband
in places that wouldn't actually run cable to
nobody in minnesota has it and loves it yeah i've seen a lot of people that are
really really happy with it yeah i've watched quite a few um
quite a few videos and people like setting it up and it seems to work
really well for them so maybe this problem will slowly dwindle and
hopefully the cost gets reduced significantly all right where does css go folks
separate file exactly uh if we are writing for html uh emails
we can put a little bit in inline if we're writing uh code at amazon and we
need critical path css maybe put a little in the head but for most of our
projects and the things we work on separate file um
to make sure we adhere to separation of concerns

01:16
all right our favorite game chat what is this oh no what is this gotcha
it's a value nice about this collector nice nice and how about this beautiful
declaration so whole thing is a rule a rule is broken down into selectors
declaration block decoration blocks are broken down to declarations declarations
broken down into properties and values wonderful

01:17
all right we know that stuff that comes above can be overwritten that stuff that
comes below due to the cascade right due to the cascade but the cascade only
comes into effect if the stuff below has what
specificity exactly they have the same or greater specificity nice
alrighty uh we have a bunch of different relationships we can use to target
specific elements in our css so we have parent child
relationships and this right here is a direct parent child right meaning that
the child comes directly within the parent there's no other steps in between
which is a little bit different than a parent child that is not direct here we
have a child of a paragraph that is directly inside of an article but is still

01:18
inside of a section so no direct child if we were to go ahead
and put the carrot here this just wouldn't work it would not
style hello twitch to be read beautiful and the other one we saw is a direct
sibling right where we're trying to find a paragraph that
immediately comes after another paragraph so in this case
hello youtube would be the thing that comes red because it comes immediately
after another paragraph alrighty [Music] alrighty ids and classes right ids and
classes so here we go ids can be used once right once and only once

01:19
all right ids can be used once and only once once you give us something an id
right once you get something in id that id cannot be reused right it cannot be
reused on any other element and once you give an id all right one second cool
alrighty once you give an id right once you give an id
that id cannot be given to any other element so i could not put zebra on
another paragraph i could not put it on another section it is now no longer
allowed to be used and right this other element this element
paragraph cannot get another id cool classes are a little bit different
right classes are a little bit different right class is a little bit different
each element can have multiple classes right each one might have multiple

01:20
classes so i could give it a class of bob a class of rainbow a class of robot
and uh classes can be reused right so not only can one element have it but
every element could eventually have that class and then our classes can be given
as many as we want per element and so you can wind up with an element that has
an id of zebra then it has a class of bob and a class a
robot and a class of etc because ids are unique classes are not so we target
multiple elements at the same time nice all right chat how many points of
specificity well for the rule i should say how many
point specificity for the rule are y'all referencing the amazing uh music duo

01:21
112 that we're all shouting in chat oh the pointy specificity i see so we have
one two tags we have one class and we have one id so 112 points of specificity
uh how many points of specificity do we have on this one
we've seen these already should be a quick quick quick quick done nice
we got one tag we got three classes and one id 131 points of specificity nice
this one what do we got the rule well some of you got got it's okay some

01:22
of you got got let's see we have zero tags we have three classes we have one id
and an important for a thousand so 1130 points of specificity nice alrighty chat
what is every single thing in web development
everything every single thing in in that we see here is a what
a box exactly every single thing we see is a box all right it's a box remember
we have we're figuring out the box model we calculate the box by including its
height its padding and its border or its width
is padding and its border and then the margin can push that box around it's the
bully it can push it around right so if we're calculating the width we would use

01:23
the width of the element plus its padding
plus its border and if we were trying to
do the height you take the height of the element its padding and its border
padding increases the distance between what
padding increases the distance in what content and border exactly it'll
increase distance between the content itself and its border wonderful look at
us go all right so we actually saw this all this the exact code in the last
class but i want you to get i want you to do it again i want you to see if you
can re do your active recall here i want to see if you can do it again
we have the box model code if you're new
around here and you want all the starter code that we're using
in you join our discord uh exclamation point discord or leonwell.com discord

01:24
once you agree to the rules we have a follow along materials channel go ahead
and download the materials from that day's class from the following materials
channel and you'll have everything that we need here you unzip it and we go to
work so we have this box model practice uh
that has the same stuff that we did last
class so i'm putting four minutes on the clock and i want you to go as fast you
can through solving this see if you can recall everything make
sure you figure out how to get it done and if you get done
right done in chat for me go for it we don't get got we go get

01:25
don't get got we go get exactly welcome chalupa glad you found us
i have three monitors and an ipad and my laptop screen so live
chase lessons are thorough they are a lot of great details in there
thank you trader joe would you recommend one widescreen or
multiple monitors um i love one wide screen because i can have everything
next to it uh it's just that with streaming i like to have separate monitors hey

01:26
milky doe thank you for the raid hope you're doing well thanks for stopping by
we got to get a raid coming your way soon
thank you for stopping by i hope you're doing well
gotta coordinate get you later one of these days we can swing through with the
the whole crew hope your stream went well
for uh folks that are that are stopping by
we're working on some code here uh we're working on the box model
and so that's what we see the timer for folks are working through the box model
work how was your stream what were you all up to hey i appreciate that monkey
yeah the shadow command's not working we
got to figure that out occ thank you for trying to but

01:27
we'll do we got to figure it out let me see if i can just copy
there we go i can just paste it into the chat
definitely give them a follow please if you haven't already
and we're definitely going to raid going over there soon
all these folks coming in done nice hey different thank you for giving them

01:28

care how far you got you're doing okay let's go over it together and we've
already seen this one so we should be able to get through it quick
let me chill the music here done finally on time i love it congrats
well done everybody so many dones get on y'all
all right let's take a look at this together got a confession to use the purple

01:29
background all right please give the h1 some padding on three sides so we know
we can use the shortcut right where we can have the
four individual sides for padding so we can just go ahead and do padding
and we could just say if we wanted like let's say zero on the top we could do
zero and then 20 pixels um let's do 10 pixels and then
20 pixels there we go so what that would do is it would put zero pixels on the
top uh 20 pixels on the right 20 pixels on the right 10 pixels on the
bottom and 20 pixels on the left so now we have um
we have padding on all three sides right uh except for the top cool margin on
just one side so it's going to put margin on the top then remember we could
do the same thing we could do like margin and then do a value
for just giving one size we can also do margin hyphen let's just put on the top

01:30
and we can do let's do 100 pixels on the top great now we have padding on one
side on on on three sides except for one and
we have margin only on one side love it a light purple background with light
blue lettering what did you all do for for the background lavender
lavender for light purple and then what did y'all do for light blue plum
good one i did sky blue last time let's stick to that that was fun cool
all right let's move on we're going through this one a little bit faster if
you've seen it before if you're new don't worry typically go much slower the
first round you can always catch up with the vod in the past classes on youtube
all right please give the h2 significant padding on the top and bottom cool so
let's go ahead and do our h2 and then we're gonna do padding but we're gonna
use the two values so that it repeats so we'll do
50px and then zero and so what this will do is we'll do 50 on the top

01:31
zero on the right 50 on the bottom and zero on the left cool
a dark green border on the top and bottom we can do border
top we can do like three pixels solid dark green and we can kind of do the same
thing for border bottom where we just do three pixels
solid and then dark green again beautiful and anyone figure out a shortcut for
that and then the last thing is an orange background so let's just do background
orange eagle screen alrighty please give the section a thick blue border

01:32
all right section thick blue border let's do 10 pixels border let's do 10 pixels
solid blue let's give it a height of 300 pixels and
a margin of 400 pixels or more on the top so let's do margin top and let's do
401 pixels cool so we gave it a thick blue border
we gave it a height of 300 pixels and a margin top of 400. nice last one
let's go ahead and have all the spans go ahead and do thin yellow borders so
we'll go ahead and do border and we'll do one pixel solid
yellow just to keep it thin and then equal padding and margin on all
sides we can just use the shortcut where we write it once right once right and

01:33
so we're just going to say padding and we'll say i don't know 10 pixels on
all sides right and then margin will do the same let's
just do margin 10 pixels on all sides and when you just have one it repeats on
all sides top right bottom and left let's see how it looks
mama didn't raise no designer but it satisfied the uh the requirements folks
it's beautiful i'm gonna tear my eye only a layout a mother would love exactly
there we go cool let's move on time for some layouts folks time for some layouts
uh we have seen some layouts in the past we've never done a full one

01:34
with all the things that we've learned and so we're going to do that tonight
we're going to see some real good layouts for our layouts this week we are using
floats yes that is right the floats the demons are back leon
why did you show us the magic last class why did you ruin it all right why did
you ruin it for us right we saw we saw the magic
two lines no percentages no no weird hacks it just worked why do you want me
to go back yeah the no flex zone exactly no flex zone right now we're all about
floats can't tell you the number of one of my
students that join a company and the first thing they get thrown into is
floats boats are way harder to figure out which are way harder to do layout
with so your first layouts the layouts that i'm asking you to do tonight and
the layouts i'm asking you to do for homework this weekend are all floats no

01:35
flexbox no grid roger hey thank you for your subs all right no
floats sorry all floats no flex this is a no flex zone
no flex no i gotta play this song uh we'll get dmc8 um yeah so all floats
floats no breaks exactly remember floats [Music]
remember floats are fighting to get into a corner
if you float something to the left it's trying to go up
my apple pencil keeps dying if you try to float something to the
left it's gonna go up as much as it can and to the right as much as it can
fighting to get in that corner if you float it to the right it's gonna go up
as much as you can into the right ones you can try to fight to get in that
corner and the beautiful thing when you float a lot of elements they wind up
sitting next to each other and so that's the hack of using floats for layout

01:36
all right a warning tonight tonight i need you to dig deep
there's something that you might not know about yourself we all possess
something deep inside of us sometimes it comes out sometimes it doesn't but we
all have something inside of us we all have a baddie inside of us we all
have the capability to be a baddie sometimes we turn it on sometimes we don't
so what i need you all to do is to dig deep and find your inner body
all right because tonight i'm going to write some bad code folks
i'm going to write some some some terrible code we're we're getting rid of
the old saying and we're embracing our inner body
and uh we're gonna write some bad code all right so be a baddie write bad code
now why do i ask my students to write bad code let me tell you the biggest thing

01:37
the biggest barrier like you talk about any barrier the biggest barrier my
students have faced and the 10 years of me doing this right
is the idea of things needing to be perfect
the idea of things needing to be best practice
the idea of things needing to like look coherent no not tonight not this week
maybe not even this month this night this month we're embracing
our inner body and we're writing bad code
perfection is for closers we want to get
wins on the board we want to get layouts on the page we don't want to be
that student that spends three hours on a header don't be don't be that student
be a baddie write bad code right dig deep every single cohort i've ever run the

01:38
biggest mistake folks make right is trying to get things pixel perfect right
out the gate they're spending an hour just trying to get something a little
bit more to the right instead of to the left instead of getting the whole layout
done right no client no manager wants to see your amazing header
you can't go to a client and say hey i got a header but nothing else you can go
to a client oh here's the whole layout we got to clean some stuff up we got to
make the header a little bit better but you can see the whole page is here right
i just need the weekend so be a baddie write bad code all right
and so just as a reminder and just uh so i don't get as many twitter messages as
i know i'm about to get some twitter messages guess what come here
i'm gonna write back code i'm telling all my students to write bad code and if

01:39
you send me a twitter message here's your reply get in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you
that's all i got to say that's it i don't care get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out
all right get out bye and we say bye bye bro get out got him exactly
this is tonight's not about perfection tonight we embrace our inner body we
write bad code i'm gonna bring up just a reminder so that none of y'all forget
writing bad code here we go it's a disclaimer the disclaimer
and we're going to leave tina up there too there we go
just so you know i'm a baddie i write bad code
that's it i'm that's my twitter bio i'm changing it we're gonna do it live
i'm a baddie and i write bad code watch me
all right so let's write some bad code um and uh we're gonna we're gonna embrace

01:40
that this evening all right we're gonna embrace it this evening all right first
layout we're gonna do is techcrunch when i look at techcrunch i see three quick
things and that's what i'm going to go with tonight that's about being quick
it's about being fearless about being a baddie and not caring about the haters
on twitter we just don't care i'm going to leave you on red
you're a hater ain't got time for you want to keep it moving
keep sending me those dms keep giving me the engagement thank you
you ain't getting a response i'm a baddie i write bad code hold on
all right i just needed it i need it in my head i need it in my head all right
here we go i'm looking at this this could be a lot of stuff right this could be
this could be uh let's see this could be uh

01:41
it could be a header it could be a nav i'm just gonna say enough for now screw
it i'm a bad here i write bad code all right all right got a nav
i'm gonna call this a main a main and then i'm gonna throw this and then aside
and maybe the aside will have like a list right maybe the aside will have
like a list but that's where i'm going to start bad coders club
i'm going to start with a nav a main and an aside that's it i'm writing bad
code i don't care so in our starter code for today
uh we have these three spots for layouts so i'm going to start
with the layout one which is just the template it has the viewport in it that
we talked about last class and uh i'm gonna go ahead and use a nav

01:42
and then i'm gonna have my main and then i'm gonna have my aside
a lot of y'all asking leon what about this what about that i don't care i'm
writing bad code i'm trying to get a layout on the board i'm trying to get
some wins i'm trying to get some w's it just doesn't matter it never matters it
just doesn't matter get some wins and then come back and nitpick is it main or
section it's a main for now i'm a baddie writing bad code
look at look in the corner i'm embracing my entertina come on now
all right let's look inside of here all right we got like an image
we got like an anchor tag for the login and we got like we got maybe like a ul
with a bunch of stuff in here so i'm gonna go ahead and do that inside my nav
i'm gonna have an image and it's gonna give it a placeholder for

01:43
now and i'm just gonna say techcrunch logo and then
in the main we had like an anchor tag that was that login right
uh let's put a placeholder for now and it's gonna say log in
and then after that it kind of seemed like a like a list to me
like a list of a bunch of like anchor tags probably
and so we'll put a placeholder in and then what was the first one
search that would actually be a form but we'll just say search for now startups
search startups videos search i'm going to copy this
i'm gonna put startups in here and then i'm gonna put videos in here cool
and it doesn't be perfect we'll come back to it later right cool
main is a thing yes it is a tag yes you can look up on the mdn if you don't know

01:44
what main is one two three four five six
seven eight nine so there's like nine of them i'm just going to copy this three
times i'll copy it and paste it two more times um boom ovar
boom all right so we got we got like nine of them there that's good enough
for me you're not coding along we're we're you're watching we're talking we're
discussing please don't frantically um uh feel like you have to code along with
this now this this is too much just too much pay attention ask good questions
uh and listen to the decisions i'm making here
don't be like frantically trying to get down too much i mean hey
you're a baddie go ahead and do you that's all i gotta say you know don't
let me get in your way all right so we got our nav let's look at our main here
what china's fintech market can teach the world all right i'm gonna go here

01:45
maine that seems like i don't know we'll call that an h1 and so what china's
fintech market can teach the world the world beautiful
and then underneath that there's like a paragraph
and i i'm not going to type out a full paragraph i'm going to use lorem ipsum
right and we use lorem ipsum and so it's going
to keep the first sentence from that lorem ipsum
so if you're in vs code all you got to do is type in lorem and hit tab and
it'll give you like this filler code right so lorem ipsum is just filler code
that devs use when they don't want to type all this stuff out when i'm doing my
my bad code i like to keep some of the text there just so i don't have a lot of
work when i go back right but um that's what i'm using there so i didn't type
all that out really fast i just used lorem and hit tab and it gave me all the

01:46
filler text cool and then there's like a span with somebody's name
i'm gonna say span and somebody's name there you go
beautiful so that's our we had our nav on the left our main with all the stuff
inside of it and then our side and if we look at our side i'm going to
actually say this is like a list right i'm going to say this like a list
i'm going to say it's like a list of of maybe just like h twos or threes
and a span that's what i'm gonna do in my side ul
uh and then each of those blocks gonna be lis and what's the first one
ah who cares i'm just gonna put a sentence of lorem there we go
and copy that lorem there so uh inside each of those lis i'll
probably put like an h2 it'll have that stuff in it and then i

01:47
think there's like a span after and that span had somebody's name cool
and so then i'm going to go ahead and take
there's four of them so it's gonna have four of the allies beautiful
fintech is financial technology cool so we have our nav and all the stuff there
our main which had all the stuff that was in the main area and the aside which
was kind of like that sidebar with uh the four li's inside of it cool
let's pull up our css and uh let's open this in the browser to
see where we're at all right so right now it's not it's not too bad
not too bad right like it the the core is there we're following what chat this

01:48
is not too bad we're following what this isn't too wild
enhancement right for fallen progressive enhancement like our html is the core
thing here people could come they could come to this site they could
see the they could get to the links they
needed to go to they could find the main the main content they could see our
content that's in the assign that get kind of works but we're going to take a
little bit further we want to get that layout done we want to get that layout
done right so if we go back and look this layout is really three columns
right so i'm going to say the nav is what 10 and maybe like 50 for the main and
i don't know 40 for the aside so we can do like 10 50 40. remember
it's a no-flex zone this is uh floats for tonight and this weekend all right

01:49
let's go in here let's get into our layout area and let's go ahead and say nav
nav main and aside and let's float them all to the left
and we're just going to start off the main i'm sorry the nav being i don't
know the 10 right so we'll just we'll just redo the main and the aside but
we'll keep the width of ten percent on the main on the nav i mean and we'll
come down here to main and we'll go ahead and give that a width of 50
and then we'll come down to the aside and we'll give that a width of 40 percent
cool i feel i feel pretty comfortable with this to start

01:50
and let's go ahead and go back to our site and refresh i mean come on now
i'm a baddie and i write bad code that's all i gotta say
check out my twitter profile first try and so this is what i'm talking about
right that took us what a couple minutes to get a decent layout to get the core
stuff here right to get the core stuff here right like
we could have spent an hour agonizing an hour agonizing over just this nav here
right but now at least you have the core layout and do we have to go back and
make lots of changes do lots of things yes but the core is here we got we got
through the block of getting just something on the board right we got a

01:51
win we got a w we can go back and refactor right we can go back and refactor but
for for starting out this is what you want get rid of the fear
right get rid of the fear get rid of all the nagging things that
are in back your heads and you have to write good code no we're baddies we
write bad code right the sooner you embrace that the
sooner you give up on perfection and you just try and write
code of any shape or form your world changes free yourself write bad code
and in the the process of writing bad code you'll find things that work
you'll find things that don't work you'll find things that you want to
change that you that you might want to update and you'll get better at it but
you have to start don't let perfection stop you from
getting a dub on the board this is a dub
this is what i'm talking about this is a layout the core bits are here yes we

01:52
have to play with sizes heights with we have to move stuff around but the core
is here get here first right be tina alright next one
khan academy all right let's look at this when i look at khan academy
chat what do you what do you say this is what do we think that is chat
it's a header yeah it's a header and probably like a nav like you're saying
like a nav inside the header and then that nav is probably like i'm
just gonna say an anchor tag for now yes i know it's a drop down but i'm writing
bad code i'll probably say like an anchor tag there
um then definitely like a form maybe an h2 because that could be a logo but it

01:53
could also just be text i'm not sure if they have like their own font or
something um so i'm just going to say an h2 for now and then
a ulis anchor tags that we kind of just saw in techcrunch right
and then when we look down here this is probably like main
and then mains probably split up into two sections
right and this section probably is like an image and then this actually has like
an h1 a paragraph and then i don't like writing buttons i use anchor tags so
maybe like four anchor tags that are pretending to be buttons
i think that would get us pretty much all the way to our
simple khan academy site here so that's what i'm going to try let's try that
i'm going to go to layout 2 that i have here
and close this one out of course you'll always get my my solutions and things

01:54
why do i hate buttons because they're weird and i'm a baddie i write bad code
i don't like buttons we had some words i don't like them so i
ain't going to use them alrighty let's do our header
inside our header we said that we had a nav
and then inside that nav we said we had an anchor tag right off the off the rip
here and that was courses i'm going to put the octothorpe as a
placeholder all right just means that we don't have the link yet and it's going
to be courses after that we had a form and whoop
and that form will have an input in it and that input will be typed text
yeah i'm fine with that for now um after the form what do we have here we

01:55
have like our h2 h2 and i'm gonna put con
academy there you go i spelled it right this time let's go [Music]
win thank you leon you're on fire tonight keep doing you
all right so we got khan academy uh and then we have like our our list of
links on the end so ul li anchor tag put our placeholder of the octothorpe
and then it was donate and then what were the other two
login sign up so let's just copy this login i know cool alrighty uh andy

01:56
art thank you for the hydration cheers to you all right so that's our header
let's see let's see our header off the off the rip here let's see
not bad it's just not sitting across right like it's it's it's readable
um we just want everything sitting next to each other right
it's when everything's sitting next to each other so let's go
and write some css here and we got our box sizing that looks all
good let's come up here we already got our header and so
i want every single thing inside the header to sit next to each other
so i can just i could just float everything that's inside the header um
if we look all of our stuff is technically inside the nav so let's go do header

01:57
nav and how could i select everything let's do astric
all right let's do an asterisk and people are saying display in line inline
block we haven't talked that we said floats only it's a no flex zone i'm
going i'm just going to do what i know how to do right even if maybe i didn't
know about that stuff yet right who cares i'm writing bad code folks it's
bad code i'm gonna do it how i know it it's gonna look good
all right let's go ahead and refresh not bad right not bad
uh it's just not like there's no like space in between stuff
all right like it's just in a up so let's let's give it some
give everything some whiffs and maybe some margins so they're not sitting next
to each other right um let's give everything a whiff i could do like with
10 percent and then let's do some margin um

01:58
let's do like one percent to bring it off the top uh let's do zero for now and
then five percent in between and this is
just me spitballing right i have no idea if any of this will work not bad
i miss flexbox so much right now exactly that's why we're doing what we do
so we're doing what we do nice this is uh this is uh this is not
completely wild like it seems like our um
our form is not taking up all the space the form is all the space but if we look
the input's only taking up oh because the input's at 10
right we said everything was ten percent and so the form is not taking up um

01:59
everything maybe if we did something funky maybe if we did this real quick
right if we do that right if we do that then it's just the the top level stuff
right it would be just the top level stuff it would be like just the the
anchor tag the form the h2 and the ul would be that percent
right it wouldn't go any deeper to apply
that that percent and stuff like that to the sub elements so now we can see like
the the anchor tags are no longer sitting next to each other right but the
form is like the full size now right okay so let's let's think about um
let's think about those forms those lies maybe maybe we can target those lis
let's do nav i'm gonna i'm gonna do direct so i don't

02:00
worry about anything like further down let's um can we float them to the left
and can we get them like a certain size let's just flip them first let's see if
that does anything did nothing all right if we inspect
not sitting next to each other maybe they don't have enough room though
maybe they don't have enough room like see how that see how it's like taking up
that full width maybe maybe because they don't have a
width they can't sit next to each other right or right now we don't have enough
specificity either right look we're saying header nav
asterisk we don't have enough specificity either so if we did like header nav li
we came back cool now we know we at least have enough

02:01
specificity but let's try giving them a width i'm curious let's do 33 percent
because there's three of them oh no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that i don't know what that
is cool why didn't it work tell me why is it not working
can what would nav right carrot i mean is that doable
look look at the look at the index.html ul li
right so if it's a direct child there there exists no nav
direct child li they're all inside of the ul that direct child just wouldn't

02:02
work right so that's actually working against us
we got to get rid of that direct child there we go okay got him okay
sitting next to each other looking good i don't like the dots though
how can i get rid of the dots list style none let's try that cool
boom dots are gone i see the yankee cards are working for a
lot of y'all exactly well i see it too all right so why did i put list style
none up here and not on the lis where does that list style have to go

02:03
what does it have to go on yeah it has to go on the ul has to go on the ul
all right we got we got the header almost there like um uh
i feel pretty good with this header so far i think most of our stuff is here
let's go ahead and take a look like that's that's there come on now that's there
yeah we gotta add some some height maybe
a little bit thickness but it's it's the
layout like it's almost like come on now
you can't even tell the difference folks look at that night and day same thing
all right let's go ahead and um let's finish up this layout and then we'll
take our break finish up with this layout we'll take our break
uh we have our main with two sections inside of it and so if we have two
sections we want to sit next to each other what should we do we want th we
want the two sections to sit next to each other what will we do

02:04
float left and give them a width right 50 percent it's percent float left
beautiful that'll get them sitting next to each other and i'm just going to give
them some height i know right now like i wouldn't
necessarily always do this but i'm just i'm being a baddie i'm gonna give them
some height i don't know 600 pixels just
just uh just so that the container opens
a little bit i might put some borders on them i'm not sure all right so we got
that uh if we look at our if we let's just let's just save that and open it real
quick let's just see cool oh we didn't even do that did we
even do the main yet let's see oh we didn't do the main yet so let's do the main
and then we're gonna have like a section and another section
and in this first section we just have our image um what is it what is the image

02:05
kids playing on computers all right kids playing in computers
and all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna just screenshot it
don't i don't have the image so i'm just going to screenshot it
screenshotting is different on each each computer that you're on on macs it's
just command shift or joint all right so i got that i got that screenshot
uh i am going to take it from my desktop so i'm going to it's on my desktop
enable it con and i'm going to bring that con image i'm just going to copy it
and i'm going to go to my my class folder from today i know you're
not seeing this um but i promise you that's what i'm doing
i'm gonna go to layout two i'm just gonna drop the photo in there
all right so here's my layout two folder

02:06
uh what i'm going to do and i'll show it to you
you find it i know it's a little tiny to see but i have a con photo that i just
screenshot it i'm just going to drag it into my layout 2 folder right
we're hacking nfts exactly this is how you hack nfts right so we dragged our
con folder in here so that means for our image we can we can now use it you can
actually see the image right here now in my little tree view i'm gonna call it
and it's a png so png because it was a screenshot and it's kids learning would
be the alt cool we got our image and then this other section had some text in it
what the text say for every student every classroom real results so that's an h1

02:07
for every student every classroom real results boom okay
and underneath that was a paragraph and then some buttons
let's go and do our paragraph let's do another
lorem too much i wish they could just like give us like i want lorem half
there you go we got our lorem and then we have the like the anchor
tags underneath of it and so i'm just going to go ahead and put just
i'm not even going to put them in a list
i'm just going to be a real baddie right now and just put anchor tags
and i think i think it was like what was it learn learners okay
and i'm gonna put four of them that's it that's it folks dust it
we have our main 50 height floating left so they should be

02:08
sitting next to each other let's take a look refresh not bad not bad folks
not bad tina would be proud indeed uh let's go ahead and
let's let's let's let's clean this up just a little just tiny bit tiny bit
tiny bit and we'll take our break give it a i don't know width of 50 let's see
there we go and i just want to bring it down just a little bit
i want to bring it down just a tad bit tad bit and so let's go ahead
let's say on the main and let's do a little specific here section h1 and

02:09
the main section image let's go ahead and just give them a margin top
of 200 pixels just to push them down a little bit first try
i whenever i do this i always think of it i even queued it up um one of my
favorite memes spicy meme og meme if you know this meme we could be friends
uh whenever i do this i always reminds me of the anybody ever see leprechauns

02:10
say yeah can we remember that meme i think i pulled it up already here we go
everybody see leprechauns say yeah that's what that provides me of
uh this is a this is a classic og meme everybody see the leprechauns say yeah
yeah that's what i feel like all right folks come on look at us go
look where we were this is this is three weeks in folks
this is this is we're dipping our toes into the fourth week
look at us go building layouts look at us being bad he's writing bad
code let's go ah that's what i'm talking about crunch where you at
all right all right folks when we come back
we're going to take a look at the bbc all right so come on back five minutes
on the clock if you're new around here like to be healthy if you're able please

02:11
get up if you're able let your eyes focus on something else that's not your
screen i'll be getting my tina twerk on off screen
you all want to see that you know what you got to do million channel points
only fans could be yours alright folks take a break
well deserved well deserved and i will see you all here in five minutes we're

02:12

02:16
gonna move into the bbc i took a peep at the css while we're moving on
huh i was gonna be late huh got got all right folks come on back come on back
all right now i'm moving through this at a pretty good clip
but what i hope you're realizing is that this is how i start all my projects
you'll think i'm i'm joking but this is how i start is how i start i make sure

02:17
that i worry about getting most of it there i can always come back and make it
better do not let perfection get in the way of
you getting something started no one will care no one will ever see this it
just doesn't matter specifically when you're starting out you want to just try
and get into a lot of these layouts early on make mistakes and you carry
stuff through each one i switch between my layouts too so like
your homework is going to be in doing these right your homework is going to be
to like do these on your own right and for me sometimes i get hung up and i'm
like i have no idea how i'm going to tackle this nav
so what i'll do is i'll move to something else right and then i'll come back
all right if hey thank you for the posture check you're doing good today
thank you you mean the right mindset right but
i'll jump around too like if if if i'm starting to bang my head against the

02:18
keyboard it's probably time to take a break it's probably time to get up and
diffuse and maybe even might be time to move on to a different project and then
come back at the other one with fresh eyes pomodoro is a lifesaver as you're
working through this don't just use pomodoro for like studying use pomodoro
for your work as well right i say the the rule is 20 minutes
if you're spending more than 20 minutes on something and you haven't gotten
anywhere it's time to move on it's time to diffuse
it's time to take a break it's a time to move on to something else and then come
back right but with these layouts i need you to be a baddie write bad code
it doesn't matter get rid of this idea of pixel perfect get rid of this idea of
perfection that's going to come way later down the line because as you
stumble through these layouts right as you stumble through these layouts
you're going to pick up little things each time wait i i didn't really

02:19
understand how to like get space between stuff right or i didn't really know how
to push stuff down but you you push yourself you use the mdn you asked for help
you asked you asked for help i loved when we we rated splashly i
think it was on tuesday and the thing they said that the biggest
thing that they wish they had done differently right is ask for help now
don't be the person that says look at my code nobody wants to look at your code
be the person that says i have this very specific issue
how do i fix it how do i do it this is the thing here's the screenshot here's
the code how do i do that thing right don't post can anybody look at my code
nobody wants to look at your code but people want to help you right so
there's something that you don't understand that you don't know ask the
question give the screenshot give the code how do i break it down how do i do
it people want to help with that and the biggest thing the biggest thing

02:20
early career engineers get wrong is they don't ask questions they they they give
up in silence that's the worst thing that could ever happen is you give up in
silence you say this is too tough it's too mentally draining i don't want to do
it and you just click out of everything we never hear from you again
go out with a bang go out with a none of this makes sense
can anybody help me i don't get what's going on don't give up
be a baddie write bad code ask for help right
and and the thing too is that i i really need it to sink in is that you take the
best engineer in the world and they've never
right they've never written html and css they're going to do exactly what we're
doing tonight they're going to learn they're going to
make mistakes they're going to break stuff they're going to write bad code
and in that process find stuff that works and carry that to the next one and

02:21
carry that to the next one and then they come back and redo them over again and
then they delete everything the best thing you can do
the best thing you can do i'm not gonna do it because i need to share this with
you after class the best thing you do is
control a boom that's the best thing you could do and then do it again
i was one that was bigly i'm sorry best thing you can do control a boom
delete it do it again right and then and then you you finally
put it in again and then boop gone do it again right get that repetition in
right right get that repetition in and don't put it on your brain that it
has to make sense you could have sat here this entire time and not understand
one blessed thing that i just did across
these two layouts it just doesn't matter we're writing bad code
all right come back watch the vod slow it down speed it up do what you got to do
look through the things that i talked about that i made my decisions on right

02:22
as soon as this class is over the vod comes up pull it down look at what i
look at the decisions i made think about
your decisions right what would you have
done differently how would you have done
it how would you written even worse code than me right cool usa all right
next one we're going to do the bbc folks also go ahead and open up layout 3 here
can we use classes on this one uh yeah you can use classes if you want um i'm
kind of i'm just doing it without them because i think it's fun
uh to try it without them but yeah classes definitely would have helped um
we would have ran in we wanted to run into like that weird specificity thing

02:23
you know let's take a look at this layout here we have the bbc image
and what i'm going to kind of try and break this down into
is kind of like the big pieces that we see here i'm going to try and carry
some of the stuff that we've seen in the other layouts into this one and see if
it see if it'll help us so i'm kind of seeing like three big areas
i've seen three big areas here so i'm seeing a header i'm seeing a section
and i'm seeing another section and so there's like the three big areas
i'm seeing as i'm writing my bad code and i think the header is kind of

02:24
similar to what we've seen already but this section down here
it has like two sections inside of it this one's pretty straightforward like
h1 paragraph span this one's a little bit tricky this section has
four sections inside of it and each one of those sections has
like an h2 and a span and then this one down here is like
three sections inside of it and each one of those sections has like an image
maybe like an h3 a paragraph and a span and so then that will just be copied
three times to b3 yeah and so that's kind of how i'm
visualizing this layout uh when i'm looking inside the header i see an image
i'm just gonna say an anchor tag for now and then
i'm well this is all in a nav too then like a ul with a bunch of li's
and then maybe like a form at the end right so nothing too wild a lot of the

02:25
stuff we've kind of already seen and so let's get into it let's write some bad
code and see what we come up with start with the html
i'd like to start with my html all right so let's go ahead and do our header
and then inside of our header i think it
was pretty clear that we have a nav like all that stuff at the top is
navigational content um it was it was stuff that's gonna be the top of every
single page i'm gonna say nav and then inside of my nav
let's see what we started off with an image and then like an anchor tag so
let's just do an image and i'm just going to put a placeholder
for now and we say this would be a bbc logo
and then an anchor tag and that anchor tag just said sign in i'm british of them
sign in and then after that we have a ul with

02:26
one two three four five six seven eight nine
nine lis again what's up with these navs having nine uh so ul a lie
anchor tag let's just put a placeholder and then news
and we're gonna need eight more of these john's one two three one two three
let's do one more there we go and then the last thing we saw in this
header was like the form there's almost like this like weird drop down but who
cares uh form and we'll put an input in here and i think it'll be good for now

02:27
and let's just start trying to get let's just trying to get the uh
let's just try to get the nav here yeah i think let's just get
this header going if we look at this header
this header is like has some height to it it's all black
i think we can and like the text is all white so maybe we start there with our
css and then we'll come and do like the main and everything else now
i i kind of like to go by like big section by big section so you kind of saw me
say that there's like three areas i saw the header
the that other section and then the other section so kind of work through
them in those three areas i would probably do the header
right and i would do the section there and do the section and and that's how i
would go i'd do one and then the css the other than the css beautiful
all right so header let's give it a height of like 100 pixels

02:28
and let's go ahead and give it a background of black
and i'm going to give it a color of white now the reason i'm giving a color
of white is because i want the the um the like the so there's something called
like inheritance where some elements can inherit their color from the parent and
so in case there's any inheritance i just wanted to grab the white from there
i might have to use white somewhere else but like that's that's why i'm doing it
cool let's kind of do the same trick that we did before if we want all the nav
elements to sit next to each other right right you want all the nat all the
elements in the nav next to each other what could we do i've already seen it
yeah so let's go ahead and do nav everything

02:29
nav everything let's make it float left i said it'll get everything in the nav
floating to the left um let's make sure that it's a width maybe we'll just start
off i like i always pretty much always start off with 10 when i'm being a
baddie you know just to start off let's also just do
color while we're here just in case there's some inheritance um
and then you might have ran into the reading of like
this idea of some things like wanting to sit next to each other or not sit next
to each other um and sometimes it comes down to like this
display property we're going to talk more about display properties but for
now i'm just going to do display block just so that everything is treated as a
block like we have to worry about like inline or anything like that
everything's just a block yeah cool all right so we've got our nav
everything's floated percentage should be colored um let's see where we're at
what about making them this or making them that i don't care i'm writing bad
code there's not there's no there's no right or wrong here it's just whatever

02:30
comes in the brain and goes out the other side there's so many things that
you could worry about that you could do that's better that's more appropriate
that would make your life easier but i'm
a baddie right and bad code i don't care i just want to get a win on the board
i'll come back and make everything in line i'll come back and get make
everything flexbox i just don't care i'm a baddie writing bad code let me do me
it's not bad not bad we got stuff kind of sitting next to
each other kind of running into that same issue that we saw before
where they're kind of like they the they all inside are not getting enough with
and that the sec like the actual element itself is uh not getting with
and so let's um let's make sure things have the

02:31
appropriate width we don't want the ul like right now right now this ul is 10
so there's no way right there's no way that we're going to
get all those li sitting next to each other if they only have 10 percent so i
think that's one of the things we have to fix in our cascade i think we have to
fix that ul to be like bigger maybe like 50 60 percent so i'm going to do nav ul
and i'm going to give it a width of 50 let's save that let's come back and see
what we're at let's go okay look at me now let's do the same thing then for the
form while we're here right that form is just if we highlight if we
click inspect we can see that the form is taking its ten percent but the input
is not the input's like not doing its full width

02:32
um so let's make the input full width nav form input
and let's just make it a width 100. let's see oh look at me now shazam exactly
all right i'm feeling pretty good about this um
i don't think there's anything else i really want to change here except maybe
like making this a little bit smaller so maybe like instead of a hundred
actually let's use the inspector here let's right-click inspect
and then on the header i'm just going to come down to the header
where it says a height of 100 pixels and once you click on that 100 pixels you
can use your arrow keys and so i'm just going to hold down the arrow key until
i think it looks good 55 looks good to me
55 is where i'd probably want it to stay

02:33
so i just used the inspector right click inspect header and then went to the
height and then held down the arrow key until it looked good 55 pixels let's
come back and make this 55 pixels cool i'm feeling pretty happy with that
let's compare it to the image bbc image yeah we don't have the logo in there yet
but the actual kind of like layout of it that's pretty clean all
right i'm happy with that all right so we talked about having that
header that we did and then we talked about having two sections
let's get both of those sections on the board here section cool
and then in this section let's do the bottom section first the bottom section

02:34
i think is a little bit easier because it's just sections
and then inside of each of those sections was let's look at the image an image
an h3 a paragraph and a span image h3 paragraph span the placeholder for now
and we'll just put um joe byron there we go joe byron and
after the image was in h3 i didn't and i was going to use ipsum that's too much
there we go boom and then after that was a paragraph right that's a paragraph

02:35
and let's get a little bit more text than the h3 was
and then after the paragraph was a span and it was u.s election u.s election
2020. cool and then the cool thing is that
this was just like three of these were exactly the same i think there was like
an h2 here too i think that was like htsn news right
so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this section we outside we outside baby we
outside we ain't outside i'm inside i wish i was outside
leon doesn't listen to us plebs not right now i'm a baddie i'm writing bad
code i'm in my zone all right so that looks that looks decent right

02:36
um so if we have these sections what do we want to do we want to make these how
are we gonna how we're gonna get these next to each other what are we gonna do
chat how could i get those next to each other bottom left hold them up
put them up with 33 percent repeating of course all right and this section is
we could give it like an idea or class but we could also do like header um
plus section plus section i'm actually going to make this a main
just to see some other tags actually this is a main
i like this being a main not a section like that's the main area of the site
right like if we look at this image i'm going to call this a main and out of a
section and so what we could do is we could do main plus section
it would give us only this section and we could do the sections inside of it

02:37
yeah that's that's the that's the move that's the move
all right let's go back our css we can do uh main plus section
and then the sections that are immediately inside of that section
and we're going to give them a width of 33.33 percent repeating of course
and then we're going to give them uh the floats of the lefts cool
yeah because if we look at our html main plus section we grab that
containing section and we're targeting all the sections inside of it
see what we got let's see what we got oh looking real good

02:38
looking real good that's all i gotta say looking real real good all right
i think we saved the more difficult for the for the end
right we didn't we didn't do the main yet so let's go back and fill in our
main look at the image real quick the main i'm really seeing as two i see
two sections inside the main one two and then this section has four sections
inside of it so let's try that let's go back to our main
what does the a stand for in your cup uh it's the beginning of my wife's name
yeah uh for for one of our wedding gifts they

02:39
gave us matching mugs with the first letter of each of our our names
so yeah i stole her cup he caught me i got got it was clean what can i say
all right so in our main we had that i'm gonna say like an h2 for
now that was like welcome to the bbc news hour all right then we had our section
and then we had our section roll up like section
if you if you can tell me where roll up like section comes from like that's
that's like next level you being in my head

02:40
i'll take i'll take a quick gander at chat real quick all right just making sure
close wolfen you're close it is grime it is a grime lyric
from harlem spartans hey briefcase there we go i love it
i hope you watched past classes and got it from there if not like we're on the
same level good job briefcase it's kind of one of the most iconic
songs in grime music when the gang pull up are you gonna back your brethren
top bars all right so we got this section we know there's an image in it
and i don't know what the image was what's our placeholder um two people
there we go and then there was a like a i think like uh i think we might

02:41
call that our h1 peace deal each one historic piece deal
then after it was a paragraph that we'll just use some lorem for and then
there's like a span too yeah middle east cool
that i think that handles our first section that's on the left
and then the section on the right was a little bit more tricky because there's
four sections that have uh americans go home
canada so we're just gonna say that's like an h h2 h3

02:42
let's just say h2 for now uh h3 h3 and then this span and then span
and i think it was just like what was that say us canada canada out drake
that's aubrey to me lamborghini whip green green doors or is it
lamborghini doors on my green green whip
i'll walk i'll throw them out there i'll see if you're in my head or not
where's that come from all gas baby exactly channel five
all right so there's four of them so i'm just gonna copy this and paste it two

02:43
more times cool so we have our section one two three four
we got our main one up here so i think where we'll start
is i want these two sections these two big ones to sit next to each other so if
i want those if i want those two sections to sit next to each other i'm
just going to do 50 width and float them
exactly i see some people in chat saying that already so let's go here
we'll say main and we'll be careful because there are subsections so we'll
use the direct child right and we'll go ahead and do with 50 percent and then um
i think we're going to give them a height
because there's stuff inside and like we could figure it out but i'm like i'm
about to write in bad code let's give a width of 500 pixels just keep it keep it

02:44
channel five you know 55th and then put them left
there we go i'm a baddie writing bad code all right
so that should get them sitting next to each other let's see where we're at with
that cool we're almost there we're almost there we're almost there
all right the last big piece is this like four over here
so let's do that let's just finish that up um that's just going to be main
i'm going to do main section and then sections that are inside of it
yeah that should work let's see main i just want this section though

02:45
i'm going to do main section plus section section
right because i just want i just want the ones that are inside of here so i'll
do main section plus section section that should work yeah
and of course we could do classes could use id but where's the fun in that when
you're writing bad code so main section plus section oops not not asterick plus
section so give me the section that's inside the sibling section that's
inside of main so if we if we go and look at that one
more time just gonna know that's kind of confusing we're in maine
we're gonna look for not this section but this section that is the sibling and
then target all the sections that are inside right and
we want them to sit next to each other so they should be 50 width

02:46
and if the heights 500 pixels will make them 250 pixels tall right
so let's do that i'll give them a width 50 percent and then
height i think we said 250 and then we need them sit next to each
other so we got to float them and let's actually make sure we can see them
and do a border one pixels solid black it wouldn't be 25 width because there's
two of them sitting next to each other right
there's two instead next to choice was 50 50. let's go first try

02:47
let's look at it let's look look here's the image header
to the big section sitting next to each other three at the bottom and then ours
come on now now of course there's like spacing we
gotta get right there's text we gotta get right you gotta probably bring
things a little bit stress things out a little bit but in terms of
a few minutes to get a core layout done that's it
i didn't spend time needling little things i just got into it i didn't know
what to do in certain parts right like i i kind of was like let me try this let
me let me let me see if this works let me let me touch this let me move that
right and that's the process i go through i i just i get playful with my code
right i get playful with my code and the sooner you can let the inhibitions go
and have fun with it and knowing that you're gonna probably code yourself into

02:48
a corner you're gonna get lost things aren't gonna work the more you play with
it the more you tap into your inner body and just write bad code
the better this is all gonna go for you and i know that's a lot to ask for some
folks some folks really hold on to perfection you gotta let it go
gotta write some bad code right cool so i will of course share all of these
quick layouts that we did together i will make sure you have all the code
right i'm gonna ask that over this weekend you try these on your own right
you look up the things that you get stuck on you look at my code don't be
afraid to look at my code if you get stuck oh maybe why did leon do that
would i have done something differently would i have not used domain or could i
have used display inline like think about it play with it have fun with it
the sooner you have to have more fun with your code the better this is all
going to be get rid of that saying or something
that's inside your head that tells you it has to be great has to be perfect

02:49
everyone starts here writing bad code write bad code get some wins on the
board refactoring is for closers let's keep pushing we got a few minutes
until class is over we did our layouts a lot of y'all were kind of giving great
suggestions as we were going along so good stuff everybody all right
we talked about responsive websites making sure our
sites look good across all devices i just want to get some repetition in and
then we'll do our raid as always uh and spread some love and positivity
around so let's get some let's get some um some review in real quick with our
last 10 minutes and then i'll talk about the homework and the expectations over
the weekend and then i will do a raid like we always do

02:50
so we used to have fixed websites that were
stuck to one pixel size of width and no matter what you did they didn't respond
to the size of the browser that's in direct contrast to a site
that's responsive where the site will look good
across all different devices right it'll look good on mobile desktop laptop
tablet it doesn't matter i'm going to say bye to tina bye tina there we go
15 breaks gonna throw it back out exactly all right
so we talked about the core things that make a site responsive
right has to be fluid right all the stuff we did today
all the things that we just did today like they're fluid
right i did everything in percentages that's not bad folks that's not bad
it's fluid we got that fluid underpinning right and so since we have

02:51
a fluid underpinning it looks good in between screen sizes right
one thing that we didn't do too well though as we were doing this was uh
making our fonts and things elastic right that's something we would go back
and change first is making stuff elastic sizing using m's and rems and then we
would have to start making content decisions right let's start making
content decisions we have to start using media queries to make those content
decisions but remember fluidity comes from everything being in percentages
elasticity comes from using m's and rems and next week we're going to spend more
times with m's and rims i know it's a tricky topic the idea is it's just a
responsive unit of measure meaning that we can set a base font size and then one
m is representing of that base font size and so the beautiful thing is we could
do our whole site and rems and if we wanted to double the size right if we
went to double the size we could just go ahead and double our html here yeah

02:52
cool but the last really important thing right the last important thing when it
comes to responsiveness is content decisions what should remain
on the screen what shouldn't be there should we get rid of this
list so we get rid of asides what happens when we get to that screen size
and so we need fluid underpinnings elastic underpinnings we need good
content decisions cool how do we make content decisions
like what helps us make those content decisions chat
our media queries exactly our media queries are what help us to make sure
that we are able to [Music] make those content decisions at different sizes
here's an example of a media query right where anything less than 600 pixels

02:53
would be colored blue and uh we we coded media query last
class i'm going to say because we're getting a little little long here
remember we want to have this meta viewport uh at the top of any of our
of any of our templates to make sure that our our media queries will work
across devices not just on desktop the work on mobile tablet remember
we signed a lifelong pact uh to make sure we never set user scalable to know
uh which would stop people from pinching and zooming which is one of the biggest
accessibility devices that we have available your homework was to make this
responsive you should have already turned it in if you don't you can turn
it in after class if you need to but this was the homework to make it
responsive we're going to go over it together on
on sunday so on sunday come back we'll have office hours we'll review some of
the layouts we will review this layout specifically we'll have time for

02:54
questions and if you're kind of stuck on anything that
we did today or that we've done over the past couple days come the office hours
we're going to get more repetition in we're going to get more practice in and
we're going to have some fun with it okay homework
uh there are in our folders for today there's a lot of stuff
a lot of stuff to be had for homework this week and so i just want to make
sure everybody's on the same page and that we go over it together um
in the materials folder for today we had the layouts that we did together
so we have these class layout photos the bbc the khan academy the tech crunch
part of your homework this weekend right
part of your homework this weekend is to go through and do these again right go
through and do the bbc do the khan academy do the tech crunch in the same
vigor that i did it be a baddie write bad code floats only

02:55
right no flex this is a no flex zone until we get out of next week right play
with your percentages the reason why i really also like it too is because it
forces you to really understand the box model
understand how stuff are sitting next to each other and so no flex zone
floats go back and do the bbc do the khan academy do
the tech crunch make sure you feel good with those
and then there's two other layouts that i want you to work through
there's this homework layouts folder that i have for you i want you to work
through those as well so the first one is level ground
level ground is a client that we had at resilient coders way back in the day
resilient coders had an agency and we used to do projects for for other
non-profits and so this is one of the clients we had and what we did and
here's kind of like what a a wireframe would look like that comes from a
designer it's kind of all boxes and it's a pretty clean layout to try

02:56
for one of your first real layouts right um you got kind of just plain text and
boxes and so if you can get through the bbc you can definitely do this layout
and so be a baddie write bad code try and get it as close as possible right
footer goes goes wild yeah don't don't folk don't don't spend four hours on the
footer be a baddie write back code get as close as you can right
