00:01
little a little a little extension shall we say uh so
thank you all for being here hope you had a really great weekend
what what a weekend folks what a weekend we had our microsoft sponsored stream
so many uh good moments during that so many
raffles so many cool stuff that happened
gave away a laptop then we came back for our friday with friends and we had nick
yo shout out nick exclamation point nick in chat
uh thank you so much for sharing that story and then
just seeing that kind of inspire so many folks or help folks realize that there
are so many different ways and paths that move in this journey and it was
just really cool to hear so if you missed that on friday with friends it's
it's going to be fridays on discord we had 700 plus people 700 plus people on a

00:02
friday and the day before the day before we were we're all hanging
out with hello it's rufio the newest member of the stream team 700 plus
people were there too this community is hands down
hands down one of the best communities not only to learn how to code but on the
internet and we proved it this week 700 plus people
in a twitch stream just hanging out doing some cold wars
then we had our microsoft sponsored stream then we had 700 plus people on
discord to hear nick talk then saturday we held it down
on our place we're gonna talk about it we held it down sunday we held it down
monday we were back with rufio number one streamer in the category they
were number one streamer in the category their past two streams number one

00:03
streamer in the category let's go w's all around this week and then we got today
and today's a special class it's a little weird it's a little different
we're going to get into we're going to talk about it but it's a little
different of a class tonight we are going to be doing our resume review
and to do this resume review uh we were supposed to do it on monday but rufio's
stream was way better idea coming through with the code wars from
beginning to getting on github that was amazing if you missed it their vod is
live and what we want to make sure is that i didn't want to do it hey
bunny what's going on thank you for the raid bringing the crew
388 folks that's wild yo if you all haven't followed bash
buddy we've done the raid once if you haven't followed yet make sure you go
ahead and give them a follow let me see if i can uh throw this shot out here in
chat you're missing out on some really good
streams we we just so basically we just learned about the terminal right so we

00:04
learned about the terminal last class so now we got we got a couple thousand
folks that need to come by your stream and and learn and learn how to do it
right we covered the basics now they got to
come through and do it right so let's go ahead and uh let me let me see we can
throw this in the chat real quick i'm going to grab this i'm going to copy
and paste it a few times there we go you haven't given them a follow yet here
when i'm gonna i'm gonna spam it a little bit here
make sure you give them a follow now that you know what the heck we're
doing in the terminal you gotta swing through and watch their streams they're
they're they're slicing and dicing they're using tools
we showed that that that that weird thing that happened we wrote our commit
message the wrong way and we got thrown into that that weird text editor
they're they're balling at it so go go ball out and watch them when you have

00:05
the chance thanks for raiding hope i hope your
stream went well what were you all up to today
yeah make sure make sure you swing through thank you for the raid
all right we're doing our resume review resume view is a little bit different
we're supposed to do it on we're supposed to do it on monday
but i'm gonna delete this as soon as it's over
as soon as this as soon as we're done this stream i'm gonna delete it so
i figured out that if well i figured that we shouldn't do it on monday
because we don't have everyone but once we're done this tonight as soon
as it's done gone done so neat it's gone
uh so the idea here is that we are going to be looking at a good resume example
that i'm going to ask you all to use a good template and then
we're going to look through some some folks that signed up to be roasted and uh
we're gonna go a little we're gonna go a little hard i tried my best to hide

00:06
their names and stuff but we're gonna go in a little bit and so we don't need
that staying up there and the other thing is that all right
we're we're the uh we're the the we're the the victims of our own success
uh we have a lot of people that are here we have so many new folks that join us
each stream and those folks might not know the the
ways of the hundred devs right they might see a a a uh a lovely form on
somebody's portfolio site and try to fill it out a hundred times just to see
if it works they they they they don't they don't
they're not the they're you know they're not part of the the cool kids you know
they they they they're not kind and so we don't want to leave up uh the video
or the uh means for these folks to be found elsewhere on the internet
so i didn't tweet today and as soon as we're done we're going to
delete the vod and we hope that that will simmer some of the folks

00:07
uh from finding us that aren't part of our community so everyone that's here
everyone that came over from bash money stream like we're we're cool
but there's some riffraff that get mixed into it and we don't want that to to be
lingering so we're gonna do it and we're gonna delete it
melody dev hey thank you for the gift it
subs how are your streams been i've been seeing you i've been seeing you hope
they were doing well going well thank you for the gift of subs all right so
the riff raff yeah exactly bash all right so
now we're now we got that out the way let's jump into it uh we got some things
to do some things to talk about before we get to our lovely lovely resumes
all right we're going to talk through some stuff about 100 devs we're going to
review some resumes and then your homework guess what is to do your resume
now we will have a full class on how to get ready for the hunt the

00:08
hunt is what we call our getting the job process
and so there's so much stuff that goes into hunt that's not just a resume
but the cool thing about starting with your resume it's a lot of these really
important concepts a lot of these little like these very
important concepts we can start to simmer on we can let those uh
i thought you were telling me to do something else
i was like leon you're a little off today you need to go to
i just got it thank you uh we're going to we're going to see a lot of this stuff
in our hunt classes but the resume brings up some really important topics
some things about crafting your story thinking about your past experiences
thinking through the things that you want to highlight as you go into the
hunt so i want to do a very kind of intro to resume and looking

00:09
at some resumes and then i need you to do it and i need you to start thinking
through some of these really kind of meaty topics and we're going to see that
in a second but that's the reason why we're doing a separate class on just the
resume we got 10 resumes we're going to go through we'll do a laptop raffle and
we'll call it and you're going to use that extra time tonight that we end
early with to actually do your resume cool that'll carry us into the next
couple weeks where we're gonna be looking at object-oriented programming
uh going deep into that and then once we're done object-oriented programming
before we shift gears to going into the back end
we will have a class or two on starting the hunt the job search process getting
all the things we need to start getting together so that we can be effective
when it comes time to get a job cool yeah no check-in tonight because i don't
want the as we said the riff-raff coming
in from twitter we want it just to be us we want to make sure that we're we're

00:10
being kind to the folks that have volunteered themselves as tribute and so
yeah no check-in and we'll keep it we'll keep it in the
family no new friends exactly except for bash bunny and the crew they're cool
though we've been there we're friends already cool
alrighty i would like to start off with some questions i think we got through
some some big ones already so we'll do like one one more question
and then we'll get into no apis no we our our api class will be on thursday
uh because we were supposed to do this on monday but we switched it up so more
people could see it question of the day was were you able to
participate in our place of course airrosti of course whoa
look at these folks that were able to participate that's wild

00:11
i had no idea with so many but all right that's cool i i have some
screenshots for those that weren't able to join us i got some screenshots for
you we'll get to it alrighty no check-in we don't want the riff-raff
coming through twitter so no check-in but if you haven't already
go ahead and show some love on that microsoft tweet if you haven't checked
in from our last class they came through
they splashed out so please make sure if you haven't already like and retweet
that tweet just because they showed out for our community so let's uh let's show
them some love uh for folks that won some stuff we've been giving out stuff
all weekend uh you'll start hearing back from me uh like today and tomorrow
there's just a lot of like little kind of administrative stuff we gotta do so
if you didn't hear from me this weekend that's okay you're gonna hear mainly
from me probably tomorrow is when i'll get through the bulk of stuff i got to
get your addresses and all that fun stuff so we're still kind of we got a

00:12
lot to get through i'll get to you and uh don't don't panic if you didn't get
something specifically this weekend you'll get it by end of the day tomorrow
cool this is the link you can also do check in if you missed the microsoft link
cool remember folks health first we we decided to
go ahead and extend some deadlines so that we could focus in on some of the
meteor topics that we have coming up we have apis that we're getting deeper into
on thursday then we have object oriented program that we're getting into deeper
and so remember health first we're expecting some deadlines to give
ourselves some breathing room but please this is the point in program where you
have to be taking care of yourself doing your stretches right making sure that
you are doing some sort of pomodoro where you're not just roasting your
eyeballs on the screen for 10 hours a day right make sure you're taking those
breaks make sure you're letting your eyes relax make sure you're letting your
hands relax make sure you're doing all the things so you can go the marathon

00:13
not just the sprint cool remember no networking until may so all
of april i'm not expecting you to network
uh so so you don't you don't have to you don't have to hustle the networking
right now uh save your brain a little bit use that energy to go into the
materials also don't hound streamers for for coffee chats please
it's really weird when we go to a raid and there's like a bazillion people
asking for coffee chats they don't want to have coffee chats with you some of
them have been amazingly nice and have opened up coffee chats but don't keep
hounding them in their in their chat asking for coffee chats it's it's it's
not a good look at all so please you don't have to network this week so
you don't have to do it uh so no networking until may um
also shout out to a lot of the folks in the twitch community that have done

00:14
coffee chats i'm thinking of mel true so many folks have opened up their like
lives to help us and so be cool all right be cool
also show up for your coffee chats if you can't make a coffee chat just let
them know that you can't make it don't ghost people
i'm really convinced and the reason the reason why
uh the reason why i didn't tweet tonight
and the reason why i'm gonna delete this spot after is there a lot of folks that
aren't part of a hundred devs that are now aware of a hundred devs right so
there are folks that use and see the hashtag on twitter that see us at the
top of the category on twitch and so they might not have been here for the
full ride and might not know the the norms right and so
yeah some folks are ghosting i have a really strong suspicion that they're not
really 100 devs they're just people seeing that hashtag on twitter and then
using it so don't be that if you are part of behind your devs

00:15
right if you if you are part of 100 devs hold yourself to that that good old 100
devs caliber make sure you're showing up for coffee chats make sure you're
presenting yourself well so other folks want to help and support this community
so many folks have seen how wonderful and amazing this community is and want
to help and support you all so live up to that so many folks opening up their
calendars giving us their time like be respectful of that just so that more
folks do it right cool especially after we questioned in our place exactly we we
in difference that we were mentioned in three different 20k plus streams exactly
so you don't want us to use 100 devs no that's not what i'm saying at all what
i'm saying is that live up to that to that moniker live up
to being a good contributor to 100 devs if you set if you set a coffee chat with

00:16
someone actually show up to that coffee chat
when we raid folks be kind be respectful
show love right that's what we do around
here and if we got to we're happy to get
you out because we don't need folks that can't be kind that can't be respectful
so please set up a coffee chat do the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coffee chat or at least
let them know that you can't make it and when we read be kind right don't ham
people for things like that's that's kind of weird cool all right
now this is this is like one or two people out of the thousands that are
here but it has to be said and if you can't do that you can't be
kind you can't be respectful you can't be somebody that doesn't hound then get
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out we don't need you here our client deadline [Laughter]
our client deadline was moved to may 3rd so you have all of april to get extra
work done to get that client to do all the things that we covered in

00:17
our getting a client class so know that you have until may 3rd to sign on the
dotted line you don't have to be finished on that work you just need that
signed contract of 200 or more cool we also talked about for a lot of
folks in our community getting a paid client might not be something they can
do due to visa issues or whatever it may be so we mentioned two other
alternatives you can volunteer for a grassroots org but you still do the same
process still a proposal still a contract still getting payment which is
in the form of them being the best reference you have ever had in your
entire life you could also contribute to free software
we posted this first timers only where you can find
good helpful communities that want early career engineers to help and support
their project that would also count for your getting of the client and we're
gonna see today why getting one of these three is so important
all right we're gonna see why getting one of these three is so important today
it's gonna be a big portion of our resume it's gonna be a big thing that

00:18
helps you get past that [Music] sniff test okay
uh we had a newsletter raffle today we had a newsletter raffle today so i've
already grabbed the folks that filled out the newsletter uh raffle
remember it pays to open the newsletter folks today there was a raffle in the
newsletter i already grabbed all the folks that submitted it before i pressed
go live i clicked plus go live i grabbed the names and i put it so we had 1200
people that filled it out before we went live on stream i forget every time
no worries but i already threw them into a random name picker we're gonna go
ahead and do that 1200 people filled it out before i even went live today which
is wild i see y'all let's go and pick it three two one all right maze skip maze

00:19
congratulations uh i will send you a whisper uh because

from brokering deals with our germans to the to the to the west
to uh holding off mexico from the north to uh brokering
peace deals with poland and uh so many other wonderful communities
rome uh who else do we we broke good deals with just so many wonderful
communities that came together uh to to build out some really beautiful stuff we
made a lot of friends a lot of folks that were not part of our community that
were in our discord to like help coordinate chibi girl exactly 100 geck
exactly so trolls gigi troll exactly so many folks that um
we got to meet and hang out with over the weekend
so many so many factorio exactly so many
folks that that heeded the call when the streamers were

00:21
riding rampant and we were able to build some really cool stuff and it was just
really fun to see the community to come together to place pixels [Laughter]
can we place that we've broken international treaties on our resume
hell yeah you can oh yeah we've got our good homies the detroit lions before
they got taken over by h3 and then by dream like oh what what a weekend you
had to be there uh it's one of those kind of internet
experiences that doesn't come around that often and so it was super fun
hanging out with you all being in the voice channels
glad so many folks were able to participate and we built some really
cool stuff so the original og little leon uh that we had to broker uh with a the
technical school from from germany we've rebuilt and had our lovely little mini
leon uh we had the goomba uh that blah requested we had this
lovely goomba that got put on our place if you don't know what our place was
uh it was a it's a it's a it's an april fool's thing

00:22
that reddit did in 2017 they brought back this year basically anyone with a
reddit account can place a tile a one color pixel every five minutes and so
you have all these communities that come together to place pixels in five minute
intervals and so we're able to build this first little leon then we're able
to build the goomba we had a bob at one point and uh we had the bigger uh the
bigger leon that got built until poland wiped out the wego get which was which
was a lot of fun so three bobs exactly we had so many
other little things that popped up too but these are some of the bigger ones
that i was able to grab throughout the weekend and so it was just a lot of fun
to see all y'all organize and build some some some really cool stuff
yeah it's it's a it's an experience i'll remember for a while
yeah poland came in and wiped out the we
go get they were nice though they didn't go any further they could have with
their numbers taking the whole thing over yeah and at one point one of the

00:23
streamers i'm gonna mention their name i've never been so heated over pixels in
my life i was i was i was feeling some type of way
i was like i should be having fun this shouldn't be bothering me but when
you're somewhere just like trashing the art of like small communities i was like
died this is i was about to do some stuff that i shouldn't be doing so
i i took some moments to chill i was able to relax a little bit [Laughter]
but at the end we had some really cool stuff and it was a really fun time so
thank you everybody that was able to stop by i think it was able to
contribute uh it was perfect timing for the best week ever it was really a cool
collaboration that we could do i really want to figure out other fun stuff for
us to do as a community now that i can see so many of you all want to show out

things coming up soon all right next big thing to announce

00:24

in their day-to-day life and they're with us to pick up some
javascript skills but they're already a developer in their own right so i love
that they can bring some experience to the table they're an expert at kind of

they got stuck you could help answer how they got stuck like it's just like a
really cool way to continue your learning and then mine wolf is really
good at taking the stuff that we're already learning in class and making it

00:28
good stuff thursday as we wrap up the best week ever but until then
let's talk about some resumes so tonight we are going to review some resumes
we're going to start off with looking at a template that that you can all use
and a lot of folks will try and do other stuff they won't use the template just
use the template at least for your first
pass so we'll look at a template then we are going to look um
we're going to look at 10 different resumes we'll do the laptop raffle we'll
do a raid and then we'll end because i want you to work on your resume tonight
i want you to take all the things that we learned this evening together
and use some of that energy some of this time to put it into your resume you are
all doing your networking you're all getting to the point where you're
starting to have a little bit more of a web presence you're gonna start pushing
things to get in github you're gonna be in a situation where folks are going to

00:29
want to start asking about your professional experience they're going to
start asking about if you have a resume if they can pass it
along to someone else so it's important to um to figure all that stuff out this
evening cool so here is the template uh for the resume it is in the slides
and uh i can also put the link directly in chat um
here is the link i think we actually have exclamation point resume
that works let me see i think we actually have a chat command for it
if not i'll create one right now all right hold on let's copy link address

00:30
and i'm going to add a command one second boom
oh there already exists the command resume let's see
yeah it's already there so excretion point resume is the link for the resume
and uh it should go ahead and get that your way
let me go ahead and spam it in chat a little bit so folks can get it
boom there we go in case you need the link you can always look at the slides too
and grab it from the slides but that's the link it's that bitly link there
that'll take you to the resume cool uh it might go down
google doesn't like it when we send too many people to it um and so

00:31
it might it might it might not load so don't worry about it right now let it
chill when we get our first break um it'll it'll load i've seen some
people saying woo i got my coffee yeah whatever reason when we send so many
people to it it doesn't like it so just chill for now uh we'll we'll look at it
together here live and then uh you can take your time during the break to grab
it cool limited edition resume template exactly so so many folks say hey leon
do i need to buy a resume builder do i need to buy a resume template no
use this one myself and we'll eventually kind of hear from this
person a bit more when we get to our hunt
we have someone at resilient coders that
i i can only describe as a beast and her name is stephanie and stephanie is the
one that helps all of our alumni like lock down their jobs and so this kind of
template is something that i have learned a lot of this resume

00:32
stuff i've learned from uh working with this beast of a person that just really
helps all of our students to get jobs and so yeah we call stephanie the fairy
job mother at rc and so a lot of what i have learned has come from them and then
seeing hundreds of students hundreds of students get jobs right and
so a lot of this stuff is not like hey i think this might be cool or like hey
this stuff is like i think this is what your resume no
this is what i've seen helped hundreds of people actually lock down a job
across all different types of interviews all types of ranges so um this is
something that i've put some work into but the fairy job mother has done the
heavy lifting and um i'll share their i'll share their stuff maybe after clash
just so you can give them like a follow on twitter definitely somebody you want
to follow because they have some serious skills when it
comes to helping folks get jobs and i'm going to hype them more as we get into
our actual class on how to get a job but i just want to throw that out here so
you don't think it's just all me this is a lot of hard work from some

00:33
other folks but the important thing here is this has worked for a lot of people
and so when it comes time to getting this job stuff
it's not stuff i'm making up it's not stuff that i'm guessing about it's
literally something i've seen across a thousand plus interviews across hundreds
of students that has been distilled into
this template so could you use something else
yes feel free to i don't really care at the end of the day this is what i know
works so this is what i'm going to show you
and it's up to you if you're going to give me that trust to try using it right
so that that's up to you um don't ever let me get in your way of doing the
thing you want to do but this is what i've seen work time and time and time
again and so that's why i'm showing it to you that's why i want you to use it so
when you you come to me and in a couple months you're like leon
i'm not getting past that first stage of interviews and i asked to see your
resume and it's not using my template i'm gonna be like well maybe there's
something wrong with your resume right so what we're gonna do

00:34
is we're gonna walk through why i think this template is good
and then we are going to look at 10 other resumes and point out things where
i think they can improve and things where i think that they are doing really
really good on so that's what we'll do alrighty here is our lovely resume
template first thing name at the top we have our our title of software engineer
don't shoot yourself in the foot by doing your first version of the resume
with anything other than software engineer eventually
you are going to tailor this resume to every single job that you apply to
because remember we don't just click apply we network our way into
opportunities and so while we're networking our way into opportunities

00:35
we're going to wind up changing our resume so if you are not in a location
where the word software engineer is restricted then you should just put
software engineer on your resume if you're in canada or some place where it
is restricted put the closest equivalent uh to it cool alrighty
notice that there is no photo please don't put a photo on your resume
uh this is like one of the things that a lot of a lot of recruiters i've talked
to recently they literally can't even look at resumes that have photos on them
like they're not allowed to because they're afraid economists ugly no
they're afraid that they might get a lawsuit for discrimination and so if
there is a photo they will literally they literally are
like told that they can't they can't accept resumes that have folded photos
on them so get rid of your photo off of your resume um just because it will
cause you trouble with certain recruiters yeah yeah

00:36
and remember this is a very u.s centric resume class
there might be certain things that are that are standard in your country or
location that are not here so the bulk of our a bulk of our folks going through
100 devs are in the u.s uh and so that's
why there'll be some things that this is this this is just very u.s centric if
you're in in an area where they you have to have photos then ignore that advice
yeah cool summary room the summary is is quick
short and to the point but is often one of the very few things that will be
actually uh read remember does anyone know how long a recruiter
typically spends on a resume how long do you think a recruiter spends

00:37
on your resume i'm seeing 40 seconds 30 seconds six seconds six seconds six
six seconds so you gotta get all the stuff out of their view
that is going to in those six seconds not enable you to pass the
sniff test and so you want bangers only and you want to make sure that it's
clear concise and not something's going to take up their time
i see a lot of folks that will put a lot in their summary
don't very quick to the point here's a summary in ours creative
detail-oriented software engineer with a deep interest in ai
proven track record of creating implementing successful front and back
end web applications looking to bring skill my skills to a tech company with

00:38
global reach so let's break down why this is like a thing
i'm saying with a deep interest in ai do am i claiming that i am a machine
learning expert or an artificial intelligence expert no
but i'm hitting those keywords though that's for sure i'm hitting those
keywords right now ai's hot it's a good keyword it makes me sound smart
i don't know i have to know to do machine learning or ai makes me sound
like i know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i'm talking about
right if i if i'm interested in ai maybe i can handle your web app right
and so for somebody saying resume seo yeah it's a thing
all of your resumes are going to be passed through a a computer right
it's going to be uh it's going to be passed through a computer we have this
lovely cv compiler where you can try it i highly recommend once you've done your

00:39
first pass on your resume that you pass it through the cv compiler see what
recruiters see when it's passed through a machine
and so there are there is a thing as right
there there really is a a machine that is reading some of your resumes and you
want to have some some things on there they're going to help
boost it in that in that that metric and so ai is one of those
things and so i like throwing that on here deep interest in ai because when
people think about this right so there's two things that could be happening here
one you could be going through a machine at which point you just got points or
more risk realistically a recruiter is looking at this
right a recruiter is looking at this and going oh this is somebody that's like
into computer science this is somebody that is probably a good engineer right
if they're dabbling with ai they're probably a good engineer
and so the idea here is that you're you're doing two things you're

00:40
trying to trick a robot and you're trying to trick a recruiter
you're trying to get them got in the six seconds that they're going to spend on
your resume right and so a recruiter sees that and
immediately they're thinking all right better better person better candidate
then you say that you built successful front end back in web applications that
probably is the jobs that you're going to be applying for right
probably the jobs you're gonna be applying for so you check that box and
then looking to bring my skills to a company with global reach and so this is
kind of generic some folks might tweak global reach but the idea is that you're
just trying to like you like the reason why you're applying the reason why
you're showing up is because you want to work at a bigger company
that's it that's all you're doing here you're saying hey i wanna i wanna
i wanna show up i wanna work at a slightly bigger company because that's
going to be part of your story when you talk to recruiters when you talk to the

00:41
kind of the front line of joining these companies
so much so about you getting the actual interview is about the story as to why
you have shown up today the story as to why you have
decided to apply to this job and one of the common things people are
going to say ask you is why you left your previous opportunity and your
response is going to be well i want to focus on a product organization or i
want to work at a slightly larger company right that's one of the very
clear outs a lot of you are going to have simply freelancing on your
on your resume and so if you just have freelancing on your resume one of the
stories is hey i'm tired of this freelancing grind
getting clients making clients happy i want to join a product that people
around the world use i'm sick and tired of freelancing of doing that freelancing
grind i want to join a company that supports a product that folks around the

00:42
world use right and so this idea of the summary is the very first part
of crafting your story and you really need to think through
right you really need to think through what is a plausible story
you shouldn't be throwing things out there like i'm unemployed
you should be throwing things out there like i'm unhappy at my current job you
shouldn't be throwing out things that are negative in any way shape or for
shape or form you need to have a logical reason why you're showing up today that
makes the person want to hire you right that makes i need more money no
that's not a good reason right you need to give them a reason why you're showing
up i want to join i'm tired of the freelancing grind i want to join a
company that has an actual product that i can grow in i can go deep on i don't
want to have to get a new client every three months like i'm ready to join a
product team that that has great customers and and treats them very well

00:43
right like there are so many things you have to do to think through so one of
the very first things you need to think through as you're thinking through your
resume is also thinking through like your story and how does that story fit
into the summary so that people know why you're showing up why you're interested
and always always always always when you're working
on a resume or you're working on any of this professional stuff always think
about it from the person across the table from you a lot of folks snitch on
themselves a lot of folks talk about themselves and not the best light this
is the one time in your life where you're allowed to ball out don't be
humble talk your talk show the walk that you've walked so do it take that
opportunity right no room for for humble pie no room for
not showing the highlight reel you gotta
show out nothing negative no junior crap no anything

00:44
you gotta you gotta you gotta make sure that the person across the table that's
reading the resume in those six seconds go oh this person's probably an engineer
has no highlight reel nonsense if you're doing 100 devs you have an amazing
highlight reel already and that highlight reel is going to continue to
grow as you go through the program get that
i hate that that's like one of the like i hate very things very few things in
life and the thing i hate most get spicy real quickly
is people say i'm a horrible like like not me personally but they talk about
themselves and they say i don't have a highlight reel
and then they say i'm a terrible liar because when you say that you're a
terrible liar what you are saying is that there's nothing good about yourself
that you can put on a resume [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
if you've gone through this program so far
you have amazing stuff that you can put on your resume you have a highlights
reel and that highlight reel is only going to grow so get that talk out of

00:45
your head get those words out of your mouth they have no place going forward
if you're going through this program you will have a phenomenal highlights reel
that'll enable you to stand out against candidates like a hundred plus other
folks have done right and so none of this i none of this i don't know
what to put on here no we're going to get there we're going to get there
together but get that self doubt that self loathing out your mouth
that has no place no place today or for the rest of your
life because if you're still here you've done something that
thousands probably millions of other people have not done
i was looking at so i think i mentioned this during stream once before but i was
looking at um cs50 cs50 is is hands-down the one of the best it is the best

00:46
computer science course on the internet and they actually published their
numbers like the folks that have gone through the program right and made it to
the end and so cs50 started with a hundred and fifty thousand
a hundred and fifty thousand sign ups over a hundred thousand people engaged
meaning like they came to like the first class or so
out of those hundred thousand one percent completed the course
to me what is hands down one of the best courses ever made on the internet
i actually think it was like slightly less than one percent
less than one percent completed the course
so if you are still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] showing up all 3 000 of us
you're doing something that thousands hundreds of thousands of people have not
been able to do so we got to get this talk out of our
brains i don't know how to i don't know how to pump you up but

00:47
over the next few weeks you got to get that out of your brain you have amazing
stuff that you've already built you have amazing things you've already learned
and you can craft a resume that highlights those things and as we
continue the program you're gonna have stuff that nobody else in the game has
that are coming out of other boot camps that are coming out of four-year degree
programs you're gonna you're gonna dance circles around them you're going to to
to to to to just absolutely obliterate them and so
we need to end this like now so that's all i said my piece
you're probably gonna hear me do it again when we get to our like our our um
our actual hunt class but when we're doing this resume you all will have
stuff you can put on here no more of that jason derulo
thank you so much for the five gifts that subs hope you're doing well jason
gorilla do you want to come on on our friday with friends i think people

00:48
really need to hear your story hit me up all right let's keep going
anyone here could say something along this line creative you are you've all
built stuff detailed aren't it you managed to keep showing up that's true
software engineer you write code that's true with a deep interest in ai switch
it out to whatever you have an interest in if you don't like ai say vr you don't
like vr say something something else right but the idea here is that we're
doing the things that help us stand out proven track record and creating and
implementing successful front end and backend web applications hell yeah
you've built front end applications already you'll get to the back end very soon
uh if you've used an api then you've also built back-end applications cool
looking to bring my skills to a tech company with global reach you can
absolutely say that beautiful so we have our summary that will help pass the
sniff test and then you're going to notice we have
some other stuff over here we have our contact
we have our email our portfolio our github our linkedin and our twitter if

00:49
you're not willing i think everybody here has a professional twitter or you
should at least have one um and it's up to you if you want to put
that on your resume or not but it's on there
notice very distinctly i've not put a location
um notice i did not put a location and that's that's that's on purpose
um some companies dismiss your application based solely on the location
that you put uh and if they if they need to know
where you are they'll ask but you don't need to snitch on yourself before you
even get in the door so i didn't um put anything yeah you won't see a location
on a good resume cool work experience you're gonna notice the
very first thing about work experience is you're engineering work at 100
devs so you were a software engineer at 100 devs that is true you were all at
100 devs you were all software engineers 100 devs by the time you're in the hunt

00:50
we will kind of slowly start we'll slowly stop talking about 100 devs as a
boot camp and we will shift gears talking about 100 devs as an agency 100
devs is a real agency we have clients and we will continue to get clients and
so you are all software engineers at 100 devs and so while you're at 100 devs
you will collaborate with a team of developers to build modern and
responsive web applications using best practices you've already done this if
you've come to our project nights you have already collaborated with a team of
developers to build modern and responsive web applications like that's
that's something that you've already done you've built semantically structured
full stack web applications you have already done this if you've came the
project night you've already done this applied agile methodologies like scrum
for project management you didn't know you were doing it but there are some
portions of it that you've already done and as we get to the end of program you
will all have worked on a project team together so by the time you graduate 100

00:51
devs you will have your 100 hours project you have worked on multiple
projects and teams so all this stuff you will have underneath your belts
now you're going to notice we're going to talk about recent projects
what you're going to notice about the way that we talk about our projects is
that you should never talk about your projects
don't you need a assert for scrum no you don't i mean you can get certified in
scrum but you don't need a certification to like use scrum methodology
all scrum is is like how you work with other developers cool now
you're gonna notice we're gonna talk about our projects as though they are
real clients right and so the the clients we will whenever you build a project
from this point forward never build a project that looks like it
could be a boot camp always build your projects with

00:52
a client in mind even if there is not a client
build a project with a client in mind right and so hip coffee co
could be a project i did during a boot camp or it could have been a project i
actually did for a client called hip coffee co
right and so the idea here is you just want to be careful about how you talk
about stuff if a recruiter is only spending six seconds you don't have to
snitch on yourself and make it seem like you're in a boot camp if they ask you
don't have to lie you can say yeah it was an agency with a training program
and i went through the training program right but you don't have to snitch on
yourself out the gate and say that let them dream
the software engineer of their dreams and when they ask clarify but you don't
have to come out the gate snitching on yourself
so always label your projects as though they are real companies
talk about them as though they were real clients

00:53
cashier can take coffee orders from customers with their names baristas can
log into the app and see orders that have been made mark them to complete
orders that have completed will note which barista completed the order
all of you that graduate from this program will have built this app as part
of a team so when you graduate you will literally have this in your recent
projects happy notes users can log into their profile and
find their list of notes they can add new notes through an input which they
can edit or delete all the notes in their profile by the time we get done
our back end you will all have this project in your portfolio right and so
you might not name it happy notes you might not name it hip coffee co but the
idea is that you're going to have serious projects
that you've worked in teams with that are live that people can play with and
you're going to talk that talk so that folks
see them as real projects because that's what they are
and then everyone's going to have a 100 hours project you're not going to call
it a 100 hours project right you're not going to call it 100 you're not going to

00:54
call it the 100 hours project but it's going to be a project you sink 100 hours
into half of the folks that got jobs last cohort
did not have technical interviews because they did this stuff well
somebody looked at their resume looked at their portfolio looked at their
linkedin and go huh there's no way in hell that this person is not an engineer
brought them into the interview talked through their 100 hours project
asked them a bunch of technical questions we have a bank of over 300
questions that you will all memorize right and they were able to talk through
that project and people go oh you built this from scratch like you you you can
you know everything that happened in this application you have all these
other apps you you have real people that
you've worked with like good enough boom you get the job right and
so you don't have it yet but start thinking about what's your 100 hours
project going to be is it something that you're excited to
build something that you as divocker likes to say it can be something you're

00:55
excited about or something that you're that you hate
and you want to fix it and so uh well like i said this is not our first class
in the hunt it's just things that need to start thinking through
um in terms of your resume but also like get the gears turned into that when we
do get to the hunt you've already thought through some of this stuff
and then we list other projects here's where a lot of people kind of um
snitch on themselves right this is where people kind of snitch on themselves and
the reason why they snitch on themselves is because they list like their other
projects right they list their other projects
a little catch-up crew have these group projects uh yeah like i said we have
most of our group nights will be during class time but we'll hold other times
where folks can work in groups as well but you can also create a thread and
organize and catch up crew as well you know at this point you said it more times
than i have nah but you always gotta give credit where credit's due because

00:56
it's amazing all right so here's where most people snitch on themselves like
all of their like little apps they build
it just it just sounds like they're in a boot camp and so instead of saying
virtual instead of saying slot machine app you say small licks casino virtual
slot machine let me clarify real quick some folks will put
slot machine app on their resume and some people will put small lakes
casino virtual slot machine so tuck nato said so lie no what was a lie there
what was the lie there tell me what was the lie that's what i want to call it
did poker stars lie when they called their casino poker stars
did the wpt lie when they said wpt poker app no that's the name of their app

00:57
so why can't rs be small likes casino virtual slot machine
get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here come on now come on now
people brand their projects all the time so brand your project
maybe make a landing page for it right come on now get out of here
don't actually leave i want you to stay i just i want that idea to get out of
here don't just name like just don't put a project on there name your projects
every other business in the world names their projects name your projects cool
los angeles stargazer society apod web app with nasa api integration
i'm in los angeles i'm a star gazer maybe i want it to be a society and i'm
going to build a nasa app uh guess what we're doing on thursday folks yes

00:58
guess what we're doing on thursday we're building an api that uses nasa's api
so don't just say nasa api website give it a freaking name right
everyone here has built the next app on demand background color changer for
partner twitch streamer on demand background color changer for partner
twitch streamer guess what i'm a partner twitch streamer thanks to
y'all and you all built me a color picker it's the first thing we did in
javascript so you could have said color picker like some of these
people people will be like leon i applied to 500 places and i look at
their resume and it says color picker bruh
what's a color picker why would any why would any professional
software engineer put a color picker on their resume why

00:59
they never you got to think about it from the perspective of a recruiter no
software engineer worth their salt would put a color picker on their resume now
if you built an on-demand background color changer for a partner twitch
streamer that's a little different it's true you did you built it for me
so at this point when you're working on your resume think about how the other
person is going to perceive it i am always happy to let
a recruiter uh an engineering manager somebody that's gonna be looking at this
stuff run off and paint the best picture they could ever paint of me in their
head i'm not lying all this stuff is true i've done the work to brand myself
right i've done the work to brand my projects you can't fault me for doing
that but if you want to paint a better picture of me because of it i'm going to
let you if you ask me directly sure i'll explain

01:00
what all these things were but guess what it never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens
nobody ever maybe one out of a hundred interviews do
they dig deep and actually want to know the nitty-gritty details because they're
spending six seconds six seconds so they're spending six seconds they're
not going to nitpick all this stuff they're going to read it go this
person's a software engineer you move to the next round and the folks that don't
do this the folks that get uncomfortable with this part like only and i can't
i can't brand my stuff oh i can't do it guess what you're not going to get a job
or it's going to take you way longer than it would have
all right so start thinking start thinking through these things right
keeping it real i am i get spicy on this because this is the number one thing
people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this is like the biggest thing people

01:01
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and it's the biggest thing you know what it is and it's not
it's not that and we're going to take our break soon don't worry and it's not
that they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up it's that they don't have enough belief
in themselves that talk highly about themselves they
don't have enough belief in themselves to brand their projects they don't have
enough belief in themselves to build their brand right
and so that's the sad thing that's why i get so upset about this is why i get so
why i get so spicy with it is because it's not that
these people feel this it's not that these people don't want to do certain
things is that a lot of times with a lot
of my students there's something in them there's something in their brain that
says i can't do this i'm not good enough i'm not worthy enough i i shouldn't be
doing this i shouldn't be a software engineer i shouldn't be applying and you
have to squash it out it's not true if you're still here you're doing something
that hundreds of thousands of other people weren't able to do you're
building amazing things you've already built amazing things you have a story

01:02
that's worth sharing you have experience that's worth putting on your resume and
you you you deserve someone to see you in your light that
you already shine so amazingly with right and so
when it comes time to putting it on paper for some reason
we slip and i've done this in the past myself too we slip when it comes time to
putting it down on paper and so make sure that you take some time and if nobody
else tells it tells you listen to me if you're still here
you're amazing you've done something that hundreds of thousands of other
people have not been able to do talk your talk
put yourself in the best light possible because you're worth it and you deserve
it cool all right we need to do a break when we come back
from the break we got two or more big things we got to cover in terms of the

01:03
the like the last part of the resume and then we're going to look at 10 resumes
and go over it together we'll do uh some wonderful raffles we still have the
laptop at the end of the day so let's go ahead and do our our
five-minute timer but i think so i actually already
born code thank you for the hydration cheers to you and
omo show 12 added two minutes to the timer uh so this is going to be a seven
minute break folks seven minutes on the timer take that break
uh maybe try and pull up the resume template if you haven't been able to do it
and then when we come back from our seven minutes we're gonna look at the
last bit of this resume and we're gonna see some real examples i'm really
excited uh so let's go ahead and do that we'll do our raffle afterwards
see you all in seven minutes i'll be sure to run the ads so that folks
actually take a break if you're new around here and you don't know what i
mean by break please we're in a marathon not a sprint if you're able get up move
around hydrate let your eyes relax until it's not the screen i will be back

01:04
together in seven minutes i see you in different slurs i gotta run these ads
exactly as melody said make sure you stretch drink your water please i'm

01:05

01:10
gonna run the ads i'll see you all very shortly history
we want you to give everyone who graduates one dollar uh so
we actually thought about doing that last call

01:11
that's why we actually get a client though but um we actually we actually
considered that idea which i thought was pretty funny
all right folks come on back come on back alrighty
well no it's just so that uh you can say
that you're a paid software engineer but if you you already most of you will be
paid software engineers which is pretty funny alrighty come on back come on back
let's go uh come back to a raffle let's come back to a raffle so let me go and

01:12
set that up one second one second alrighty ooh
they're like crinkly in the music right now that
all right giveaways open go ahead exclamation point raffle get in here
exclamation point raffle to get in here and we're gonna finish up looking at
this resume and then look at some examples i miss like a raid or something

01:13
how many people here most of my people alrighty another 10 15 seconds 15 seconds
we don't get got we go get all right i'm gonna go ahead and close it out
and we're gonna pick our winner [Laughter] it's rigged blah blah congrats blah
on the raffle congratulations i gotta do another one i can't do that
well you're gonna get your you're already getting your mod hoodie but

01:14
you'll also get your t-shirt you'll get your official t-shirt as well
but i feel people would would say that that's rigged if we let that stand so
we gotta do another one [Laughter] all right so that's complete
and let me go ahead i'm going to do another one here
i'm going to keep this open for 30 seconds exposure point raffle if you
want to get in here folks for another 100 devs t-shirt 100
t-shirts that's hilarious well the funny thing is that happened to me too
um that happened on roofia's stream i think it was yeah it was a rufio stream or
might have been i forget him where they they ran the raffle and i

01:15
entered it just to run it and i won that was funny all rigged
alrighty can i close this one up let me know and and we're gonna go ahead
and pick a winner tony g three two three eight eight
congrats uh you'll be getting messages from me tomorrow setting up how to get
you these lovely t-shirts so tony g 32 388 congratulations
you want to know how i know some of you all come back a little after
the timer's done some of you all came back a little a
little a little after the timer because there were more there are more raffles
on the second one entries than they were on the first one
people just took their time they saw seven minute timer that turned into 10.

01:16
alrighty congrats tony g we complete that down here beautiful alrighty folks
let's go ahead and finish looking at our resume template here let me chill the
music and get into it all right so we talked about our first
work experience being software engineer at 100 devs we have our projects we've
named all of our smaller projects there's not as much as a bootcamp smell
and then you're gonna have at least two other positions
at least two other positions on your resume most resumes could be fine with just
three if you have a really established work history that's fine
i've had lots of folks with really established work histories and they
still keep it to three it's up to you if you want to do more but three's enough
okay because they're only spending six seconds
now sometimes they might want to ask questions they'll follow up if they have

01:17
more questions but sticking to these three is often really helpful and it's
even more helpful if um you don't have an extensive work history
right and so or if you have a work history that
might might have had a gap these three are helpful okay so
the next one will be your consulting so your consulting started
when you first started learning or thinking about learning to code so if
you ever thought about learning to code that's typically when you start your
consulting time uh if you have a big gap in your resume that was your consulting
time and as long as you get one client then you can you can put as big as a
consulting time as you need on there some folks feel like they they have
bigger gaps but if you wrote some html 10 years ago then you could literally
have been freelancing that whole time because your first code was written 10
years ago that's uh that's a little i mean that

01:18
that that's kind of how you can do it if you have a bigger gap this is this is
how you fill that gap and so if you have a gap on your resume
right if you're worried about that gap this is how you fix that gap you are
freelancing and as long as you have one actual
client that people can actually talk to that would like pick up the phone and
say yeah i worked with this person then you can you don't you don't have to
worry about any gaps anymore you just don't right and people right now
are the most willing to forgive gaps that have ever
than any other point in time i've been teaching the code for about 10 years
i've been helping people get jobs for like five this is the best time ever to
have a gap on your resume because everyone's like yeah there's a global
pandemic you probably have a gap or two that's okay and so you can explain the
gaps as like hey i was freelancing especially during the pandemic and totally

01:19
totally fine this is like the best time ever in the history of ever to have
those gaps because you had a global pandemic
and you are freelancing so if you have a
gap it's really important that you get a actual client that you can put on here
that you can describe what you did for that client in detail and that somebody
would actually pick up a phone people say hey leon what about references this
is where your references start that's why getting a client is so important to
this process it's someone that will actually pick up the phone cool um
how you describe your consulting is up to you but i like created full stack web
applications and static websites for different clients across small and
medium-sized businesses also consulted on seo and social media strategy some
clients include and then you would list your actual clients that you got
now the last one is any of your previous kind of jobs
uh raise we're gonna talk about that in a second we're gonna talk about

01:20
education in a second um the last thing could be anything that you did
it really doesn't matter uh you can put any of your past jobs on
here it doesn't really kind of matter um what you did
and so you can put you were did you did you ever like did you did
you work at a coffee company right you worked at a coffee company
and you like managed their like their twitter profile then you could be a
marketing associate at that coffee company right um
one thing i don't recommend doing is like really changing your title
um if that like if you had a specific title right
in in some more serious background checks those titles can be confirmed so
that's something to understand so what some folks might do is they might put
their actual title and then maybe like in parentheses some of the things they

01:21
did at that at that location right so if you let's say worked as a barista
you could put that in like parentheses uh so it shows like
your actual titles there but the thing that you that you did that you were
excited about at that at that company right so maybe you manage their social
media profile and while you're there you establish a strategy and communications
campaign that did x y and z so whatever the highlight was right at that
organization you put that here and everyone i don't care what you did i
don't care if you were a fortune 100 ceo i don't care if you were
uh an animal wrangler in the sahara i don't care if you were a priest it
doesn't matter you all have at least one banger that you can think of that you
did at that company or a way to think about it
that can communicate what you did there right and maybe
tilt it towards what you're interested in doing now
and this might be the hardest thing for folks to think through

01:22
a lot of folks that i always say most of
my students have done pretty traditional jobs a lot of my students have been
baristas they've been cooks they've been things and there's there's always
something some way that you can massage that role
into something that you did positive and
then something that might lean into what you did uh why why you're a software
engineer and for a lot of folks this is where your story becomes really
important so let's say you were a server at a restaurant like you're a waiter
waitress at a restaurant you would talk about your time at that
restaurant as having a horrible time with the point-of-sale system like where
you typed in those in those in those orders every day you had to type in
orders you hated it you thought that you could do you could make a better point
of sale system so you learned how to code and one of your big projects you've
worked on is a point of sale system that you're trying to sell to small to
medium-sized restaurants so you went from a waiter waitress having a horrible

01:23
experience of point of sale system learning how to code to your 100 hours
project being a new point of sale system that you're actually going to try and
sell you don't actually have to try and sell you just say you're going to try
and sell the small medium businesses that gives you a plausible story as to
why you're showing up as a software engineer right and so
we're going to have classes on this crafting your story you're we're gonna
have classes on how to frame anything that you've done in the past in a
positive light but you need to start thinking about it right you need to
start thinking about it now how can i take what i did in the past and mold it
into a story as to how i got to where i am now
all right and so you don't have to have that right now something i need you to
start chewing on and something we'll have a whole class on but this last this
third thing could be anything i don't care what your past job was there's a

01:24
way to to make it so that helps you with this new role cool
maybe running maybe we can do that all right
so like i said we're gonna have a full class on how to do that like crafting
story it's something i need to start thinking about right now cool
all right the last thing i recommend having on your resume is volunteering
i think the easiest thing to volunteer for are conferences
and so just have one one thing here that's like a volunteer experience
so that could be i volunteer at a certain conference every year the free
software foundation conference every year that was in person i volunteered
for the past couple of years and they also helped with like their
mailing campaigns right and so find something that's in the realm of
either like a technical conference or a local organization that you feel like

01:25
you want to contribute to that can be something that you can talk about uh
during your interview as well right so um there's like the the like
the charitable reason to do it but there's also like the greedy reason to
do it having the the volunteer experience gives you just one more thing
to talk about uh during the interview uh
no no non-code volunteering is great but you want something that is actually
technical related something that somebody else will be
looking at your resume and go oh they also do code for america i do code for
america every every tuesday right like there are a lot of these like
volunteering things that like people that are in tech are on the
in on right and so it's just something that like helps you
find a common bond with the interviewer and help separate your resume from any
other resume that doesn't have it especially if you're local right

01:26
especially if you're local uh and like i said this is just kind of
like the first pass we're gonna have a whole deeper class on like resume and
how to structure your job so there are like a lot of specific questions about
it feel free to ask them but we're gonna have other classes on resumes too
uh what about like like if you were managerial beforehand
and now you're applying we've had students that have gotten senior roles
right out of 100 devs uh quite a few uh a lot of times the like level that
you go into doesn't like don't don't don't limit yourself uh if
you want to go straight to managing you probably could if you did this process
right which i know sounds absolutely wild but i actually do believe it um
and so this part of this process is like crafting that story and if you've done
managerial things in the past you have to bake that into your story and use

01:27
that as a huge value add to the company that you're joining
the last things we have on here are skills um remember we talked about like the
computer reading your your resume and so you want these skills here so
that if a computer is reading your resume they like pass you on to the next
the next round cool so we have our skills html css javascript react react native
node mongodb postgres oop web accessibility these are things that are pretty
standard you might swap in and out certain things on here but that's about it
the last part here is education and i don't recommend putting education first
unless you went to like a really strong school
if you went to like an ivy league school or something like that or a top-tier
recognizable school then you might move um up your like your education to be

01:28
somewhere different but if you kind of went to like a normal
university normal school um you kind of put your education to the
right-hand side and can anybody tell me about tell me about what i've done
specifically here anybody figure out what i've done here no degree
this person doesn't have a degree um but if somebody was spending the six
seconds that they were gonna spend on this resume
would they know that they did not have a degree nah
they just wouldn't they would just see umass boston and keep moving right
they unless they were specifically trying to weed out for that question
they're just gonna go boop and move on to the next thing
and so that's what i recommend you do if you did not have a degree but you went
to school somewhere for a little while you can put that on there put the years

01:29
that you were there and then keep it moving if you do have a
degree you can put your full degree there if you have any like a like a masters
you can put your masters there some folks that might have like military
experience you can put it like near this area as well
you don't have to put gpa you don't put any of that crap on there um you don't
have to do you don't have to put anything on there that you don't feel
comfortable with remember this is all about passing a sniff test
if somebody really cares about certain things there's nothing that you can do
that'll stop them from caring about those things but what you can do is make
it a little bit harder for them to figure it out
right if they really want to care about care about it and they really want to
dig they will they'll ask you follow-up questions but you don't have to come out
the gate snitching on yourself you don't have to come out the gate like
immediately dismissing your resume and so when you see these folks that say i i
applied to 500 places and i didn't get the job it's because they have stuff on

01:30
their resume that the recruiter is seeing in those six seconds and deciding
to not to not move their resume to the next round
like i said i'm going to show you how to
play the game it's up to you if you want to play it
i went to a culinary school and a culinary arts degree which i put you
should put that on your resume oh yeah a lot of companies care about degrees a
lot of them don't and even some of the ones that do say
they care they don't check so it just doesn't it doesn't behoove
you to shout that somewhere in your resume
what if you have no education past high school you can leave education off of
your uh resume you just like not have it if you really

01:31
don't feel like you want to put anything for education just don't put it
some folks will put certifications on here i'm not a big fan of certifications
unless they're like the media certification so if you said leon i
don't have any education past high school what you're one of the people i
might push to do like a specific cert that might have
some meat behind it like an aws cert or something like that just to have
something in that space but that's not something i would do now for now just
leave it off as you get through the end of program that's something you might
look into but as a general rule of thumb i don't
put certifications on resumes um unless they're like the really big heavy hitter
ones that like you had to take the test and it took a long time to study for
yeah what about jobs that asks you to have a bs uh if
you've networked your way into those jobs it sometimes just doesn't matter
how relevant are spoken languages and where would you put them you can put
them in that like kind of this skills area is where you can put languages if

01:32
you want and different ghost says i didn't complete high school no one has ever
asked me about my education or even the bs requirements
so there you go one of the strongest engineers that that i know that have
helped all of our folks here at 100 devs that have amazing jobs there you go
yeah so you can put you can put um you can put languages here if you want what
about soft skills leave them off your resume notice that i don't have like
microsoft word or like public speaking right these are things that everyone has
they're not value ads on a resume they don't you don't need to put that you
know how to work a computer um on your resume like that that's okay like that's
assumed you're a software engineer slightly a little bit higher bar there
in terms of like your technical skills excel stuff like that doesn't belong on
a on a engineering um resume leave off udemy corsair asserts yeah

01:33
don't put them on there that just what is what is what is someone seeing
udemy cert smell like think about that if you had if you
actually if you absolutely crushed the resume
and then i saw you demi cert i'm just going to think oh you haven't been
coding for that long wait a minute i thought you were i thought you had
worked here here here i thought you've been freelancing why do you have
like why do you have like this this udemy cert
right like that you got to think about it folks don't want to hire
new folks like they just don't they don't want to hire folks that are early
in their career they don't want to hire engineers straight up boot camps like
whether whether you can do the job or not some folks have already made up their
minds about this stuff right some folks already made up their
minds about this stuff and so don't give them that ammunition
just don't let them dream what they want to dream

01:34
get into the position where you're talking to the engineers and then all
that stuff can come out later but you don't have to put it on here where
somebody's literally spending six seconds to decide if you go to the next round
always think about it think about what do you want somebody to see in these
first six seconds they can always clarify they can always ask more
questions but in those six seconds what do you want them to see so that they can
go oh this person's a software engineer i want them to talk to the talk to my
team let's do a few minutes of questions here
and we're going to start looking at some resumes and see if we can put into play
everything we just learned what about free code cam certs i don't
think they should belong on your on your entry level software engineering resume
you don't want i don't i don't i don't ever have my students put boot camp stuff

01:35
basic certification stuff that all stays off because in those six seconds i want
them to think that i'm a software engineer i've been doing this for a
while and i know what the hell i'm doing
so anything that might suss that out and
make them feel like they that that's not true or that you're a newer developer
that that gets a pass for now what about on linkedin i think this
stuff goes on linkedin too what about a cover letter like i said
this is not our beginning of the hunt class we're going to go in deep on all
the stuff you'll need for the hunt this is just a resume to start getting these
ideas percolating some of my engineering friends told me
that good companies will continue software engineers ones as an investment
is that a wrong way to view the job from our perspective no i think a lot of
companies the reason why they look for entry-level
talent is because they want you to grow in their way every company does all this
stuff differently they have their own systems their own processes and so
sometimes when you have engineers that have like a year or two of experience

01:36
they're already set in a certain way you can have raw engineering talent build
them up in your way and that could be a value add
should our contact info like our github account be really professional name yes
everything is first name last name as much as you can go unless for some
reason you can't use your name but the close to your first name last name as
you can or a moniker that you use everywhere is really important so some
people just go by a moniker but that should be consistent across all your stuff
what about soft skills management client service probably not
they only have six seconds ah great question should we stick to a
one page rule for resumes yes i think some folks like notice that
there's no second page here i left it blank just so i could say there's
nothing on the second page yeah one page or less they're only spending six
seconds if you can't if you can't craft a good
story that helps somebody understand that you're a good entry level engineer

01:37
in that one page you have failed that six second test
now this is a resume cvs and things like that are different but for a resume try
and keep it one page and there's some folks some people
that's out there nah they're they're not
spending that much time on this one page and it's not it's not because you don't
want to have more stuff on there it's because folks that have multiple pages
means that they haven't put the time or effort in to consolidate and really
think through what their bangers are and what they want somebody that's only
spending a little bit of time on their resume to walk away with
what if my education is over 20 years old just leave the numbers off of
it yeah just leave the dates off of it what about cover pages we don't i don't
i don't really ever do cover pages sometimes they're like cover letters or
cover emails but um we'll talk about that later uh where can we go to do our
participating projects we have project nights instead of class sometimes we do

01:38
project nights uh how do you add freelance products do
you put a link to the work uh yeah i think a lot of this stuff can be linked
so if any of this stuff is live and like hosted on say like netlify you can turn
these into actual links and a lot of times if you don't have the code live
you'll link to your github we're going to have a template that you're going to
use for every single github repo so that it looks really nice and really
professional and so that's something i'll share with you all soon
so every single every single project you work on is going to have a really nice
github page that's really like knocks people's socks off and so i'll share
that template with you soon and so a lot of these might be links to your github
design skills yeah that could definitely go on a resume too if you're like a
designer or something like that that should go on there
uh if we can't call ourselves software news we put full stack web developer yes
i think that's probably the next best step any fonts to stay away from

01:39
just use standard fonts don't get too odd with it if you're using the template
just use what the template gives you uh yeah it should definitely be a pdf i
think pdf being able to have it in pdf is really important don't be sending
like a word doc to folks send a pdf to folks
two universities didn't get a degree either should i put both sure why not
um if i worked for somebody that was a worldwide company uh you can just put
the port of call for your cruise ship or remote is what people put these days
so i put my resume online for potential employees i think it's important to have
it host it somewhere that's easily shareable

01:40
uh bullet points instead of paragraphs for all work experience uh if you're
following my template you'll notice that there's only one that has like the
it's like the first one has bullet points and then kind of the other ones
are kind of just smaller because you're trying to save space if you if you need
to fill some space you can do more bullet points
should you include technical schools such as like welding or cdl if that's
part of your story so a lot of times people say should i include this or that
well you got to think does it does it contributes to the story as to why
you're a software engineer so if you're ever um
if you're ever trying to figure out if something should be on your resume or
not is well hey does it contribute to the story i'm
presenting to a recruiter to a hiring partner as to why i'm a good software
engineer how i got here it doesn't make sense always think about if it makes

01:41
sense if i volunteered for a long time and they offered me a paid position can i
put volunteer and paid i would probably still list it as volunteer because
some people really do [Music] do deeper background checks that will
verify your employment history what if my employment deployments from a
different country than us that's totally fine
should we keep our age off the resume uh where is my age on this resume there's
no age on this resume um the only the only way you can maybe suss out age is
like educational timeline but if you really feel that you might be
discriminating against for your age you can just leave that time off of there
like your degree time how about personal interest now you've

01:42
only got six seconds don't cloud it with stuff that doesn't help you seal the
deal everything if you're ever asking yourself should
this be on there should this not be on there say if i only had six to ten
seconds to read this resume would that stuff help convince me to give you the
interview most of the time the answer is no
definitely always a pdf yeah always a pdf uh i'm currently a truck driver i feel
like it's harder to transition for folks coming from blue collar that's all cap
my best students the students that always have the best outcomes literally
when i i've tracked this i looked at the jobs before versus the the salary after
the folks that make the most money coming out of my programs are always drivers
always drivers always always always drivers i don't

01:43
know what it is but i i got the proof always uber drivers and cdl holders
out of everything out of health care out of folks that had prior education
i don't know what it is but drivers they they lead the way and so yeah get get
all that silly nonsense out of our heads that
if we're coming from one industry it's gonna be that we can't make it now um
data is not with you and that's why i'm saying you stick to these three
you stick to these three you stick to these three you have
your 100 devs you have your consulting and you have one other thing that you
did you don't need any other history beside those three to land a job the
individuals that use this template literally folks that we've talked about
in this cohort like the folks that i've put on here before folks that you that
you that you know that have gone through my other programs they've used this

01:44
template and now they're at fang companies like i said can you trust me or not
it's up to you we don't use those emotes anymore a frog
xqc wrecked our our our our place no more no longer in this chat i'm joshing it
but they did cause us a lot of pain [Laughter] can we ban emotes
alrighty so we've looked at the example what i want to do now
is knowing what we know knowing what we know
yeah it's like it's engagement thank you for the engagement
no so the cool thing like the like the the streamers doing what they did

01:45
was was cool because it it made the steak like it made it like
it made it fun right like because like it made it made you feel things
and so as much as you hate it being wiped out it's like that's what like
brought the community like your smaller community back together right like
having to rebuild and like fight it off like that's what made it that's what
made it fun and so it's all yeah it united us like so you
got you gotta take the good with the bad right and it was good promo
every good story needs a villain exactly all right
so we looked at this look at this resume i answered your questions about it
remember this won't be our only time we look at resumes and this will be i just
need these ideas to percolate now and then we'll have a full two classes on
how to do all of our professional stuff um for
the uh for the for the hunt um location for all this stuff you can just do

01:46
remote um some folks put la but i think it's better just to put remote if you're
putting 100 devs rockefeller nerd said i used this
template and got my job my cousin in college used this template and got the
job it does the job thank you i love that thank you for sharing rockefeller
what if i'm in la then put la
