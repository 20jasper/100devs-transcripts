always thought it was you got engaged hey congrats shrimp

hey glad you're all back glad to have you oh boy you know what
we're already 2 000 strong whenever we take a break
we always have a little bit of drop off and so it's good to see the drop off
we're still above 2k i love to see it i i have my worries i i don't i hate that
i hate to do breaks because i i know that when there's a chapter end some
folks peter off but we're still above 2k baby let's go i love it
i love it 2 000 i want a thousand devs that that's my internal goal i haven't

00:05
said that out loud but i just said it i didn't mean to say it but i said it
juggling biohazards hey thank you for all the gift it subs i appreciate it i
owe you uh a whisper i saw it i'll get back to you soon yeah [Laughter]
i we had a hundred devs that's not enough i want a thousand
and i'm gonna get me my thousand devs that's all i gotta say
i want a thousand i'm gonna get i wanted a hundred i got a hundred now i want a
thousand and i'm gonna get a thousand you heard you heard i wanted a hundred
what did i do what did i do when i said i wanted a
hundred what did i do i got me a hundred now i want a thousand i want a thousand
that means yes you you're here i want you to get a job this is it's a hundred
deaths it'll always be called a hundred devs in spirit we gotta keep that spirit

00:06
alive but know that i want a thousand i want it i can taste it i can smell it
i can feel it i want a thousand another one exactly
uh we we we've been moving i i don't think we're close to a thousand yet uh
but we've been moving i don't know if you all been in that celebrations
channel or if you've been in the uh twitters
people be getting jobs already and i'm like cool that's neat like but uh yeah
that's been cool uh and so i i think the the my goal is
because i get to i get to peek underneath the hood a little bit i get
to peek on earth a bit one of my one of my favorite the things i want to do the
thing i want to do at the end of this cohort is like release all the numbers
like every bit of data that i have i want to put out there into the world
because i don't think there's enough data out there i think a lot of boot

00:07
camps like hold on to this data they're kind of like afraid to show it
but uh i want it all out there because we got some really impressive numbers
right we got some really impressive numbers and the only other person that
i've ever seen do it like honestly was was cs50 their very first cohort they
released it and i think that's really powerful to be able to see that data and
so one of the things that i i keep a track of
is like homework submissions because i think that's the people that are really
here right we do have some folks that like we're a public platform we're on
twitch we do have folks that come and uh and see us
but uh when i look at the data i'm able to see some interesting things so
very first class we had what like 7 400 people that showed up
those those are the tire kickers right the folks that come along what is this

00:08
boot camp thing like what is going on but what yes booty licker has returned
booty licker hey how you doing hope you're doing well it's been a minute
[Laughter] oh i've missed you i really have missed you i hope you're doing well
good to see you [Laughter] that's awesome booty lickers and og
folks they've been around good to see you uh i i hope that you all come back and
and you know next we do another cohort probably gonna happen i love to see when
folks come back it makes my day um so i was talking about numbers real quick so
7 400 tire kickers not something i'm going to hold myself to first homework
how many people do you think submitted the first homework

00:09
let's throw a guess in there first homework a little over 4k
yeah a little over 4k first homework second homework 3 500 right 3 500
right so second homework we had about 3 500 people that submit the second
homework so that's kind of like my that's that's like my starting number
that's what i'm looking at right i'm looking at that 3 500 as like my
starting number and the fact that we're still at over 2k uh
right after a break which is always we always have people that take a
little while to come back after the break uh and so for me this is uh
this is pretty cool and those numbers actually probably inflate a little bit
because we do have a lot of folks that follow along at their own pace right so
i i actually kind of think the numbers we have now are represented the numbers
that have been here since kind of the beginning we definitely don't like come

00:10
on don't let me toot my own hair like we definitely lost some folks right for
sure but they're not they're not that bad it's not that bad
and that makes my day it really does because i'm always afraid to take breaks
uh when we looked at the last cohort uh the the breaks that that's always where
folks dropped off and so i wanted to start off with that because if you are here
you are doing what thousands of other people have not been able to do
right and i say this but i really need this to be like in the back of your
brain right that you are doing something that so many other folks set out to do
and they're not able to do it i don't care how ahead or behind or on
point you think you are by showing up you are doing more than hundreds of
thousands of other people that have set out to do the same thing have been able

00:11
to do so i think that's worthwhile to highlight to celebrate that after a break
it felt i know the break felt good i know it felt good
but the show back up they're ready to carry some more boats and some logs to
keep putting in the work to go through the trough of sorrow you
you might you might have you might have been able to like
you were in the swimming pool next to the trough of sorrow
and you decided to jump back into the trough of sorrow
that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] impressive there's not that that that that's
that's built different as the kids say right like you are built different
for for you to have seen the pain you know what it is now you know what
the trough of star you know what you're in for and so to have an easy out
to be taken out of the trophy sorrow for a week

00:12
right to be taking out a trough star for a week to feel good have some more free
time to be able to play the video games to hang out with family more and then to
come back a week later and say screw that good comfortable feeling
i want to get in the trough of sorrow that's built different
nobody ever can take that away from you ever
i don't care for the rest of your life how things go you made a decision
to put away the comfort to put away the things that felt good to put away that
free time to take time away from your friends your family your loved ones from
your hobbies and your interests and say i want to be a software engineer

00:13
i want to get a job in tech and i'm going to do what it takes to get that job
that's huge because it's really easy to not click on twitch
it's really easy to just disappear we don't get got we go get
so i'm glad you're all back i'm super happy to have you we have a lot of stuff
to get through tonight some some spicy review we're gonna do a review tonight
but it's gonna be spicy these these problems the first couple are okay are
we we're gonna keep it pokemon themed tonight so the the first gym that we're
going into the boulder gym right we're we're gonna be
they're gonna be a little okay when we get to that cascade gym it's
gonna get a little bit spice here we make it to the thunder gym oh boy
it's gonna it's gonna get it's gonna get up there right so just when i say that
we're getting reviewing but before we enter the review i needed to say
y'all are built different it takes a lot

00:14
to come back from a break and you did it so i'm happy you're here
all right we got some fun stuff to get into i'm gonna jump right into it i got
you're gonna have to let me get spicy for a minute though i got i gotta talk
about some stuff to happen people get big mad
it's every single time i teach people get big mad well especially
especially when i talk about resumes like people get big mad i got three
emails from people three saying that leon you're contributing to the problem
you're you're leading people astray oh no
no son i got deets to prove it i've been doing this longer than you i've gotten
more people into jobs than you i've gotten more people to learn how to code

00:15
than you nah son they say this ain't my only gig this ain't it i've been in this
game for 10 years um so you're gonna have to give me a second
i'm going to get spicy in a second not right now i gotta i gotta gotta get into
i gotta get comfortable i gotta get loose but i i don't i don't respond to those
emails they're wildin i get them all the time because people don't realize
that there's a system in play and i don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
about that system i'm here to get people jobs i don't care about no companies
i don't care about the respect of my fellow engineers i could give two shits
what somebody sends to me in an email i'm here to get people jobs and i'm
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at it and i always like i always always go back to 50 cent

00:16
i always go back to 50 cent because i ain't here to play in the normal system
50 cent has an amazing an amazing bar that always gets stuck in
my mind and his bars were listen you got to get in here close his bars were
i'm just a crook with a deal if the record don't sell
i'm gonna rob and steal i don't care about the system i don't care about
people feeling some type of way about you calling yourself a software engineer
you are all software engineers you are all gonna get amazing jobs
and if the records don't sell i'm gonna do whatever i can to get you a job
if i gotta sing a different song i gotta
sing a different tune if i gotta rob and steal guess what i'm gonna do it
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it we go get we don't get got so i'm gonna
get spicy i'm gonna get spicy i have to i have to

00:17
because because if i don't every once in a while i think you might use a little
you might lose a little faith so give me give me a moment to get spice a
little bit later on but let's let's get into our stuff we got to get into let me
get loosened up a little bit here we don't care if they agree they just
need to get out of our way hell yeah hell yeah
that's not financial advice y'all it's not financial advice
people just need to read more books they don't read books enough anymore
all right so we're going to talk about what's coming up
are we going to talk about what's coming up we're going to talk about
100 dabs and what it's going to look like over the next couple of weeks
people need to touch more grass we're gonna review the big four together
we got some spicy review with arrays and objects we'll be looking at things like
map reduce filter uh things that we haven't seen in a while

00:18
and then if we have time we'll touch on a little bit of objects but i feel like
this class might go a little bit over with the the two first reviews
and then we'll probably just end there all right
before we jump into it i always like to make sure i can answer some questions
before we get started um did you finally see batman now that's streaming i
it's funny because we had a break and i didn't have time to watch it but i
hopefully yeah i'll hopefully get to it maybe this weekend
what did i do for the break um i got an analog pocket
and i was playing some pokemon sapphire that was that was like the thing i did
for myself but it takes like it takes like five days for my brain to realize
that i'm on a break and it's very hard to not do work so i really had like a
two to three day break uh but once i did hit it i was feeling good

00:19
i was at coachella i was in coachella uh what's your opinion on reaching out
to a potential client to be a subcontractor like you are going to
subcontract out the work i do that all the time i think it's one of the best
things you can do did you get an overwatch two beta key i
did not but one of my students told me they got an extra for me so hopefully
i'll be able to use that can the u.s hire someone from iran so
there it's the the the way that we hire folks in the us is really really weird
uh we have an h1b visa process which is like one of the one of the bigger ways
to bring folks in that process is scuffed to all bomb all
beyond belief i've gone through it two or three times with employees it goes to
raffles sometimes where like even if you have somebody that wants to hire you
there might not be enough opportunity for you to come in so it's a hard

00:20
process um definitely something we'll talk about more as we get into uh the
actual job hunt which we'll get to in like two weeks we'll have like full
classes on the hunt and i'll answer all the questions as best as i know about
getting hired especially from other countries
can you explain more about the 100 hours project so we're getting we're almost
there um pretty soon we're going to be start thinking about a lot of stuff that
we're going to need for the hunt and part of that is our 100 hours project
it's a project where you think 100 hours into building something from scratch so
that when you're in interviews you're actually showing the interviewer a full
project from beginning to end that you've built
because i tell you folks coming out of boot camps don't ever have it they don't
ever have someone that's really theirs that they didn't just follow a tutorial
they didn't just copy it from somebody else in the boot camp that has something
that's truly your own it's something that helps you stand out in this process
i have had contacts telling me about paid internships it's something that
people are taking on at this time i think it'd be pretty hard to do an

00:21
internship and kind of program at the same time uh if it's a good internship
they're paying you well that's probably the better gig if
it has a guaranteed conversion the full time i never recommend
apprenticeships or internships that don't have a guarantee to full time uh
it's just kind of a dead end and they always have to be paid never no paid
it's a social media app hard to make in 100 hours we'll do a version of
instagram together across like two classes so like in six hours and then
part of your like one of your team projects will be
to build a social media app so you'll do that in like six hours as well so
once once i'm telling you it seems so far away
it seems so hard to like right now the idea of like what the back end can be

00:22
seems so distant and large but it's not that hard once you
understand apis and you understand a little bit more glue we're going to be
building our own back ends super quick it's going to be pretty easy
i want to say easy it's definitely difficult to understand there's a lot to
learn but once you learn it you're a beast and i want that for you i i like
the moment people like there's like the the biggest joy of being an educator
is like seeing that moment when it clicks in people's brains that they can
build the things that they want to build right
there's just a moment in all of my students journeys when they sit down and
they go oh i want to build this and they like i can see it like i can see like
all the gears they're like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i
can build it it's like they get like they get like sucked up and like there's
something in your eyes that just changes and i can i can see it i can smell it
and it happens for all of my students and i want that for you and when we get
a little ways into the back end you're going to feel that way too

00:23
and so yeah building apps will always be hard but it won't be like this nebulous
box that you have no idea how to do it you at least always be able to get
started and have a concrete way of going about trying to accomplish the things
that you want to build and so that's coming soon
and that's why we do the 100 hours project because that's where you learn
that you can do it cool all right let's keep pushing
all right so this week uh we have so for folks that were that were that
redeem the reviews so chibi and there's one other person that
reviewed that pulled i think a portfolio
review send me a mod mail please send me a modmail we can set that up for you so
if you do redeem those channel points send me a man mail we'll set it up all
right this week we're doing review tonight and we're doing the beginnings
of object-oriented programming on thursday so we're getting into all the
weird stuff encapsulation abstraction all the stuff that we've

00:24
been reading about we're gonna put it into practice give real examples uh my
my favorite gif of all time is well at least in terms of teaching it's the
cardi the cardi b but like why like but why is i think so much of stuff is never
taught about like why you would actually want to use it so my promise to you as
we go through object-oriented programming you'll know why certain
things are used why it's a best practice
and so that'll be on thursday that we'll start that
welcome mighty you found the right place the exclamation point 100 devs to learn
more all right next week we're going to put into
practice the stuff we learn on thursday and then we're going gonna learn async
await and promises async await and promises are pretty much
like the last really big thing we need to understand

00:25
about javascript before we move to the back end once we understand the oop and
async await and promises we're ready for the back end and then we're going to
move right into the back end so uh this week review op next week oop
async await promises and then the back end is this a promise you'll have to wait
and see all right you know squidward can throw it back mm-hmm
could we got the moves for sure easy all right if you haven't checked in
please go ahead and check in uh it's how we do attendance
and it's also how more folks throw how more folks find us uh so they don't have
to pay obscene amounts of money to do a boot camp they can learn it all for free

00:26
don't delay check in today please cool uh we were on a break
just so you know we were on a break which meant that i took a break too
uh squidward tina hold on paul paul this is a poll worthy question
all right there we go we have a poll just to confirm uh squidward or tina

00:27
just you know if you know you know all right so it was a break and so the
this is for who who's who writes the baddest code that's what we need this is
this is this is for going forward who who writes the bad code for us this
is this is an important feature of our boot camp all right
uh it was a break so i was on break too which means i'm catching up
and so i got through pretty much all of the mod mails
that were kind of like super urgent i'll
be able to catch up with the rest of the mod mails today and tomorrow and then
i've gotten through pretty much tina wins it all right tina tina wins that
was easy um we know they use tina going forward thank you very important 65

00:28
all right i've been way too long this is this is this is what happens
this is what happens when i'm not allowed outside the house all right cool
uh so i got through all the ask leon uh as a big reminder
right as a big reminder please don't send me dms
don't send me dms i don't see dms i don't read them there's too many my dms
are open uh discord is like a big platform for me
in terms of like other discords like there's some too many people reach out
to in dms and and i won't see it however if you post in the ask leon channel
you will get an answer from me or one of our mods if it's something
that's already been asked a bunch of times or if it's something that they
that they can help answer as well so if you need something

00:29
a question put it and ask leon if for some reason it has too much
personal detail send a mod mail that way those are the two major
channels that i i check all the time you will get a response from me uh if you
use mod mail or the ask leon definitely use askleon first that's the easiest for
me to get through i try to get through it every couple of days and then mod
mail if it has too much sensitive information dms they don't get they
don't get seen no cool all righty he's gonna get a little funky
i am going to start testing some stuff in terms of my setup uh i want to
uh i want to start having some other folks come live with us uh
and so we're gonna start testing like having other people here on stream with

00:30
us and so it's gonna get a little funky you're gonna hear me testing some stuff
feedback is always welcome if if the music is weird or my sound is weird let
me know because i am trying to change a lot of stuff um just just know that it
might get a little funky as we kind of go over the next couple of days um
oh yeah so for for the [Music] the merch winners and like the raffle
winners uh you should have gotten an a like a message from me on as a whisper
or the pokemon card winners i just saw your message i'm not sure if i got them
but by end of day tomorrow everyone should have gotten at least an
initial whisper from me and then stuff's gonna start going out this week so i
took last week to kind of get everything
packaged up and like all the laptops and everything from best buy and so things
are ready to go out so probably this week it'll go out it always takes me a
little while to get everything so sorry for the delay but you should um
you should hear from me this week i'm going to make sure i get to everyone by

00:31
end today tomorrow cool all right everybody said no networking until may
may is getting up close i best buy myself i buy the i got got
i buy the microsoft laptops from best buy uh
because it's just easier to get them because they're always in stock

where i get them though yeah microcenter's too far

an amazing resource to get your first contribution
we have to get one of these three things done
if you are contributing or participating in this
experience you have to get a client you have to volunteer or you have to
contribute to free software there's really no if ends or buts around this
this is what's going to help us stand out and actually live up to the things
that we claim right we claim a lot here right and
these are one of the things that we need to be able to claim the things that we
claim all right uh youtube is slowly getting caught up
i've edited everything and so you'll see

00:33
youtube go up um today thursday saturday so we'll be caught up soon on youtube
and if you haven't subscribed to the newsletter i share cool stuff in the
newsletter more frequently than i do on discord and
going forward there's some goodies that'll be coming up in the newsletter
that you don't want to miss out on [Music]
just by typing in newsletter you don't actually join the newsletter you got to
click the link to sign up for the newsletter so just just so you know
we're 13 000 plus strong on the newsletter 13 000 plus strong
and our open rates are absurd our open rates are absurd like i want
i'm like when i say at the end of the cohort i'm putting all the data out
there i'm putting all the data out there like i'm going to i'm going to give you
right now we have thirteen thousand four hundred and fifty five

00:34
uh folks signed up for the newsletter our last email had a 50 open rate the
one before that had a 52 open rate 48 53 56 48
ain't nobody else in the game doing this folks
ain't nobody else in the game doing this that's wild
that's wild i was talking to to microsoft
and uh microsoft said it's the the best they've ever seen
right like literally hands down the best they've ever seen their roi was off the
charts y'all showed out hard and we're i can't share anything yet
but we're cooking up some stuff that's going to be wild like never before seen
there they they see the power of this community and they're like what can we
do like how can we how can we how can we show up how can we support
and what can we do to like keep the train going and so they're

00:35
coming to the table we're talking some wild ideas folks like
really like i know i kind of ham it up sometimes i'm not hamming it up right
now it's it's about to get about to get i don't know in these streets
bill gates give us toasters all right uh discord we uh a big update
for discord is a lot of folks have asked recently
we have a lot of kind of affinity groups
and some specialized channels um but one question i kind of always get a lot is
hey how come there's no lgbtq plus like channel
we do have the study community which is new um but last cohort we created that
channel and the folks that were in the channel
voted to make it private and so we've had it there since the beginning right
but it's always been private and so what we're going to do is we're going to
archive that channel so it'll always be there for those folks and we're going to

00:36
create a public one um that anyone can participate in because i really hate
when people come to discord and they don't see that space for them and so um
i'm what that's what we're gonna do we're gonna we're gonna sunset the other
one uh that was private and make a public one because the study community
is already kind of public you had to like opt into it but there will be that
channel that we will see public um so that way when folks come to our
community they know that this is a space for them um and it's not gonna be
private anymore so that'll that'll be happening this week so you'll see that
open up i just wanted to say it on stream before i did it because it might
be confusing for some folks that are in the private channel cool
and then we're eventually going to do some discords updates we have a lot of
channels people have been requesting there are some channels that people
really aren't using or not really using appropriately so we always are tweaking
right uh shout out to the mods we have the best moderators on planet earth for
keeping discord that is 30 000 plus people strong now

00:37
30 000 plus people strong uh i can't tell you the stuff that the mods have to
do to keep that all running we have an amazing community
but when it's that big it's that public we get we get some
we get some some folks that want to come in and while around and we we we don't
let that happen uh and so if something ever does happen
realize that there's 30 000 plus people just tell myself send a mod mail um so
that we can help right cool also uh nobody wants to date you just
since we're here you give me a little time this is this is that we're back
from a break uh nobody wants to date you don't message people because you think
they're cute like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off like that's
that's not that's not this space um as soon as we find out you're banned
like you're never coming back like it's done so uh so please like come on
don't be that person i don't know why it happens right and
it's not it's not like something that's like rampant but it happens enough to

00:38
where i have to say it uh and so if somebody make you feel uncomfortable let
us know on mod mail we'll handle it uh there's no place for that this is this
is strictly for learning how to code i don't care how cute you think you are
other people are this is not a dating channel
alrighty ah we are going to do a live crafting your story class on friday um
we did the resume class not because i want your resume locked down it's
because i need you to start thinking about some really key bits of
information that are gonna make up your story
right and so that resume class was not supposed to be the end-all be-all of a
resume it was just to get us started thinking about our experience and how we
phrase our experience how we how we talk about our experience so that we can
start percolating those ideas in our mind
now the extension of that is your story it's the reason why you are

00:39
it's the reason why you're showing up in that interview
and how everything you've experienced in your past has led up to this moment as
being your moment to shine right and so a lot of folks have a really hard time
connecting their past self to their present self in terms of being a
software engineer and so we're going to practice crafting this live and i like
to do it live because what i do is i'm just going to
bring people up we're going to do this on discord i'm going to bring people up
onto the discord stage you're going to give me your background and then we're
going to craft your story live and we're going to do quite a few of them so you
can start to see how we can massage things push things around so that we can um
make it better will it be recorded i'm going to try
we have not recorded a discord stage yet so i'm going to install a bot
that hopefully records it i can't make any promises

00:40
we're gonna try it but it might glitch don't worry we're gonna do this another
time as well so we're gonna test hopefully it'll record but if it doesn't
we'll do another round of it don't worry um
but that's the idea so come on friday if you want live crafting your story i
think it's a really important part of uh program uh because it really does help
you to start thinking about why you're special you're amazing your experience i
don't matter i don't care what it is can be massaged into the way that makes you
a phenomenal candidate for pretty much any job it's about seeing your value and
articulating in a way that the person across from you sees it as well cool
kind of dev we're gonna at the bot that people sent me should do it so i think
we should be okay all right office hours on sunday we're going hard
on office hours this sunday we got a lot of stuff to kind of go into some i want

00:41
to cover some some harder topics i want to go deep into git
uh so we didn't really do our get bowl so we're gonna do our git bowl we're
gonna spend a lot of time on git github um walking through pushing stuff getting
more comfortable with all that so office hours will be at minimum like
the normal three hours uh we're not gonna do it it's not gonna be nine hours
once we get all the way through javascript we'll do another big review
class but i think there's a lot of stuff that we have to review right now
that doesn't make sense in like a longer review format like git github and all
that stuff but once we get all the way through
javascript we'll probably do a longer review probably like five hours at least
cool all right now it starts to come up leon we're almost halfway through

00:42
will this really be enough for a job yes it will be ask me how i know
because we got hundreds of folks jobs through this exact program last cohort
i've been doing this for 10 years 10 years i've been in this game
i've helped thousands of people learn how to code i've helped hundreds of
folks get jobs as software engineers the stuff i give you
is not something that i've just made up it's something that i've tested battle
test it battle test it right i [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up everything
me me eight nine years ago i'm sorry to those students i [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up
but me now i've learned some things i've learned some things
and i'm trying to distill all the things i've learned into what i am telling you
and i've always said from the beginning i'm going to show you how to play the

00:43
game it's up to you if you want to play it i'm playing a game
at the end of this game the folks that play it with me get a job that's it
i don't care about anything else the reason why i make up wake up in the
morning is to get folks jobs the reason why i go to work every day is
to give give folks jobs the reason why i stream for almost 400 hours last year
because i want to get folks jobs that's all i do all i care about
i don't care about companies i don't care about software engineers that went
to traditional route and they feel bad about themselves that want to be
gatekeepers to this industry they can go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] themselves i really
don't care now my methods aren't the scrupulous
i'm not going to say that i am the most ethical person has ever walked this land

00:44
because there is a system in place and i am saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that system
yes i realize that there are structures in place
i don't agree with those structures i fundamentally want to burn those
structures to the ground if i'm standing in the ashes
with my lighter and everything's in flames but all my folks have jobs i'm happy
and if you can't see that there's a system that you've bought
into that you're playing into that you're leading folks through without
thinking about it you're part of the problem it's not me it's you
i got a couple big things that i think about every single day a very famous
aboriginal activist has a famous saying i it's literally on my wall i have three

00:45
sayings on my wall this is one of them one of the sayings is
if you've come here to help me you are wasting your time
but if you've come because your liberation is bound up with mine
then let us work together let's say it one more time i'm actually
i'm gonna i'm gonna look at my wall and read it you come
here to help me you're wasting your time but if you have come here because your
liberation is bound up with mine then let us work together
i'm not here to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] help i hate that word i'm not here to help
that's not me i'm here because there's a system that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
and i see a way to punch through it and get folks that are hurting jobs
we started this because of the pandemic i started my actual work because at the
end of the day i care about getting black and brown folks jobs

00:46
that's that's what i wake up every day trying to do realizing there's a system
that created a 30 unemployment rate in our communities of color
that before the pandemic had a double-digit
double [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] digit unemployment rate in our communities of color
in the second largest tech economy in the world
let me let me say one more time i was in boston we had the second largest tech
economy outside the valley yet we had double digit unemployment rates in our
communities of color how do we exist in the second largest tech economy
that have double-digit unemployment
rates because there's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] system and it's broken so i don't care
about you gatekeeping calling somebody a software engineer
i don't care if you don't understand my methods because you haven't read any
books on pedagogy that's not contributing to that system

00:47
i don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i'm gonna do things i'm gonna move in ways
that are slick that are smooth and i'm gonna show you how to do it too
because at the end of the day i'm trying
to get folks through hurdles and systems that push against us
now i don't care who you are where you come from
the system's going against you if you're a non-traditional learner if you do not
have a four-year cs degree the system doesn't like you so we're gonna push
we're gonna do things that make us better than those other candidates

00:48
so we're breaking a system but we're better than the candidates that that
system produces everyone that comes out of 100 devs will
have a paid client have volunteered with an organization who have contributed to
free software will have a 100 hours project while worked in teams will have
contributed to an agile process will have a portfolio a linkedin a crafted
story all these things that their counterparts coming out of four-year
degree programs or other boot camps won't have they won't
so i'm going to read an email uh i i'll never share names that's not
what we do around here i i have no i have no no reason to do
that um if you know who this per for some real reason you know who this
person is you had a coffee chat you saw them on twit on twitter this is not

00:49
don't ever send hate somebody's way don't even talk to them seriously this
is this is not this is not what we do but i want to read this to you because i
want to answer this person i know they watch the streams i want to answer you
through i'm not going to ever answer your email because we're just not we're
just not there we're just not there we're built different you're not it's
okay let me tell you how you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up all right let's read this
and the only reason i read it is because i get i get like one of these a week
i get like one a week and i think it's important for you to understand
the the things that i'm thinking through right the things that i'm thinking
through um because it helps you understand why we do the things that we do
here together all right all right first first thing here first thing

00:50
you ready hold on let me get i'm gonna go to chat up here with me
suggesting that a hundred devs learners are software engineers
at 100 devs is very misleading those who will follow your advice might
pass the first screening but have a significant chance of being caught lying
in the second and will feel terrible about themselves if they get caught
that's why we do 60 interviews who cares we understand every single person here
understands we might get got on one but we ain't getting got on 60.
we might get got on one or two but we ain't getting got on 60 and
that's avoiding your whole idea that these individuals are not software

00:51
engineers you are and you are software engineers at 100 devs you show up
you go through a training program you get real clients
you you help real people build real code every single person that graduates that
has gone through 100 devs has at 100 devs worked with real clients gotten
real work done have gotten paid and just because you haven't figured that out
doesn't mean people are gonna get caught some people might not like it
somebody some folks might like not like the idea of what we do that's okay
hundreds of other companies that i've worked personally with don't care
or they won't ever ever even think about it
you are all software engineers you have all written great code

00:52
you have all written great code you have all gotten paid clients you will have
all gotten volunteer clients you have contributed
to free software and you will have done it while you've been with 100 devs
i don't get that i don't get it next next it goes on it goes on
it goes on and it just gets me because this is this is like this is one a week
it's one a week if it was just if it was just people just don't get that they're
contributing to a system that is broken that is oppressive that keeps people in
unfortunate situations and they can't they can't even see it
even though they type it out they can't see it all right next
the other issue i have with your approach is that you have no real rigorous

00:53
process to evaluate that your students have indeed acquired the skills
i don't believe students work as graded for example or that there is a pass fail
mechanism to move forward or relearn things therefore i do not could you imagine
writing this email therefore i do not think you can justify
someone who is employed as a software engineer hundred does has indeed
inquired the skills and is ready for their first job
of a set of interviews contrary to what you're suggesting on stream
let me let me let me say that's very very clear something that i believe
in my core of my being at the very core of my being the oppressed
or just as capable of the oppressors let me say it one more time the oppressed
are just as capable as the oppressors if you cannot see that there's nothing i

00:54
can do to convey my system of teaching to you
there's nothing i can do that'll help you understand if you don't believe that
fact because what happens when you institute things that time and time
again have been shown to introduce racial bias like testing
is what you do is you say i am the person that can judge you and
what you are able to do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
each and every single one of you is smart enough
capable enough to know whether or not your application does what it's supposed
to do every single one of you knows whether or not your site
looks like the site that i gave you to build

00:55
i am not the arbiter of your truth i am not the arbiter of your worth my grade
means absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
because each and every single one of you can determine
if you've succeeded or not and to think that folks are incapable of
self-evaluation to think that people are incapable of
understanding if they have done good or bad is just out of my mind wild
wild to me wild if one person's freedom is dependent on another person's choice
we can never be equals if one person's freedom is dependent on
another person's choice we can never be equals a lot of this pedagogy comes from

00:56
a book called pedagogy of the oppressed definitely you need if you're if you're
watching this you need to read that book each and every single one of you are
capable of determining how well you have done how well you are doing and you can
reach out when you need clarifying points or questions right on our discord
i looked i wouldn't come here and talk wild i looked in all of our help
channels folks get help sometimes there's a 50 60
message thread and sometimes you gotta ask more than once but you'll get help
code quality does not matter right now it just doesn't matter this early in the
game you're gonna learn so much more by building breaking and doing and at the
end of the day you can evaluate yourself you don't need

00:57
my rubber stamp of approval so let's let's let's read the end here
and then we'll move on we'll move on we'll take our break
i have admired your approach to solving the problem of misrepresentation in tech
and the ingenuity of your model and methods but with this stream your
initiative flips into being part of the problem instead of the solution nasan
the funny thing is you thought i was contributing to the problem
you are the problem and the fact that you don't see that that's a little scary
now i'm not going to give any context or
anything around this but i just want you to to see that and to see the things
that come our way to see the system that doesn't want us to go out here and get
they want us to get got they want us to get got but we don't get got
we go out and get and so the fact that you showed up here

00:58
the fact that you put in the work day after day the fact that you come and
write code get paid clients write code for
grassroots organizations contribute to free software
the fact that you will have an understanding of the tools the methods
the technologies that underlie your code that you will be well versed in the
efficiency of your code in both space time that you will understand the core
algorithms and data structures behind the things that you write that you will
have projects you have built from scratch from beginning to end that
you've sunk hundreds of hours into that is what makes you a software engineer
not what i say not what some random ass person on the
internet says not what somebody on twitter says at the end of the day
this is your choice you make it you don't have to listen to me in fact if
you leave now you never look at my face again that's okay i'm i'm happy with
that i'm okay i'm not happy with it i'm okay with it

00:59
i am not the arbiter of your success i am not the person whose decision
determines your freedom and the ability to do things what you want to do in life
you are a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] software engineer we don't get got we go get so
with that we take a break we take our break
and when we come back we show them how wrong they are
we show them how wrong they are we're going to write some phenomenal code
we're going to get some good review in we're going to put in that work
we're going to put in that work you're already software engineers you don't
need to prove it to nobody but we're going to show them they're going to see
we're going to see the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we can
do that other folks can't do folks coming out of four-year programs folks
coming out of the boot camps the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that they can't do because they don't got it in them we're built different
we really are all right folks let's go ahead and take

01:00
our break if you're new around here we like to be healthy we take five minute
breaks to the top of the hour we take five minute breaks the top of
the hour uh if you're able if you're able
get up move around hydrate uh for folks that aren't able to get up if you're
able to get some stretches in your hand if you're still able to let your eyes
look somewhere it's not the screen try that please it really does make this
marathon of learning how to code a little bit smoother let me put the timer here

01:01
lots of good review to get into seeing five

01:05

01:06
okay i'm gonna run ads so that people don't get them when they join [Music]
y'all spitting in this chat those who embody the problem will see a
solution as a problem ours all right folks come on back come on
back hope you had a good break all righty
how's bob still smiling with the man you scarf on the season a
all right folks come on back jason derulo hey thanks for the gift of sauce i
appreciate you being here i hope you're doing well

01:07
i don't know jason derula can we mention what's coming up soon
we we have it coming up on the books we're getting it on the books hopefully
soon yeah all right so one of our next friday we're friends
will be jason derulo talking us through their entire journey into learning how
to code uh it it's a it's a it's an amazing journey story i think you're
gonna learn so much from it uh so one of our next friday with friends coming up
very very soon uh will be uh with chase under rulo all right folks uh real quick
real quick just real quick you're here you're here at 100 devs
who's gotten a paid client or worked for a volunteer client or has
contributed to free software you just put a a yes in chat for me please

01:08
just put it just put it a a yes or something come on now come on now
we don't get got we go don't stop it don't stop i'll take the kind of i'll
take those hey it don't don't stop i don't know
what the heck you're talking about it don't stop
kc minus hey they've been 10 gifted subs
that's wild yeah thank you everybody for the subs uh thank you everybody for the
the the twitch primes a lot of primes today i appreciate it thank you everybody
um we're getting ready to oh so we have a
big announcement next week it's not this announcement um but i am ready to
i'm ready to announce how much we raised for uh rc last year um because i did my
taxes so i said i had to wait till we did all that to figure it all out um

01:09
show the music here uh and so i'm gonna share all the data so you can
actually it's not gonna be from me you'll see it and then you'll have like
the receipts of me sending it to rc but all of the
uh all the subs all the bits anything that comes from twitch that goes to rc
at the beginning of the year we already sent them what was it
over three grand at the beginning of the
year and so we're about to send a little bit more than that
for this past year yeah so thank you so much it really does mean
a lot um the the subs the especially like like the all the stuff was the
primes all that goes directly into our emergency fund and so when folks need
mental health support they can't afford a doctor or a psychiatrist or medication
which is ridonkulous sometimes it really does come out of that and we
had no emergency fund like we ran out and so it's definitely been a big help

01:10
so i appreciate y'all you know all right uh we have a big announcement next week
like i'm super hyped for this announcement it's gonna be a really big
announcement so i don't want to spill too much we're gonna have a lot of stuff
to go over next week um we're gonna share how much we we raised for rc in
the last year uh we're gonna announce something pretty big uh so next week
just not keep that in the back your brain big big things big things
all right let's get our review in we got some some pokemon badges to earn
here we gotta get uh get a little spicy with this review
so we're gonna go through the review if you're new here we always like to do
some space repetition some active recall and things that we've learned today's a
great class if you're just joining us or just catching up we have a lot of folks
from the ketchup crew that are joining us live for the first time uh if you're
part of the ketchup crew could just do like cc
uh in chat for me real quick just so i can see that you're here or if you were
part of the ketchup crew and now you're live
look at this folks look at the folks that are able to take the the break

01:11
be able to get part of the ketchup crew to be able to join us live and so uh we
always like that when we come back from break to do a little bit of review i'm
always gonna include review because it's attempted to how as adults we learn
but this is huge to see hey shout out to all the ccers all the ketchup crew good
to see you glad that you're here with us
live hope the break helps you catch up a little bit more
all right it just goes on and on i love it all right chat what's a program
what's it what's a program chat yeah i'm proud of y'all too a lot of folks
were saying they're proud of the ccs it's it's it's hard to be part of the
ketchup crew we're not gonna lie right like it's hard to to to have that that
that muscle to to go at it uh and to know that you're catching up huge big ups
very proud of y'all for sure i'll echo that yeah program instead of instructions

01:12
beautiful and the act of writing those instructions in a language
the computer can understand is a programming well
the programming language we're using is javascript we love javascript because it
is one language that we can use across our entire front end and back end so it
makes learning how to build full stack web applications quicker it's super in
demand and it's something that we can pick up together to build whatever it is
that we want to build in terms of web development
all right talk about the big four the variables the functions the loops the
conditionals we have a variable a variable enables us
to do what what does the variable enable us to do
what does a variable enable us to do yeah store stuff store information it's
a bucket holding some values exactly it was just to store stuff into memory that
we can use later on uh creating that space in memory is called declaration
giving that space and memory of value is called assignment we can do both

01:13
declaration and assignment at the same time let's go we also have conditionals
which we can check to see if something is true if something is true we do
what's inside the curly braces if it if the condition is not true we can move
on to an elsif which again will check to see if something is true if it is true
then we do what's inside the curly braces if all of our ifs and else ifs
are not true the else will auto magically run right it will automagically run
cool we can also do multiple conditions where we [Laughter]
so many people just one bingo you can do exclamation point bingo uh here in chat
that'll give you the bingo card for the day uh made by our lovely alumni
dab the bolacal and cross uh both of which are now gainfully employed

01:14
uh dab was also og member of the stream team shout out to the stream team
holding it down mine wolf wow wells rufio wow some bangers if you haven't looked
through their vods and we got we got another folks coming soon we got another
person coming soon folks i'm really excited we're going to announce it this
week the next person the stream team all right we can do multiple conditions
where both conditions must both sides of the double ampersand must be true so if
name is leon and status equals ballen we can also do or right where we can say
if the day is saturday or it's sunday it's just as long as one of those is
true we do what's inside the curly braces mega cringe
you're new around these parts huh uh functions what are functions

01:15
chat what are functions yeah there are sets of instructions oh i
love that reusable sets of instructions exactly
sets of instructions that we can reuse ideally like once we get like our
once we get into it really doing one action as a best practice and they kind
of form the building blocks of our programs the things that we can reuse
over and over again to do the same sets of instructions
our functions have a function declaration and a function call
your function will not run until you call it and when you call it you pass in
your argument so you call mom to argue i have a healthy
relationship with my mother i don't call to argue but when you call you pass in
your arguments those arguments find themselves
into the parameters let's look at an example here yeah

01:16
your pad wasn't on one second there we go so here we have our function
declaration of yell and we have the call here we have the
argument of hello that maps into the parameter of word wherever i see word
it is string hello cool chat what are loops what are loops what
are loops what are loops yeah they just needed us to repeat some
action multiple times uh so we can repeat something over and over again
multiple times we saw a lot of different loops so far for a while we even saw
some that attached to arrays like for each map etc cool
we have our traditional for loop here where we set up our increment we say
when that increment should stop like when we should stop doing our loop and

01:17
how much that increment should change each iteration so this would be starting
at one going as long as one is less than
five and each time we go up by one so we
do one two three four we'd add up to one
to five since five is not less than five we would stop and we would not continue
this for loop if you're new here we're going a little bit faster this we have
full classes on all this material if you want all the past classes
just join our discord i station point discord it'll give you access to
everything once you agree to the rules there's a follow-on materials channel
you can go straight to that pin post it'll bring you all the way up to the first
assignment and you can also join the catch-up crew
to kind of work through this material at your own pace as well alrighty
let's get our boulder badge uh so we have some
starter code here once again the starter code is on discord if you need it i
haven't already got it we have this lovely boulder badge here i'm going to

01:18
open up the javascript i'm going to open up the index.html boom
i have our boulder badge here and uh if we look in this javascript
file we got some things to do here like i said there this one's okay we're gonna
get a little bit spicier as we go on so there's definitely stuff for everyone
here to learn and like i said always say as much as you can done in the time
allotted and then we'll go over it together i'm
gonna put eight minutes on the clock for this one a little bit more than we
normally do but there's a lot here so take your eight minutes
try and get as much done as you can and then we're gonna go over it all together
time to get your fingers on the keyboard folks this is this is where we go to
work right put in the work try your best if things don't make sense give it the
old google and then we'll be back in eight minutes to go over it together

01:19
go for it looks like code wars abdom's added two minutes to the timer
we'll make this a 10 minute timer then there we go got 10 minutes folks [Music]
thank you hebdoms [Music] i'll getting too many channel points we
gotta we gotta we gotta switch up some of these these costs
just all caps dull down i wouldn't loving the pokemon team this week can

01:20
you figure out what i did during break thank you sudo katya a there you go
cool dude i'm really into it i've been playing around with it a lot
no five hey thank you for the gifted subs what happens if you run out of pokemon
cards not gonna happen the knock is just a it's a

01:21
something you can redeem for i think it's like 20k channel points
i think that's the first time somebody's redeemed that this cohort

01:22
good luck with the amazon interview uh ah so some folks are seeing that that
exactly that code wars grind is paying off right now uh jace
jason if you're cool yeah if you want us to give away on stream
send me a mod mail we can figure it out that'd be cool to do on stream
dakota simba's doing well they're on like a really specialized diet other

01:23
than that they're doing fine you got this uh
you want to make sure that you've like done like the amazon specific questions
and uh send me a mod mail just so i can be in touch
will there be another break during boot camp yeah we're gonna have a few of them
we're gonna have a break in june um for for a little bit just so that
folks can actually start working on a project and then we'll have another
break towards the end of program but it's really it's not really like a full
break it's just so you have time to work on your projects that's awesome blender

01:24
oh you got some folks coming in dunzo's already what get out of here
spending your free time on a dnd app minimal that's awesome
uh p it's not a test we don't do tests around these parts now this these are
coding like code alongs so we take breaks where you write some code based
on the things that we just learned then we go over it all together
tower if that's what you're happy with definitely count to my book
how can we assess how long a project would take um
you can try and break it down into smaller parts and think about each part
and how long that would take you often kind of just talking through it
with another engineer can be a good way if you've never built something similar
i often will talk to other engineers if it's something completely new

01:25
if i've never done it before i'll say i'll get a better time estimate i'll do
that and then keeping track of like your own i don't want to say velocity but
keeping track of your own like how long it takes you to complete stuff over time
will give you a better estimate of how long it's going to take you to do stuff
in the future drink we're we're almost halfway through
we're doing like 60 classes and we're on class 30 right now to a week sorry
around class 29 to a week i can't see your name because it's too
dark let's see oh multi hey wow congrats good luck

01:26
we'll go over test towards the end yeah uh which you can just put them on there
and the folks asked you can go deeper no idea tower no idea
talon if you're still struggling have you done every single thing that was in
our list we had that full class on it some folks
try one or two but they don't do all of them do all of them and then do them all
again like repost make sure you do it multiple times um
it's hard it's a lot of work doesn't come easy
have i blasted through more than 208 cues on code words for the break that's

01:27
wild congrats really one they're pretty public about what they look for
um so post maybe an ask ask leon and i can i can share what i know
how to hear max all right little less than two minutes folks
dig deep remember go as far as you can we're gonna go over it all together
also remember you can always just mute me you don't have to listen to me or the
music you can just mute me and then come back when you see the timers up that's
why i leave it up hey glad to see some duns coming in

01:28
has been amazing hey there there's a hump to code wars right like once you
get over the the hump of like how cold wars works understanding that you're not
always gonna be able to get the answer that you're not always gonna understand
what the heck they're talking about like once you get past that and you're able
to spend more time on the analysis you start to build up it becomes a little
bit easier a little bit easier and then you hit your flow pretty dope
dart i said what is your idea of an analysis on a problem you don't
understand at this stage just look at the solution never spend

01:29
more than 20 minutes on the code wars um if you don't know like if you're if
you're hitting flow and you feel like you could actually solve it sure keep
going but if you've just been like staring at it googling have no idea
don't spend more than 20 minutes look at the solution spend more time digesting
understanding the solution breaking it down that's always going to be way way
way i don't understand why people don't there's some things that i just feel so
duped by all right folks come on back come on back let's go over this together
there are just some things i just feel so duped on that i just put so much time
and energy into in my life that then to come out later to understand like that i
just did it so wrong right and i i love when i find these
things out because like your life is never the same
the first one for me was like understanding that even though i had
done very well academically i actually did not know how to learn i had a very i
have a very good short-term memory or i used to until sarah quill destroyed that

01:30
but i had a very good short-term memory and i was able to use that to get
through school very very very well but i never actually learned how to learn i
didn't know anything about active recall space repetition stuff would go in one
ear and not the other after i took the test like i just never actually learned
how to learn so that was like a big thing i was like how come this is
how come this is not taught every and every university at every middle school
it just seems really wrong to me then the other thing to me is that when i was
first starting to do coding challenges i used to do project
i can never say it right euler project oiler i forget i always
say the name wrong i don't know um which are like math related they're like code
wars but they're they're all math related and so this is like 10 years ago
euler there you go yeah and um i would do them i would get some of them
but i would just bang my head for hours just like not knowing

01:31
like how to solve it and i would sit there for hours and hours
and then somebody's like just look at the solution and i was like just look at
the solution you can do that like you're allowed to just like google solutions
right and then i just looked at the solutions and i've learned so much more
looking at solutions than i did from banging my head against the keyboard i
used to literally sit there and then literally bang my head on a keyboard
thinking that would do something when i should just looked at the solution and
then did it again once i understood the solution because now i've actually
learned it i've done the space repetition because
i'm doing it again and when i see those same patterns again i'm i'm like
let's just say that like code i'm i'm talking to the code wars
folks right now i'm gonna i'm gonna add i want them to add like a little line
that says like after 20 minutes look at the solution all right um

01:32
that like there's those things that like blow your mind all right let's take a
look at this together all right variables cool
you are getting ready to face brock for the boulder badge you want three pokemon
on your team that have each evolved that have each evolved at least once
you have bulbasaur which is at level five and evolves at 16. caterpie which
is one involves at seven and we which is at one and involves at seven as well
create three variables to store the number of rare candies each of your
pokemon would need to evolve uh rare candies increase your level by one and
then create a fourth variable called total candies that sums all the rare
candies for you so let's go ahead and create our bulbasaur candies
and we're going to set that equal to all right they're at level 5
and they evolve at 16 so we could just do like 16
minus five like if we really don't want to do the math

01:33
if we don't want to do the math we could just do that all right let um caterpie
hey thank you for the raid thanks for bringing the crew along
how are y'all doing what are we all working on thanks for the raid
hey what's going on everybody uh right now we are working through
coding challenges that are all pokemon themed so we're working through some
basics of programming variables conditionals functions loops and then
they're gonna get the problems gonna get a little bit more spicy we're gonna see
things like map and filter and uh some some other fun things to do
thank you for the raid hope you're all doing well i hope you all had a good
stream thanks for coming through uh for folks that are new we're running
a 30-week software engineering bootcamp where you can learn everything you need

01:34
to get a job as a software engineer welcome everybody
cool right so we had our bulbasaur candies uh how about our caterpie candies
cool all right and so we set our caterpie
which is level one it involves at level seven let's do seven minus one
and then let our last one which is weedle candies
equal and i think it's the same thing that they evolve at seven and they're
currently at one and so there we go alrighty
now the last thing we need is a is a sum let's do let total candies equal
and then we'll do our bulbasaur candies plus our caterpie candies plus

01:35
our weedle candies all right that's good to me and then
this way to do this see what we had to do with it
finally create a four favorite multiple candidates and sometimes all the
rankings let's just console.log to make sure it's actually working uh so let's
go to console.log total candies let's go ahead and save it uh if this is
working it should be 11 plus 6 which is 17
17 plus 6 was just 23 so we should see 23 right let's see the console
refresh boom 23 into the console quick mask looks
like it's working to us got that beautiful boulder badge
i am the proud owner of a boulder badge from the 1998 pokemon world tour
i got my boulder badge on the first try got my cascade badge on this first try

01:36
and i lost the tournament and i was very sad all right
i actually have like the like the official badge like it's like it's like
that big i should put on my desk i'll maybe i'll grab it during break yeah
and i got the first i have a legit gen one mew
on a flash cart because the batteries do die and the official certificate of
authenticity i know luxosaurus all right next one
conditionals and functions all right you have a charmander in your party
charmander can only battle if the temperature is above zero degrees
celsius create one function that converts fahrenheit to celsius and
another function it tells you whether or not charmander can battle beautiful all
right so our first one we're going to create like a function that converts the
fahrenheit to celsius so let's create a function here

01:37
and we're going to call it uh far height to celsius cool fahrenheit to celsius
and we know we're going to take in a temperature so it's going to say temp
because that's the temperature that's going to come in
i don't like using just the word temp though because it could mean like
temporary or something like that so i'm going to say temp val
or temp i just probably spelled out temperature there you go temperature cool
what's wrong with this though what's wrong with this function so far
yeah i did a capital f in chat i did a capital f it's not a constructor
function it's just a function no capital f good guys good eyes good eyes all
right so let's go ahead and then say let's create a variable called converted

01:38
val um or let's call it convert it to cell
and we're going to set this equal to and then what's the anybody know the math
what's the math if i put the math in in in chat for me math and chat for me
please temperature minus 32 times five knives okay so we'll do temp temperature
uh minus minus 32 and then we're gonna times it by five
divided by nine well it looks good all right so now we have our function
uh that can [Music] do the conversion but we haven't done anything with the
converted value what should i probably do with this converted value
i want to return it because what i'm going to do is i want to call this function
and get the converted value so i'm going to return

01:39
convert it to celsius and that way i know that this function spits out the
converted value so i can pass in any fahrenheit value
and get back a celsius value cool now the next function we have to create
is a function that tells you whether or not charmander can battle
so let's go ahead and create a function here i'm gonna call it can charmander
battle cool and so can charmander battle and we should let's see it's really
conversation no question it tells you where that charmander can battle so i
think we're gonna need the actual we're gonna need the actual value right
like when we probably when we call can charmander battle we should pass in like
the current temperature so current temp right so we should pass in the
current temperature right to figure out uh what the current

01:40
temperature is we'll have to call the other function to convert it but at
least we're passing it in so now we have the current temp let's get the the
the like new value so like let's get the convert it and set it equal to
fahrenheit to celsius and we're going to pass in current temp so my goal here
right my goal here is i am calling this function here
in line here so whatever gets spit out of this function
is what converted is going to equal right and so that's the idea the idea
here is that i have one function whose sole job is to convert fahrenheit
to celsius and it spits out that value and then i'm calling that function

01:41
down here with the current temp so it should take whatever the current
temperature is i'll get that converted value back it's stored inside of
converted and the neat thing is maybe eventually i want to create um different
different characters that deal with different values so maybe i can
eventually have like a celsius to fahrenheit like i'm starting to separate
some of these these things out so i can reuse them as needed all right so now i
should have the converted value and the next thing i just need is i just
need to know whether or not charmander can battle uh so i can just do a what
what can i probably do yeah just a conditional cool so we'll say if
convert converted is greater than zero if it's greater than zero then we know

01:42
charmander can battle beautiful else charmander cannot battle cool
i think that looks good we have the function chart can't turn
cancer our mandate battle we're calling our converted function and then we're
just doing our conditional let's go ahead and call it i did it ternary
definitely could do a ternary here definitely doable
uh i'm just typing it out i think it's a little bit more readable right now
all right let's go ahead and call it can charmander battle and
zero degrees celsius is 32 degrees fahrenheit so let's pass in 31
because that should be charmander cannot battle so let's go ahead and come back
here let's refresh all right charmander cannot battle uh

01:43
and then let's do 33 because that should be over zero let's go ahead and save
all right charmander can battle there we go
we did see something interesting what's something interesting that could happen
here well you return true or false for candy cane battle that's a cool idea
yeah if somebody throws in zero that's not technically
it's not technically greater than zero right so there is like this we have to be
it does say above zero so i think we're good right we don't account for like
zero at all uh it does stay above zero degrees and
so we're good with this but yeah something i did think about i'm like hmm
they throw in zero yeah all right cool let's see this last one here
all right you have joined an underground pokemon league in this league trainers

01:44
can use any number of pokemon print to the console pikachu i choose
you x times where x is the number of pokemon the trainer you are battling has in
their party i'd be totally down to start a pokemon fight club
i've always wanted to do like really big money games in pokemon
like big money games like kind of like how like fighting game
community does big money games but like on the line yay there we go
all right uh this is just i'm just gonna use a simple loop here
uh i'm gonna call this function under it's underground one word or two words
underground pokemon league and i'm gonna take in uh party size

01:45
cool so party size and i'm just gonna have a loop in here
and this loop i'm gonna start counting at one
so i'm just gonna set up i for increment we're gonna set it at one
and we're gonna say while i is less than uh or equal to party size
cool party size we'll go up by one and then all we want to do is to the
console log print pikachu i choose you cool let's just throw that in there
looks good let's do um a party size of six
underground pokemon league let's throw in six and let's see if this works
never speed underground was my favorite racing game that was a really good game

01:46
boom pikachu i choose you we can see it printed six times the console it is
working awesome cool first try alrighty questions about these ones while we're
here as always you'll get my solution code after stream why don't i have to do
partysize.length because i've already passed in it as a number
maybe maybe if we passed it in as an array uh so maybe let's see maybe if we pat
like if we passed in their party as an array maybe things would be different
right but this i just passed in as a number i didn't really clarify if it was
like a number or an array but let's let's just say they passed in their
their value as an array um so i'm just going to comment out this one here
and let's call it again underground pokemon league and let's

01:47
just pass in an array of pokemon uh bulbasaur [Music] uh we had what was
the ones we had up top caterpie and weedle all right so now they have a party of
three uh what's the only thing we have to change for this to work
let's do there's only one change we have to make here for this to work
yeah we can just add dot length here there we go
and now we'll see that there are three values inside of this array so
partysize.length would be uh 3 and this would run three times let's
confirm that that is true boom there we go now this is one of those things
that i want you all to do when someone folks ask me leon what do
you do when what do you really do when you're doing code wars this is what i do
with my code wars especially if i did like if i didn't

01:48
know how to solve the code war and i'm looking at the solution i look at this
solution and i go hmm what if it was an array
and then i fixed it so that the array works what if what if there was
what if there were spaces right like like like that idea of like
playing with this code right like you've seen the solution part of that
analysis should be to like play with it break it ask questions about it and and
tweak things and try getting those tweaks to work that's part of the
analysis that i do uh airasi said prep yes we'll cover
when we get to our hunt classes uh we're
gonna talk about prep you already saw if you were in hello rufio's stream the
prep method for working through the code wars and that's for like when you're in
an interview scenario i do prep until my eyes bleed um you know
but we'll get there cool keep pushing folks we got more badges to

01:49
get this evening definitely got to get to that cascade badge
all right chat what are arrays a prep is a system that i use for
working through all of my coding challenges
we're not there yet because we're kind of just starting code wars and we're
getting into it but once we get to the hunt like the like how we
start thinking about getting a job um we're going to spend more time on it
and we'll cover prep we'll cover star we're going to cover all these different
uh things that we need to do to do well in interviews
yeah razer toaster is exactly our toasters uh a data structure stored
as an order collection what oh it just stores stuff and there's an
order to the thing that is stored uh in arrays the thing that's tricky is that

01:50
they start counting the stuff at zero right start counting them at zero
so that means we have indexes that start at zero and it is an ordered collection
of stuff we like to joke and think about bill gates toaster because we can put
anything into bill gates toaster and it always generates new slots as we need
them beautiful alrighty declaring arrays there are two
major ways to create arrays one you see here using
literal notation where you just use the square brackets chat what is the other
way that you can yeah we can use a constructor that could build a race too
cool the funny thing is i don't hear the knock for whatever reason
i don't hear it on my output but i know that you all hear it which is
interesting i love one i love when stream finally
like when you all finally figure out certain things because that knocks it on

01:51
there for a long time i don't think anybody's really used it before but now
now everybody's gonna be using it cool so we got our little notation
when we declare our arrays we can put values into the array and we can put any
type of value we learned about so far any data structure so far whether it's
strings booleans numbers other arrays when we start working with our apis we
saw objects with arrays with objects inside of arrays like it gets wild folks
anything can go in there with our arrays we start counting the
elements based off of their indexes of zero so we would have our first second
third fourth element but if we care about the slot that they're in those
slots have indexes and we start counting those at zero so zero one two 3
and we can use those indexes to pull stuff out of the array so if i ask for
the zeroth element i would get zebra if i asked for the first element i would

01:52
get undefined why would i get undefined if i asked for
index one in the new array yeah there's nothing there there's an
empty value so that is undefined beautiful
not only can we get stuff out but we can put stuff in so i can go ahead and use
that index to put something into the array so here i'm putting string bob
into the array beautiful we can use the length property like we
just saw to figure out how many elements are in the array remember
the length counts one through whatever so you don't have to worry about
the index being at play there however if you want to use the length to get an
index you're always going to be off by one that's why we see a lot of that
minus one because we want to account for starting at zero
all right we can also iterate through our arrays we saw a four each where the
four h will run once for each element in our array it's going to pop off the

01:53
element and its index tint pops off its element and its index and
some of the other similar methods do the same thing where they can pop off the
element and its index hint pool and now we have a lovely cascade badge
to earn but before we adventure no peaks no peaks
before we adventure to get our cascade badge uh it is time to take a break
alrighty folks thank you for putting in the work thank you for being here thank
you for pushing your mind thank you for getting in this review
trust me it pays off in the long run they get this repetition in so let's go
and take our break well deserved five minutes on the clock
if you're new around here if you came with the raid we like to be healthy we
take our breaks to the top of the hour please if you're able get up move around
hydrate kiss some babies play with some dogs look out your window get your eyes

01:54
focused on something that's not the screen i'm gonna run ads so folks
actually take a break appreciate y'all for being here

01:57

01:58

01:59
all right let's do this thing so you do um you're all right folks come on back
got a a cascade badge to uh to win here this dominoes for you hey i appreciate
you thank you all right folks come on back
what's your favorite pokemon generation uh i i'm gonna get some hate for this
but it's hands down sixth gen x and y x is the best pokemon game ever i i'm
not a i'm not a i'm not a i'm not a playing for story type of person

02:00
i'm i'm i'm there to take names and and win some some badges type of person you
know and pokemon x had the best online of any pokemon game ever in pokemon x
you had the pss system where somebody in japan would like walk by
you could tap their name you could trade
with them you could battle them and then work all the way up to them being on
your friends list so that you could talk trash to them while you battled them
that hands down is the best the best system pokemon has ever had
but yes all right let's get into it folks
we have this lovely cascade badge to to get uh this one's gonna be a little
spicier if we go ahead and look in here go to cascade badge
index.html we have a javascript file i don't think i fixed the image let me
check to make sure the image works or not no it's broken let's fix the can

02:01
somebody figure out why the cascade badge is not loading
why is the cascade badge not loading i spelled it wrong yeah if we look this
is this is cascade that's my no i'm not gonna say anything uh cass
cast cast day cass cast day test caste there we go let's put a kick cast day
save that let's go back to make sure it works oh that a lovely cascade badge
all right i always got to be careful two things
uh one thing we haven't really i haven't i haven't done it to y'all yet but
eventually i'm gonna forget the script tag remember if you want if you want the
if you want your javascript to run you got a link to it and so you always have

02:02
the script tag at the bottom but i can't always guarantee it's going to be there
so if you're troubleshooting you're like leon i tried it all it's not working
make sure it's linked okay just telling you all right if we look at this cascade
badge we got um some arrays problems we got some some doozies of a problem
here so i'm gonna put 10 minutes on the clock for this one this is a lot of time
because i want you to go as far into it as you can feel free to skip around if
you need to remember go as far as you can in these 10 minutes and then we're
gonna go over it together all right we'll go over it together
we'll talk about some of the homework we'll talk about a project i want you to
work on and then i think this might be the first time we actually end early

02:03
alright folks go at it 10 minutes can i get the badges oh let me see if i

02:04

02:05

02:06
can grab them real quick right back me silky shared in the ask leon channel i
would love to see the game you've been working on
new horizons this is all harris heller stream beats
i'm actually in a pokemon fight club in discord
first rule of pokemon fight clubs we don't talk about pokemon fight club jeez
luzix said what are some specs to be looking for affordable laptop to code
with um there is a subreddit called suggest a laptop
just go there follow their rules paste the things they need and they will

02:07
literally find you the best laptop for your preferences at your budget
they're they're beasts with it so i would definitely go there suggest a
laptop on reddit a woven this is the cascade badge you
have about five minutes and then we're gonna go over it together
uh in a tech interview what queue would their javascript questions fall under it
really does depend i've seen eight sevens and sixes quite frequently i
think once you feel comfortable with sixes you're ready to like you can start
interviewing beforehand but once you're comfortable with sixes you're ready for
a lot of interviews not all of them but a lot remember a lot

02:08
of our folks even have technical interviews uh i don't understand question three
what you're looking for and we're gonna go over in depth is
does the index like can the index go into that number like is it like can you
can't divide by zero so it doesn't count but one one can go into six uh two can
go into 32 3 can't go in the 82 4 can't go into 9
but 5 can go into 25 so that's what you're looking for

02:09
we're gonna don't worry we're going to break that down if that's too soon
yeah i think i think it's really important my recommendation for a laptop
is hold out as long as you can until you get a job because the job will most
likely give you a laptop anyway so i'm a big fan of getting an old
chromebook the crispy nuggets at it an old chromebook
put linux on it and that's enough for web development uh an old thinkpad an
x220 x230 put gnu linux on it and called a day
that's that's enough to get you through learning um you don't have to spend more
than 150 if you need a laptop uh to do well
get a job and then they'll give you a better one
you need a laptop for interviews uh nowadays yes because a lot of them are
still remote or something that you can write code on i should say
you attended a virtual conference and won a macbook pro that's awesome

02:10
[Laughter] montana said or buy it from costco and return way later shh
we've talked about we've talked about the best buy loner program here on
stream before well i have not yet but i will it has been a while my apologies
that's awesome cloud so the so if you're a best buy rewards
member you get a month and then if you're like a like the next

02:11
tier up it's like 60 days um yeah costco is probably better because they
they take it back whenever be careful you're gonna get another
email yeah i'm releasing too many of the secrets this evening
uh worldsworth you can do anki totally in the browser you don't need to
download anything for anki just use the web version yeah
dragon said after two weeks they try to stick you every stocking fee be careful
there are certain things that do over stocky beats that's that's why that the
best buy loaner program used to be way better but they kind of caught on yeah
costco is 90 days for electronics that's good to know yeah this is not financial

02:12
advice folks make sure you read the policies
i'm down cloud i think definitely by the
end of this cohort it'd be great to have
all right 20 more seconds we're going to go over it together
alrighty come on in come on in let's go over this together folks all right

02:13
so folks asked here is my competition badge or the nintendo training tour
in 1999 yes yes believe it or not uh i don't know where i actually have
two boulder badges so this is the boulder badge
and i don't know where my other boulder badge or the cascade is because we move
some stuff around i'll probably find it take another break but
um so i have the cascade badge and then folks this is it the mega memory card
that has the gen one mew i have the official certificate of
authenticity that matches it as well i don't know where that's at the moment
but i have it this is like all right and it's backed up on an original gen
blue cart with a fresh battery i'm gonna say

02:14
all right my flexosaurus is coming out people people ask me leon is pokemon
thing is this new for you i'm like nah son
i've been in the pokemon since this this
this is this is this is og pokemon stuff right here toys r us
sent out a vhs tape hyping up the the the franchise before it even came out
before the franchise even came out before toys r us even had anything
they had this vhs tape that they sent out
and i used to watch that vhs tape every single day and be like this shit's gonna
be amazing and then i couldn't i didn't get the game when it came out
because didn't have funds like that but johnny i'm not going to say their last
name they let me borrow their pokemon blue i i
i looked that's the only time i ever talked wild to my mama because she was
like leon time to go to bed and i'm like ah i gotta catch i gotta catch the
pokemons as i was like sitting underneath the lamp in my living room um

02:15
so yeah shout out to johnny johnny c i'll just say that you're a real one and
then eventually i got my pokemon blue and it's been in a wrap
alrighty erase your pokemon party order which is a list of pokemon right which
is a list of pokemon has been leaked to misty i forget when i write this stuff
please create a function that reverses your list and prints it out to the
console so when you're battling you don't want people to figure out your
your pokemon order and so misty has figured out our party order and we have
to reverse our our our list of names so i'm hearing some words here i'm
hearing list of names so far what we learned in javascript
when we hear like a bunch of names what am i going to use here
yeah i'm going to use an array so i'm going to have a function that takes in

02:16
an array and i'm going to want to return the or so i'm going to want to print
this to the console the reverse of the array and some folks in chat already saw
it so let's go ahead let's create a function we're going to call this reverse
party and we're going to take in our party list
and we're going to return the reverse of it return
and we could probably just do it like this party list sorry i keep saying
return we want to we want to console.log it console.log
and we want to console.log partylist.reverse reverse reverse cool
so that should take whatever the array is and reverse it now a lot of folks
kind of get tripped up with the reverse because uh reverse is a what method it's
a method that works with what every body clap your hand

02:17
yeah it works with a raise and so some folks get tripped up because they're so
used to doing split reverse join that they don't realize that it's not a
string method it's an array method that split method is what takes the string
and turns it into an array for you to reverse if you're doing that palindrome
question that shows up all the time on cold wars
i keep writing retards i'm so used to code words me too yeah comes in a lot
all right so let's go ahead and make sure this works let's go ahead and call
our function reverse party and we're going to pass in
an array and so let's pass in an array of pokemon bulba charmander pika chu and
butter for butter free there we go all right so let's save this and let's
go and open this one in the browser make sure it works

02:18
and i'm going to put the console i'm going to refresh i don't see anything oh
i see butter pikachu bulba there we go cool we called it
and we saw that butter was first then pika then char than bulba so it has
actually reversed our array of pokemon cool
i did the exact same array that's wild all right so that first one done so
let's keep pushing here all right create all right given two integer arrays
a and b both of length of greater than one create a program that returns true if
the sum of the squares of each element is strictly greater than the sum of the
cubes of each element in b i thought this was pokemon i thought we
were playing here all right let's take it let's read this

02:19
out a little bit see if we can get what the heck's going on here all right
leon no math also leon this mess we gotta so so the reason why i gotta
mix some of these in i gotta pepper them
in is because this is the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're
gonna see during interviews right the reason why codewars is so helpful
is not that you get better at programming not that you can like write
code more efficiently but it's the fact that you can actually understand when
these types of questions are being asked to you
because the first i don't know say 100 code wars that you do
it's really the phrasing that gets you right it's really the phrasing that can
get you and in an interview right in an interview where they're
saying this nonsense to you and you're a
little hype you're a little i don't know
a little nervous right it can just it it happens to a lot of us you'll just kind

02:20
of glaze out right and so you want to get comfortable with these phrases with
these terms with the way of the questions being asked to you and that's
where code wars really can can help eventually we'll get the lead code of
course but the the phrasing is something you pick up by doing these code wars
over and over again so it's not a shock to the system when you see it if you saw
this question and you were like that means you need to do more code worse
you know it will help with that shock to the system the phrasing is definitely
probably the worst part cool all right given two integer arrays when
somebody says integer arrays what does that mean true integer arrays is what
what am i just saying there yeah an array of numbers so i have two arrays
that are full of numbers one is going to be called a the other is going to be
called b and they're going to both have at least
one number in it so all this means is that we have two array of numbers one

02:21
called a one called b they're both at least greater they both have at least
one number in them and we're going to create a program that returns the sum
of all the squares of each number in a so we're going to add a bunch of numbers
together to get a sum but we're squaring each number that was in the array and
then adding it to the sum right so if we had an array that had two numbers in it
right two and three we would square the two we would square the three
right so this would be four and this would be nine and then we would
add them together and we would have 13. right so we're we're going to sum
all the numbers but after we squared them so whenever i know i'm going to keep
like a sum i'm doing something over and over again

02:22
uh what am i going to use here what's the method that screams out in your mind
as soon as i say i got to sum something yeah reduce comes to my brain
i think i'm going to do two reduces one reduced for the squares and the
first array and another reduce for the cubes on the second array
and then i'm just going to compare them so i actually think this is just going
to be uh i think i could probably like just create a function here
uh we're going to call this compare square and cube
and we know we're going to pass in two arrays
and they've already given us the name for these arrays or the names of our
parameters a and b and i'm just going to return
the reduction of a and b and just throw a greater sign in there i'm going to
have this greater sign so i'm going to i'm going to have the a reduction so a

02:23
dot reduce on this side and i'm going to see if that's greater than the b
reduce on this side that's it so i'm we have to fill in what's in the reduce but
that's the idea a will reduce down to a sum
and b will reduce down to a sum and then i'm going to compare
if the a reduction is greater than the b reduction
cool we know that our reduce takes in two parameters we just kind of know that
syntax what are the two parameters that we always have with the reduce chat
yeah we got our accumulator and our current value
and then all we're going to do is add to
that accumulation so we know we're going to keep adding to that accumulation
but what are we going to add to this accumulation what are we going to keep
adding to this accumulation it's not just the current number what

02:24
are we doing to that current number yeah we're squaring that current value
so this one we're squaring it so there are tons of ways to square we
could do math dot pow and take in the current value and say do
it to the second power uh in this case we could just do uh c times c
that would work that'd be a square right and we can also do the other shorthand
that we learned i think a couple classes ago of the square the
that shorthand for square so astric asterisk 2 is shorthand for squaring um
and then just to be safe i'm going to put my zero at the end here
and that zero is just gonna it's just gonna help me with what
just it's just helping me if there's a there's a certain what
yeah it helps with the initial value specifically of the accumulator so we

02:25
don't deal with is it a string is it a number right it gives us initial value
to start with it helps us with the type conversion there's a lot of goodies that
we can get by by having that number there to start so we're just going to
put it there um and we should be good especially since we know that we're
adding to the accumulator cool and then the second reduce is almost the
exact same thing we have another accumulator and another current value
and we're going to add to this accumulator but this time it's going to
be a what it's not going to be a square it's going to be a what
a cube exactly put our zero there to protect ourselves and this looks good i
think we can kind of make this smaller just to see it on one line
i definitely i'll make it bigger again i just want to have it all one line as we

02:26
talk about it a little bit bigger there we go yeah so for now have it
online but we'll make it bigger in a second so the idea here
is we can eventually call this function uh compare square and cube and we can
pass in two arrays and i'm gonna pass in two arrays that
are exactly the same i was gonna do two two two just to make my math easier and
two two two here all right so let's let's break this down
i did not study it off my break no no no this is just code wars tomfoolery here
let's take a look let's walk through it we'll we'll
this we wouldn't be able to see the result on this one so let's just talk
through it first all right so this first array this two two two array

02:27
falls into a wherever i see a it's that first array so here's this first array a
and we're running on a we're running a reduction of it we're reducing it and so
reduce always returns what reduce returns what
a singular value right it returns a singular value so it reduces all the way
down into one value and so we know out of this reduction will be a singular
value right and so what we're going to do is we are going to
start off with an accumulation that we are going to start adding to
so the very first time this runs r2 is the first value of c
and we've gone ahead and created an accumulator that starts off at what

02:28
zero we have our accumulator starting off at zero we're gonna pass in two
all right so zero plus two squared so that's what two squared is what four
so we add four to our accumulation and so now our accumulation is no longer
zero it is now four and then we run again
we pass two n is the second iteration of c we're going to do it again where we
square 2 which is 4 but now we're adding 4 to the previous 4 and we are at 8.
the very last time this runs we pass in 2 again
we're going to square 2 again we add that 2 to our accumulation
and we're no longer at 8 we are at 12. so this first value

02:29
this whole reduction reduces all the way down to what 12
right reduces all the way down to 12. great now let's look at the other side
we have b reduce so now we're going to call if we see b here we see that b
is the second array wherever i see b it's that array
so it's the same thing as if i had plugged that array in here it's the same
thing as 2 2 2 being here right we're reducing that array instead of having it
there instead of it having there we have the parameter of b
all right now the very first time this runs our accumulator is at zero
and we're gonna take our two we're to plug it in and 2 to the third

02:30
gives us what 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 2 is 8. all right so our first value is 8
and we add that to the accumulation so our accumulation
is eight after the first run then we know we're gonna pass in two again
that's another eight so plus eight we're at sixteen
and then the last two gets entered in a c we wind up generating another eight
adding eight to 16 and we're at 24. now we can do it on the abacus if we need to
so we can go ahead and start over again and we're going to go ahead and reduce

02:31
our all right so this is it's an abacus you know why it's an abacus
because in the west we are taught how to count wrong
here let me let me demonstrate to you uh that you probably count wrong
when i say seven plus five what do you do a lot of folks are gonna do this
right there lockwood's gonna do that a lot of folks in our brain will be like
all right seven plus five so that's that's we chop the
five into a three that gives us a ten and then we have the two left over so we
add the two to the ten right that's just like the wrong way to think about math
like that's so much extra work to do very simple like math but that's just
like how we grow up being taught math we are literally taught math wrong

02:32
uh so i'm working on learning how to do math correctly
and that's why i have an abacus on my desk i want to think about numbers in a
better way abacus class once i get better at it i may be
all right so this was this is hard if you haven't seen reduce yet
uh it is difficult if you are still kind of learning some of the basic methods
we've given a lot of homework that had these methods already in it and you're
going to see these over and over in code wars you have
to know these methods reduce just has to be something that you're comfortable
with you can use over and over and over again and so
make sure if you're not comfortable with reduce
you go to the mdn you spend time going through it you make sure that you then
practice your reduced methods on code wars you can type in reduce and find

02:33
problems that just use reduce and practice them over and over and over again
right like wait how do we count leon you can't
leave us like that uh maybe on maybe during office hours we could i can
demonstrate some some quick maths to you all right
so what we did here is we did two reductions right we reduced a
to a sum we reduce b to a sum we are seeing the lovely um
shorthand syntax the square and cube and let's go ahead and make sure this
actually works got a console log it because we we

02:34
didn't really do anything with the value there we go all right let's save it
let's go back let's refresh all right and it's false right it makes
sense that it's false right that the the cube would be um
that sorry that the square would be greater than the cube we know
that that's false so it worked right we know that a squared
is always probably going to be less than b squared when it's the it is going to
be less when it's the same exact numbers right that's all
now we could start mixing it up we could start throwing in other numbers here
right like we could keep this two two two but make this like four four five
all right save that and then that's definitely true right

02:35
the the bigger number squared is better than the or sorry bigger than the
smaller numbers cubed cool all righty next one here actually let's just let's
just breathe i just want to say one more second on this one and then we'll move
on so we have the idea here this reduce the reduce all it does and if you're if
you're struggling with reduce just know it's the same thing every
single time i think that's the big thing
with these with these methods is that we
think that it's it's the trick or you're going to get got no it's the it's the
exact same thing every single time right and so there's always going to be
an accumulator there's always going to be a current value right
right is always going to be greater there's always been accumulators always
going to be a current value what you do to that accumulator like do we add these

02:36
values do we subtract them multiply them divide them that's what can change so
what we decided to do here is that we cube every number sorry we square each
number and then add it to this pile of numbers right so we add it to a sum we
have a sum that's being kept here so we keep adding numbers summing summing
summing over here we did the exact same thing we're keeping a sum but we're
adding the cubes each time cube add cubed key bad cube ad yeah
should i be up creating a new repository each time i upload my daily code wars
challenges no you only need like one repo and then what i recommend is once you
have that one repository just create a new js file and push your js file yeah
so the idea here is that you want to have like each time you do a code wars
put it into a js file and then push that
to github so you get those green squares when recruiters look at your at your
group at your github profile and they see those green squares boom good to go

02:37
awesome today i really felt like a software engineer hey i'd love to hear it
i know a lot of folks are from the ketchup crew so this might still be a
little bit new don't worry spend more time on the analysis than you do
on trying to solve next one all right return a new array
sorry return a new array consisting of elements which are
multiples of their own index in an input array all right so what
we're going to have here is we're going to have an array of numbers
and what we want to figure out is if that number is a multiple of its
index so let's take a look at that let's try to break down what it's being asked
and then we'll kind of read into the rest of the problem here so in this example

02:38
we have 22 negative 6 32 82 9 and 25. if we put the indexes under them right
why'd i do that boom there we go uh if we put the indexes under them we
would have 0 1 2 3 4 and 5. so now we want to figure out is are these indexes
able to divide evenly into the number right so like can these numbers go in
well we can't divide by zero so we're just gonna we're gonna we're that's
that's a no can one go into six yeah one can go into six that's a good one

02:39
can two go into 32 yeah so that's a good one and 3 go into 82
not evenly no so it's not a multiple right 3 is not a multiple of 82 because
it can't go in evenly that that's not a good one can four go into nine nah
can't go not evenly so it's not a multiple and can five go into 25
uh yes it can and it can evenly so that's a good one
whenever you're trying to solve these challenges
now with that attitude uh you have to like play with the values they give us
there's a reason why code wars gives you these test cases
even if i have no idea how to solve it i
still play with the numbers and see if i
can figure out a pattern right let's see if i can figure out a pattern and a lot
of times just by walking through the test case i go oh that's what that meant
and that's how i figure out what to actually do so always play with the test
cases that they give you um because they can be a huge yeah exactly a huge hint

02:40
uh as to how to go about solving the problem by working through these test
cases i now kind of have a better idea oh when they say multiple they mean can
the number go into it evenly and so i know a way that i can check to see if
a number can be divisible evenly what can we use there what could we use
um to see if it's divisible evenly yeah modulus exactly
some of the instructions are vague exactly and that's why we do code wars
so much is that we get used to these vague instructions these these things
that are kind of weird right and we get more and more comfortable with that
terminology don't feel bad if the terminology doesn't make sense until you
put in that work with code words that's why we do it cool um
cool so we did that we know that 1 goes in evenly two goes in evenly i goes in
evenly we only want those three values so since i only want those three values

02:41
right this is what those three values what what methods could i use here to just
give me those three values yeah this is like a good candidate for
filter for me i think a filter is really good here and so all i'm going to do
is filter out the values where the index
can divide evenly into the element right like 1 divides evenly into 6
2 divides evenly into 32 5 divides evenly into 25 so i'm just going to
filter out the elements where the index uh can go into evenly
and so the cool thing about filter is it's going to make this it's going to
make this problem pretty simple if you know what filter gives you so let's go
ahead and create a function here is i'm going to call like is multiple right
and we're going to pass in an array and we're just going to return

02:42
our array.filter now when filter runs what does filter grab as it runs excuse me
it grabs the element the index and the array
all right the element the index and the array but if i want the element the
index and the array i need what for the element the index in the array i need
what for the index sorry the element the index and the array what do i need if
i'm going to grab the element the index and the array
i need those parameters exactly so i can just go here i only i don't
need the array i just need the element in the index so i'm just going to do e
and i e for element i for index if i wanted to i could also grab the array
but i don't really need it for this example so i'm going to grab the element
and the index and then i am going to just do my

02:43
modulus math that we should feel a bit comfortable with now
so i'm going to do e mod i and if that's equal to 0 then i know
that i went into e evenly right thanks pierce
i i'm looking for i to go into e evenly so let's let's run these numbers and see
how this works so the very first time this runs let's say we're using this
array here the very first time this runs what is e chat what is e yeah
e would be 22 and i would be what would i be yep it would be zero
and so this does not pass our check uh zero does not divide evenly into

02:44
twenty two uh we we run into some issues with the dividing by zero right
and so we are going to it doesn't pass the vibe check uh so
this does not get included in the filter it's just not included
right it's just not included cool let's look at the next one the next
time this runs e is negative six right so e would be negative six and i would be
one because that's the index the negative six and one one
divides evenly into negative six so that's going to be included in the filter
right that'll be included in the filter that element will be included in the
filter now remember filter returns a what what is filter return
what is filter return it returns an array just like map returns an array

02:45
filter returns an array so if you pass the filter you get added to this new
array so this new array that we're creating now has the negative 6 in it
great the next time this runs we're going to grab 32
and it's index of 0 1 2. so 32 and 2 we know that 2 divides evenly into 32 so
that means that 32 passes this filter check
and goes into the new array that we're creating then we have 82 and
it's index of three three does not go into 82 so it doesn't pass right right
doesn't pass this check and so it doesn't get added to new array
then we have nine and four four does not go into nine evenly so it
does not pass this check nothing gets added to the array and then the very

02:46
last one we have is 25 and five five goes into 25 evenly so it passes this check
right passes this check and then 25 is added to this array what we would
wind up returning right what we wind up returning is this array this array
would get returned cool could we have used map instead sure you could have
um but i think filter is a little bit more applicable here because we are
trying to filter out values right we are trying to filter out values
you're going to find you can really kind
of overlap a lot of these methods if you wanted to but it's kind of like a
semantic argument right we are literally filtering out stuff so we should

02:47
probably use filter cool now remember we we had homework
on all these methods if you're if you're a little little lost here make sure you
go back to those array methods homeworks that are in the following materials and
then this is practicing code wars and like i said i don't think all these had
to click tonight i think maybe some of these you might have been able to get
but it's about being exposed to them understanding what's going on spending
some time on the analysis so you can start to kind of digest it and the array
cardio yeah that was pretty helpful too cool all right last one here
given an array of integers as strings and numbers
return the sum of all the array values as if they were all numbers return your
answer as a number so i know i'm getting a sum of a bunch of numbers

02:48
right i'm getting a sum of a bunch of numbers what method should be
going off in your brain when you see a sum of numbers from an array
yeah reduce exactly reduce should be you should be seeing reduce reduce reduce
reduce reduce reduce alright so let's go and try this
so we're gonna go and create a function here and we're gonna call this um
some of array values uh yeah let's just call it sum of values
well we know we're taking in an array and we are going to return it so we're
going to return the reduction of our array oops sorry reduction of our
array we know that our reduction always has right our reduction always has an

02:49
accumulator and a current value we know that we're adding to the
accumulator because it's asking for a sum return the sum so i immediately just
know this is just something i'm not even thinking right here i'm just saying all
right accumulator plus right not even thinking just adding to the accumulator
and we're going to turn the sum of all array values as if they were all numbers
so that means we're probably going to have some values that are not numbers so
let's go ahead and call this real quick and then we'll finish it
sum of values and let's pass in an array we'll pass in like five three two
and one right so let's save this let's just add the
current value to the accumulator and let's see what we have working let's
just see let's just see what happens right i'm going to comment out this one
up here just so we don't see that run and i'm gonna comment this one out here

02:50
so we don't see that run let's just have a simple reduce here
and let's see what happens uh ideally we know that five plus three
is eight plus two is ten plus one is eleven so we should see 11
right let's just see what happens what i call it sum of values
oh i didn't finish my reduction reduce forgot my uh my parentheses
all right let's save it let's go back let's refresh all right unexpected token

02:51
line 27 let's see what we got what am i missing folks oh i didn't console log it
oh and i added an extra when i didn't need it there we go
all right there we go let's save this let's console log it fourth try
all right so in the console we see 5 321 when it should have been 11. all right
so what's happening here yeah we're getting that concatenation in the house
concatenation is happening so what do we want to do with current value what are
we going to make sure that that is what do you want to make that it would
make sure that that that is a what the number so let's go ahead and use the
number method here all right so now all of our values will

02:52
be treated as numbers let's go ahead and save this let's go ahead and refresh
what hold on wait a minute all of our values are numbers now why am
i still getting the concatenating happening um yeah the start value
since this is still starting with a string
what is it setting the accumulator to to start with
what does the accumulator starting with starting as a string
so our accumulator is starting as a string so we need that that savior
that is the zero so now we will ignore that this is
string five the accumulator will start off as a number and um should be good
there we go now we got our lovely eleven seven try cool

02:53
so we got to remember that that zero can really save your butt down the line um
should we go like should we go like full code wars brain
so we should be we should never go full cold wars should we go full cold wars

02:54
all right let's let's go full cold wars it's just r all right there we go
okay i think we just went full code wars here folks let's see let's see if this
uh this works oh i didn't i didn't change it uh let's change it to s
boom we got our 11. full code wars [Laughter] oh boy
when you spend a half an hour sorry when you spend 20 minutes trying to solve
something your solution is like 40 lines long and then you open up the code wars
and it's this and you're like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
look at like you look at you you're like you look at like your 40 lines and

02:55
you're like and you look at their like one line and they look back at you like
every time that's every single time on code warriors
to this day this happens to me every single time
all right let's talk about what happened here never go full code wars
i think i think what we have here is still pretty readable i like it um so
what do we have here all right we have a lovely function expression
uh we're using our arrow syntax right leo are you gonna teach us regex
hell no don't use regex if you don't use regex to solve codewords unless you
absolutely have to even if the number one solution uses
regex don't use it because you're not going to use that like in an interview
um knowing the basics might be helpful but you should be learning how to solve
stuff not learning how to write regex redrx is like a like a way of dealing
with strings and a bunch of other weird stuff

02:56
um yeah but for code wars fight the urge to use regex and solve them
uh naturally all right so let's see what we got here we we named our function s
and we have our arrow function where we're taking in an array
so the r is holding our array we are reducing the array and whatever
happens to this reduction is returned because we have a what chat
what do we have it what do we have when we're using an arrow function
yeah it has an implicit return so we don't need the return keyword whatever
this reduce reduces down into like it's going to reduce down into
an individual value that value will be returned implicitly we don't have to say
return there inside of our reduction we have our

02:57
accumulator and our current value and then we got some javascripty stuff here
um this syntax the plus in front of the variable does what
what does that plus in front of our variables do you're an area operator hey
yeah it's the same thing as same thing as wrapping it in number
right it makes it a number right and so here i'm setting the accumulator to be a
number and then here i'm setting the current value to be a number and
unlike everywhere else in javascript the thing that really grinds my gears is
that this won't work because for this very specific time and moment in
this very specific moment in time space actually matters in javascript so
you got to have that space there right yeah and so we have a wonderful

02:58
