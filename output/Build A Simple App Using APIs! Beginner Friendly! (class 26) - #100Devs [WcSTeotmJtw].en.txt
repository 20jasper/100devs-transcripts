favorite part of the best week ever that's today's question what was your
favorite part of the best week ever we had a lot of stuff folks
there's a lot of things that happened we uh we had uh
not one but two new members of the stream team hello it's rufio meinwolf
joining the stream team we had uh nick's a wonderful talk the
first friday with friends session we had a sponsored stream by microsoft
this is kind of wild just saying this all out loud

00:03
we held our place down on our place throughout the four days
that's a lot it's a lot i've seen a lot of our places i love it
i love it i feel like our place was the winner that's where we came together as
a community to to to to fight off the void oh glad you're all here hope you had
some fun during the best week ever we're not done yet we got a few more raffles
to do today uh we have some other fun things to do new merch so
a lot of fun stuff to get to this evening tonight should be
trying to get this because we kind of we kind of lost some time in the beginning
so we'll try and recover some of that time and
if everything goes well we'll be able to get through our objects just some light
review some things we've already seen before
and then jump into these apis uh tonight we're going to play with three apis the
dog ceo api that we started with last class and that mine wolf was using on

00:04
their stream get some of that recall in get some of
that practice in then we're gonna be using a cocktail database api uh to get
some drinks and some cool stuff going on
the screen and then if we have some time
left over we'll play around a little bit
with the nasa's apis and will set up the homework for your weekend which is to
start building some cool stuff with actual apis this is where it starts to
get real fun for me folks i think this is where you have enough skills to be
dangerous you can start getting data from other other places and starting to
use to combine that to build really neat stuff so i'm hoping after tonight's
class you feel like you're you're ready to start messing around with some apis
start pulling some data from some other places start combining it in ways to
build the things that you want to build so super excited let's get into this
let's wrap up this best week ever with a banger folks don't worry we got some we
got some lovely raffles to get through we got some other fun stuff to get to uh
but let's jump into it uh if you haven't gone ahead and check

00:05
in please go ahead and check in for us uh exclamation point check-in does
nothing it just gives you the link you have to go to twitter and do the liking
and the retweeting i always appreciate when you do that it helps more folks
find our lovely lovely community and uh since since we we weren't actually live
for a little while i think we need some folks to realize that we're actually
back online and live so i appreciate it uh for uh for doing the look at the
likes and the retweets it always helps all right
remember we had some some some breathing
room this month some breathing room this month no networking until may
client deadline got pushed to may 3rd so if you are kind of been struggling to
get that client you got a little bit more time to get it uh and we're
chilling the networking just for a month to give us some time to focus on
building right tonight your homework is to build to build some real projects
with some real data with some real apis and so you need a little bit of time uh

00:06
to to to be able to focus on those things cool we also had this idea of client
alternatives right so if for some reason you're not able to uh seek out a paid
client there are two things that we could do instead
i'm talking to my first real potential client didn't think it would get one hey
congrats kismet got my deposit congrats that's huge
yeah i think that my client's so excited
hey that's what i'd love to hear yeah uh it's been really cool to see on the
celebration channel if you're getting clients come on
now if you're getting clients posting the celebrations channel come on now folks
you gotta you gotta celebrate the wins so many folks are getting clients and i
see it on twitter i'm like what are you doing getting the celebrations channel i
want to hear that you won we need that place to be lit so when you get a client
posting celebrations channel please louise

00:07
got a paid client and i just did one for charity nice
fine alternatives uh you can remember you can volunteer for a grassroots org
so if for some reason you're not able to get a paid client some folks have visa
issues things like that you volunteer for a grassroots
organization but you still do the full process you still have a client
you still you still have a contract you still have a proposal
i just got my first seven thousand dollar client what that's wild congrats
that's huge political season is upon us yeah that's
true a lot of grassroots orgs are gonna be uh kind of uh turning up the steam
and so great time to find one of those orgs to work with
you can also contribute to free software open source software shrimp fest
1500 client that's wild all right if you got a client
put that you got a client in chat and if

00:08
you're feeling real spicy put the amount if you got a client to say client
and if you feel spicy put it 25k client get out of here that's wild two clients
200 got a client got a client got a client got a client got a client got a
client seven hundred a thousand five hundred holy smokes look at this folks what

00:09
hold on what bruh what we don't get got we go get holy smokes what wow wow wow
wow that's huge that's huge wow super proud of all y'all i didn't think
uh we'd get that many that quickly that's pretty wild
wow you broke me for a second damn we out here we online folks i don't know

00:10
what else to say damn look at us go let's go damn
all right well i gotta stop myself from crying for a second we're doing good all
right no water works yet that's wild folks congratulations
everyone that got the client and congratulations everybody's still
pushing still trying to get the job done that's wild all righty folks
well a lot of you don't need the alternatives but they're here
volunteer for a grassroots org or contribute to free software uh
because we we talked about this on on on tuesday the idea that a lot of stuff
can be assuaged or or smoothed over when you
have a paid client and that's why it's so important why it's so important
cool that's wild congrats everyone uh also youtube we're up we're we're we are
we are kind of almost caught up the git and github clash just went up on

00:11
youtube today uh you'll see tuesday's class i'm going to edit it i'm
going to edit it as much as i can and i'll probably make it unlisted so
tuesday's class will get edited and probably be unlisted if i can remove the
names i will do it so i'm not making a promise yet but i'm going to try and get
it a lot of folks have asked for it um but if i can edit it in a way that i
think makes it look good we'll make it unlisted video otherwise we are caught
up on youtube so people are also posting they got jobs
already this is this is just wild give me a moment folks damn
cool other than that youtube should be
caught up this you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it
this is i said what was my favorite part of the best week ever it's just right
now it was this right now is the part the best part of the best week ever
so many of you got clients already that's real money what

00:12
ted talks too hey thank you for the gifted subs thank you for being here
and amy loose smiles hey thank you for the hydration cheers to you
this really is the best week exactly indifferent this really is
the best week ever holy smokes all right folks youtube's caught up
uh i try to post as soon as i can remember we always have a delay because
twitch uh part of our partnership agreements we can't post right away so i
know a lot of folks do like to catch up on youtube uh it's i don't monetize the
youtube so there's no ads there so if you've been like watching the vods here
on twitch you're probably gonna have a way better experience on youtube uh just
because it there's no ads so if you're if you feel like you need to catch up
with some of the videos probably use youtube instead of the instead of the
vods and uh yeah leon being stunned that his method works

00:13
i know it works but it's also a whole different thing to see like
a hundred plus people show out that they've gotten paid
clients in like one and go that's that's pretty wild
also a lot of you don't actually type in chat [Laughter]
coming after you uh so i know there's even way way more uh so that that's
pretty funny cool best week ever all right
merch so many folks wanted merch so we got some merch options it's not open yet
yeah you you're wild folks uh it's not open yet uh so many folks went at merch
i gave you a couple days heads up um and so there's a couple big pieces
that'll go back up it's not live yet there's a couple big pieces that'll go live

00:14
and let's see boom there we go does the verge go down already
i think it went down already oh boy i don't know if i can even show
it it won't even let me show it all right so there's a couple things
i'll i'll explain i'll draw it for you i'll draw you what maybe i can show you
this page i don't think there's anything here um
i'll do i guess i can take screenshots on my end let's see boom

00:15
all right so it was the same as last time we had the og 100 dev software
engineering shirt and in both kind of the kind of like normal cut and then
kind of a like the more rounded cut and then we had three new items
that were in limited stock and i literally don't think it can like
load fast enough it was wild so i'll pull it up here
here were the the other ones that are not loading for some reason we had uh
we had a very very very exclusive 100 dev shirt just to see how the print worked
we had the r place the r place lovely pixel t-shirt
and then uh stickers as well because i wanted to be like a way cheaper option

00:16
as well for folks that wanted it so if it all sells out we'll do another run
um but i always want to do like limited stuff whenever we do launch it uh but
yeah it looks like merch went down real quick i literally opened it while i was
talking okay here we go here we go oh cool cool we're good we're good we're
good all right so merge should be up now uh you could see
uh the stuff that's that's still here super limited quantities
and uh there's the lovely limited edition stickers from our time in our place
uh we have our lumen edition our place t-shirt uh the 100 devs in this is sour
stands pro which is my favorite font plus the 100 folks asked for it uh it's
a little bit of an inside joke they always use source sans pro for
everything if you know you know the og search for folks that wanted them
and then we have the lovely only fans match fanny pack uh everything here is
at cost there's literally no profit on any of this stuff as cheap as they will
let me sell it is what i sell it to you all there's no profit you made on any of

00:17
this stuff except for the fanny pack because i find it hilarious to charge
full price for it so all these all of these are um
like no profit on them at all and then the fanny pack is this the max they
would let me sell it for i sell it for max because it gives you the only fan
match and i can't sell my body for that for that cheap cool
alrighty so that that's more folks asked for it if it sells out we'll do another
run and maybe a month or so maybe it'll be like a monthly thing
but i really folks a lot of folks asked for the
the our place so i made the stickers and the t-shirt because i think that was a
really fun experience so merch is up i can hear the the things coming in
and so we're gonna we're probably gonna chill those sounds there we go

00:18
and one of these days we're going to do our own merch and so
there is the shipping is more than a sticker sorry i don't know how much
shipping is on the sticker we will in the future do our own merch
where i'll take stock ahead of time because i want way bigger sizes and some
smaller sizes as well uh so this is kind of like the testing ground to see what
works and then uh we will continue from there so
everyone asks for it you got it merch is in here i'll let you all kind of
panic through that and then like i said maybe like a every other month thing
we'll do more merch some limited edition stuff and some of the og stuff
the hoodies were all out uh the hoodies were all out and so like
the hoodie the quality that we really liked they did not have them like in stock
right now and so we'll bring the hoodies back hopefully like the next merch drop

00:19
because i know a lot of people want them it's just that the quality one that we
really liked um they didn't they they just didn't have them right now so
uh next time they're back in stock we'll do another one yeah
yeah master shout out to octo shrimpy who designed the r place version yep so
the the the the logo for the the that we actually placed in our place
was done by octo shrimpy thank you for pasting that uh and that's the the
design we actually put in our place so octo shrimpy uh i got a shirt coming
your way so after shrimpy we got one coming your way
just uh send me a mod mail please cool all right yeah i think a lot of folks
are going to get caught at the payment stage because some of this stuff was

00:20
limited quantities alrighty uh this is the best week ever
but it's the best week ever because uh uh quite a few folks has helped us get
here along the way i really want to do something bigger
but there are some thank yous i would like to say today
uh this best week ever has honestly been the best week ever seeing everyone come
through to to to come support the new members of the stream team to come to
our first friday with friends in huge numbers we we literally locked down
the top of the software and game development category like we just lock it down
polo rufio had number one on the science and game dev
uh category the entire time mayan wolf number one on the science
and sorry software and game development category the whole time we lock it down
right we had 700 plus people come to our first friday with friends this is wild

00:21
this community is a massive and it's amazing and i think it needs to be said
that it doesn't happen this way like an accident right it's the hard work of
everyone that's here it's the hard work of all the folks that show up time and
time again that come to class that type in class that show up on discord uh it's
it's it's because of y'all and behind the scenes there are a lot of folks that
actually helped make this run really smoothly so i want to take a second to
say some thank yous and then i want to start maybe like
highlighting a person every week because i just don't think folks realize
that it's not just me that there's a lot of folks behind the scenes making this
all happen so i want to thank the mods real quick so blah cat and motion i'm
going to use like your discord name because i don't know if you know if you
want to use the other names so blah cat emotion div ker and different ghost
jennifer chris miriam and kieran thank you i call him

00:22
memphis thank you so much to all the mods i don't think you realize
how much stuff they do on a day-to-day basis uh answering questions all
throughout discord filtering out weird messages making sure the community is
upholding to a great community to be a part of making sure our rules get
enforced it doesn't run well without our lovely
lovely mods so thank you thank you thank you um
each one of these mods has something that makes them amazing and makes them
uh make this kind of go smoothly so i'm going to take a
second just to say an individual thing for each one and then i will i will like
i said do something bigger as we kind of go go throughout the weeks
uh blah right off the rip any of the big improvements you've seen
on discord or part of the community has been their hard work if you're in a

00:23
study community it's because of their hard work if you [Laughter]
if you are seeing any of the newer stuff we're doing to try and bring people
together that's all blah that's not me that's blah so uh
blah has an amazing ability to uh work not only with the folks going through
the cohort but our alumni bring people together build community and then
they're also creating content too like what so thank you blah cat emotion
shows up when we need them the most uh is always there to kind of lift folks
spirits and some of the channels that we have that are newer and um always
appreciate their their help uh here here on uh twitch as well uh one time
actually putting it into putting it into only mode giving me a small
small heart attack as i didn't realize what was happening and bringing it back
uh but really do one of the most positive people i've ever interacted with that

00:24
brings joy to this community in untold ways uh in different ghosts
like come on now so many folks are getting jobs because
of the help indifferent has given folks the the the attention the the
the helping look at code the being a sounding board for so many questions
every time i go into the askleon channel and different is there going going to
go into battle and answering so many questions for the community and so
i i would be swamped swamped uh without indifference hard
work so thank you different ghosts occ is the most articulate person i have ever
come across they they we will have somebody that will send a mod mail where i am
absolutely stumped on how i'm going to respond to this person and then i like
refresh and occ jennifer uh has written out a beautiful

00:25
reply that like makes the person seen and heard and
answers their question in a way that i just probably wouldn't be able to do
chris is in a similar vein in the channels where the questions are
the hardest chris is in there making sure that they're pulling in
resources making sure people have a good direction and
i would not be able to answer the amount of questions i answer without chris
jumping in there and and pulling everything together specifically in the
ass leon channel difker divker makes the server run uh
i i don't i don't think i don't think folks see this a lot
but the server runs because of difficult uh all these little things that would
slip by my mind they see they bring up and they they help us work to fix it
they're always answering questions they keep a pulse on everything i actually

00:26
don't know how they are in so many channels
but difficult is able to cut just like the just the overseer
and whenever something's going down they're the first to see it they bring
it to our mod chat we're able to handle it so so many things that would have
been distractions to the community so many things that would have been things
that we don't just want here that we want to fix and solve has come because
of their hard work miriam uh is is is someone that brings a
lot of joy to twitch they're the person i see the most on twitch out of anyone
else just kind of answering questions being here and then showing up in a
different time zone which leads us also i'm going to call them memphis i've
always called them memphis kieran memphis [Music] we're a global community
and the bulk of our folks uh that that are on the mod team are are

00:27
not in a different time zone but miriam and memphis are and they show up
and when memphis shows up it's always the most warm kind
response that you could ever possibly think of always saying hello making sure
that folks feel welcome and so i i just the the community would not have been
shaped the way it was shaped without memphis showing up to um
to to be welcome and kind to folks especially when everyone else is asleep
there's some other folks too that i want to mention just quickly uh telescope
scenes they're technically a mod but they lead our project team and um
they actually help us build some really beautiful things that we're going to
hopefully bring to y'all very soon so i went to throw it out there and then we
we have uh two two other mods that were are og's that i just wanted i just wanna
throw it out there alyssa o'kayla they held it down for the longest time for us

00:28
and um like i said there's so many folks that i want to thank there's so many
folks that make this community run and and be able to do the things that we do
so this is just the start i really do want to give praise to a lot more folks
to the stream team the folks that put themselves out there for others to to
benefit others for everyone that shows up all the folks that are that are
mentors and helpers on the channel thank you thank
you thank you thank you um but i i needed to end the best week ever
by throwing at least some of those praises out because this community is an
amazing community it's helped so many folks learn how to code it's helped so
many folks get jobs it's how so many people get clients that we just saw
today like my mind is blown and it doesn't happen without it being intentional
without it not being an accident and so these folks give up their nights their
weekends their days to make sure that this continues to go on so i want to say

00:29
a huge thank you to everyone and then also a huge thank you to you
we're a big community now a big community thousands of people our
discord is almost at 3 000 30 000 people that's huge when i look at the
reach that 100 devs has on twitter we're seeing over a million in organic reach
that's a million eyeballs that are seeing the stuff that you are working on
that blows my mind and so are we outside we outside but we online too
we online right and so thank you to everyone that takes some time to help others
that takes some time to improve the community to make it better than when
you joined that doesn't go unnoticed and so thank you thank you thank you
cool all right we got that out the system i i like i said i want to be able to
highlight some more folks as we go throughout the weeks but we couldn't we

00:30
couldn't get through the best week ever without saying those things alrighty
tonight we're going through objects we are going through apis
we're going to have some fun we're going
to build some things we're going to do a little bit of reviewing and then we're
going to go deep playing with the api so
we feel comfortable so that for homework we can build some apps with these apis
already uh people are oh yeah this is actually
something that i wanted there's actually something to bring up because we got
through the good stuff people are starting to talk about people
not showing up for coffee chats i don't think it's 100 devs i really don't
i think the folks that are here that are showing up
that are part of this community wouldn't do that to people

00:31
but when your hashtag has a million people that see it in seven days
a million people that see it in seven days i don't i don't think it's us
i really don't i think that if you're on twitter
and you're using the hundred devs hashtag you gotta realize that there's a
million people that just saw that hashtag in seven days [Laughter]
so i i don't know what to say more on that i think the real community is
honestly on discord i love i i think twitter has its place
but uh come to discord that's where most people hang out
you don't have to worry about the riff raff that are out there
and uh if you are a person that's scheduling coffee chats please show the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up or just let the person know that
you're not going to show up but i think we've talked about this enough to where
i honestly don't think anyone that is here would actually do that anymore and
so um yeah that's what happens when you you're on

00:32
an open platform people use the hundred devs hashtag as though they're using
some other hashtag like 100 days of code it's okay um just know that it's not
just us anymore we're big we outside we online what can i say
bring them the discord if you see folks that want to be helpful
you see folks that that want to support the community bring them to discord but
that's where they're going to interact with the most folks that's where they
can be the most help in our help channels um yeah might not just be twitter
[Laughter] yeah we had a million eyeballs on that
hashtag in seven days a million in seven days that's wild that's so wild
but uh so with all the good that that comes with that so many folks coming and
joining our community joining our discord
our discord has grown by ten thousand in what like a month and a half like

00:33
yeah come on now you got we got to take the good with the
bad and so i definitely feel bad for folks that that open up public calendars
on the internet for random people to sign up but kinda hard change the number
maybe maybe that's how we really end alrighty
so tonight let's start with a little bit
of review and then once we get through a little bit of review we'll take our top
of the hour break alrighty programming chat what's a program
it's a set of instructions exactly it's a set of instructions that we write to

00:34
tell a computer what to do and therefore the act of programming is
writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand
the language that we write that the computer can eventually understand
is javascript and we're starting to get into the we're starting to get into the
groove with javascript folks we're starting to see some of the uh the the
realness of it we're starting to see we're moving from just patterns to maybe
understanding what's happening when we look at our code when we used to see
like document.queryselector.value we didn't know that value was a property
and query selector could be a method and document was an object right but now
but now we can start to to see what's happening underneath the hood a little
bit as we start to go deeper and part of
that is getting comfortable with objects and we need to get comfortable with
objects because one of the main paradigms we're going to use going

00:35
forward to help us bring structure and organization to our code is something
called object oriented programming right object oriented programming
and so to get there we have to feel really comfortable with objects and so
we're going to have quite a few quite a few classes on
getting through apis because with apis we can play with our objects and then
once we're feeling really comfortable we'll introduce object-oriented
programming we'll get comfortable with this like really important coding
paradigm and then we'll move on to the back end
uh we do have to do something important thank you for uh mentioning it in in
chat we haven't done the uh the newsletter raffle yet the newsletter raffle yet
and so i'm just going to go ahead and grab all these twitch names
slot remember folks it pays to open the newsletter

00:36
pays open news if you're not on the newsletter exclamation point newsletter
follow that link sign up for the newsletter
so many folks have won t-shirts and and amazing raffles from the newsletter
so for those that opened up the newsletter and filled out the secret
form that was in the newsletter today this one's for you
i see folks trying to fill it out now you know what you're in here if you
filled it out right now you're good still all right so
let me pull this name picker here all right we had 1500 people that entered it
uh when i met before i mentioned it fifteen other people that meant that and
entered before i mentioned it remember it pays to open the newsletter folks
sometimes there's a secret there's a secret raffle in there sometimes they're

00:37
not i don't know you gotta open it you gotta see also all the goods come in the
newsletter first so many raffle bots in chat nah they're
not raffle bots they're just really eager people [Laughter]
alrighty paddy d9 paddy d9 congrats on your t-shirt i will send you a
whisper here on twitch uh everyone that won raffles up until today
you should have received a whisper from me on twitch uh and for folks that had
even older ones that were mod males you should receive the message from me
already if for whatever reason you won something and you have not heard
from me send a mod mail please but you should have heard from me already uh

00:38
petty d i'll get to you uh after stream cool
awesome and like i said we got a couple other raffles today too folks
and uh we're gonna get to our top of the hour break in just a second so like i
said we're building up to this idea of using objects right of using objects and
what are objects we still got project letters and things
like that to announce as well yeah what are objects
everything exactly more specifically though we know that everything in
javascript really boils down to objects but what are they um
they are collections of variables and functions i like that
but they're collections of variables and functions
but when these variables and functions are tied to an object what do we call

00:39
them what do we call them yeah we call them properties and methods
so if you know what a variable is and you know what a method is
sorry if you know what a function is you know what a variable is you know what a
function is and you combine them into one thing you're dealing with objects
right an object have a bunch of variables a bunch of methods that are
tied to it but we call them properties and methods all right now
i like to think of objects when it comes to physical objects and so what i would
love for us to do is to take our break and then when we come back we're going
to think through some physical objects we're going to think through
how to build out a constructor again we're gonna see all the things that we
got into with objects beforehand we're gonna do that we're gonna take a break
we'll come back we'll start with our physical objects and then our goal is to
get to building a constructor together today and then moving on to apis

00:40
all right folks let's go ahead and bring up a five minute timer
remember don't dm me dm me won't get to me if you want something and you haven't
heard from me a mod mail please not dm mod mail
all righty folks put in five minutes on the timer here
alrighty if you're able to please get up move around

00:41
hydrate and i will see you in five come on now
well we added two minutes to the timer so let's uh when this gets to four i'll
change it to six and i'll run some ads as well [Music]
more our place shirts maybe we'll probably do another drop right all right
i'm gonna change this to six minutes then we're gonna run some ads and i'll
take my break as well boom all right folks see in six minutes two

00:43

00:44

00:45

00:47
minutes was add it to the timer and run some ads boom in a bit [Music] so

00:48
bob was on strike so simba unfortunately just had a procedure
and so he's like completely out of it he's home but he's completely out of it
and so i was just laying with him and i forgot to put bob up
he's doing all right yeah all right folks welcome back let's get into it
alrighty so we had two questions how do i submit the homework no homework to
submit tonight uh no no homework to submit tonight
oh scotty from strange parts raided and we were on a break get out of here
strange parts hey thank you for the raid hope you are doing well i hope your
stream went well hope you're feeling better too hey

00:49
no worries thank you for being here thanks for the raid welcome welcome
uh yeah we had a lot of folks that really enjoyed coming and hanging out
with you the other day and seeing you i hope you finished the the
the wood rack that you were working on but uh thanks for stopping by raiders
thanks for the raid hope your stream went well alrighty
see this is the best week ever so we're we're wrapping up the best week ever and
so come on now change prices hands down i'm gonna i'm gonna say one of like
definitely my favorite youtube channel [Laughter]
like heads down my favorite youtube channel uh i've i've watched all your
videos like way too many times so i appreciate you coming by thank you
for bringing the crew and uh hopefully we can stop by your way again soon
thanks for the raid all righty so we we had two questions
that i saw as i came back uh let me see actually let me put the

00:50
youtube channel in let's see let me pull it up real quick here we go
boom i'll put it in chat if you have it definitely subscribe
some of the best videos on youtube hands down cool alrighty
we had two questions that i noticed as we were coming back uh one was
one was homework uh nothing to submit for the homework you had to do it but i
don't need you to submit anything for it and going forward almost all of our
homework will be submitted on github so if you haven't watched the uh
the github course or the class that we did that was sponsored by microsoft make

00:51
sure you catch that video on youtube make sure you watch it that way you feel
a little bit more comfortable with git and github and then next week we're
going to walk through submitting the actual homework on git and github
yeah so the idea here is that you will eventually stop using like the google
forms and weird stuff like that and we'll submit all of our work on getting
using git and submitting it on github and so if you haven't caught up with
that class yet please make sure you do maybe re-watch it just so that you feel
more comfortable with it practice pushing up some stuff to github and then
we'll start using that to submit for class again cool the other question uh
the other question i saw is what are some practical uses of objects and so
we're going to see that today one of the beautiful things about
objects is that they're used all throughout javascript whenever you're
trying to build anything you're going to be using it in a series of a bunch of

00:52
objects right and so we're going to eventually get to a way of thinking
about anything that we're building that's going to be in an object-oriented
approach right so right now it doesn't have to be something that's like a a
wild connection that you have in your brain yet we're still kind of gathering
all of our tools and once we have all of our tools we're
going to use these tools to not only build stuff but to kind of think about
our code in a very specific way and so yeah it seems a little weird we're
building cars and tony hawk pro skaters and other weird stuff but eventually we
have all these tools and we understand the mechanics behind them then we can
kind of change how we build going forward so that's the goal and so
it really is just a collection of properties and methods of of of these
kind of functions and variables but whenever we're building anything we can
think about those things in terms of a collection of variables and functions so

00:53
whether it is a board game or a a even kind of like building out some of
the core functionality of our web applications it's all going to come down
to objects at the end of the day so give me a little little faith to get
there we need a little bit more tools in our tool belt i don't like jumping
straight to that because i think it's too hard to take it all in in one go but
we're building up to it we'll get there cool for now let's worry about like what
an individual object is right when an individual object is and that individual
object we can think by starting off of just a physical object and so
the object that we we've talked a lot about during class is just a stopwatch a
stopwatch is great because it does have a really strong collection of properties
and methods what are some properties of the stopwatch we have on screen

00:54
yeah color property uh a brand property a shape property
a material type property that's cool we haven't talked about that one before um
a weight property that'd be a cool one a model property
even like a minute seconds and and milliseconds property right
and so notice how we're all talking about the properties
and then all these properties have values so we have the
color property that would be the value of black
we have the shape property that would have the value of round we would have
the brand property that would have the value of accusplit we would have the
model property which would be the value of pro survivor we would have the
minutes property which would have the value of three so we have all these
properties and their associated values that make up this one object but this

00:55
object also has functions or methods actions that it can do what are the
methods that are tied to this very physical stopwatch object
yeah we can kind of see some of the big ones right there start and stop and
split and reset right all these things that the stopwatch can do
the actions it can take right so that start that stop the mode the split the
reset uh we can we can utilize all those things uh to
to to make our object be able to do stuff right and so whenever we're
thinking about any object it can be a stopwatch it can be a car
there are going to be properties and and methods that we can tie to it and
that's going to keep carrying on through our code as well
we're going to start to see these things today when we get to our apis our apis
are going to have these properties that we can use and start to build with them
and so we'll get more and more kind of usefulness out of this as time goes on

00:56
all right how have i created a stopwatch on this line right here
i created a stopwatch object using what type of notation here yeah
literal notation uh when we're we're literally creating
the object because we've used the curly braces directly
now i've added the very first property to my object here using what type of
notation yeah dot notation exactly so i've literally created an object on this
line and then i added a current time property that had the value of
and then i added a tell time property right a tell time property that
sorry not tell time property a telltime method how can i tell that this is a

00:57
method yeah it's assigned to a function so i can see that this is a property
because it's set equal to any other data structure that we've
learned and we can tell that this is a method because it's set to a function
beautiful and we see that this function is very simple it takes in a value and
then it will say the current time is that value
using a template literal and then down here
we are calling that telltime method and how can i tell that i am calling the
telltime method how can i tell that i'm calling this telltime method
yeah the parentheses exactly i can see that there are parentheses and i can see
that i'm passing in an argument that is using the current time property of the
stopwatch object so i'm literally passing in 12 here

00:58
right i'm literally passing in 12. all right passing in 12. and so
we can go ahead and say that this is kind of just the number 12 there because
stopwatch current time was 12. so we passed in 12
we passed it as a parameter and we wind up seeing the current time is 12 print
it to the console beautiful alrighty all right we had this let's code of
objects lost galaxy so let's go ahead and take a look at it real quick and
we we've created a dog object before let's go let's check what's it what's a
different object that we could create not not not a dog we've already created
a dog what's another object that we could create
pizza i like pizza pizza's a good one so let's change this to create a pizza

00:59
object that has four properties and three methods and i don't want you to use
a constructor wait is it just it's just coming through
the notification is just coming through strange parts thank you again for the
raid uh thank you for bringing your crew over
here uh thank you for all the content you put out i love it all right
so this is in the objects lost galaxy folder and if you need the materials maybe
you're new maybe you came here with a raid uh you can get all of our materials
on discord so if you do exclamation point discord you agree to our rules
there is a follow-along materials channel that has all the materials that
we're going to be using including our apis today so you definitely want the
materials if you're going to be hanging around for a little while longer so i'm
going to put just like like three minutes three minutes on the clock here
even if you've got this down pat really try and build this out go go for the win

01:00
here three minutes on the clock you got this
you're creating a pizza object that has four properties and three methods
yeah you gotta agree to the rules and then you'll see a follow-along materials
channel that has all the materials in it for today
yeah it said dog we already did dog does let's swap at the pizza this is review

01:01
all right folks two minutes and we're gonna go over it together don't worry
what does pizza do exactly oh i like that pizza toppings as an
array i think it's a cool idea i was charged a couple times yeah
they'll sort it out the stream labs handles it pretty well
i'm sure that eventually it'll it'll clear uh if not hit up stream labs
they're pretty good about supporting the folks

01:02
on my drink i'm drinking some some coffee today just some instant coffee
all right 45 seconds and we'll go over it together
instant sacrilege sometimes that's all that's all you got time for it's a long
day i drink coffee at this time of day i'm
up forever there's there's one beautiful thing about being bipolar and taking
medicine that knocks you out it doesn't matter what i do as long as i take my
meds i'm out the best part of adhd coffees has no
power at night so that is actually interesting
coffee ain't got nothing on seroquel exactly all right folks come on back

01:03
let's go over this together i always like the joke one of the the
very first time i got put on um i don't know i think it's not joke it's
just a story uh the very first time i got put on adh
medicaid adhd adhd medication i took it and i took the best nap of my life
like i took my adhd medication i was ready to like get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done
and i just took the the best nap i've ever had in my whole entire life and i
found that that's like a pretty common thing like if you get folks that have
certain types of attention issues they take the the adderall or whatever and it
just helps them like get good sleep so the complete opposite of what i was
expecting but it was it was good took a glorious nap your first day hey i
love to hear it vlog exactly yeah all right let's create this pizza object

01:04
so we're going to use literal notation to create it so we'll say let pizza
equal and then we have our curly braces beautiful
now what are some some so what are some properties
what are some properties that our pizza could have size toppings
and crust let's go and do pizza size equals large cool pizza dot toppings
equals and we can use it we can use an array here that's a really good
suggestion to use an array so i'm going to do spinach and i'm going to do um
onion and i'm going to do um jalapenos yeah we'll stop there

01:05
or banana peppers but not i could do banana peppers too can never spell banana
banana peppers there we go cool all right so we
got our size we got our toppings what's something else we could do
peppercinis no i can tell i can tell you're not domino's gang when you say
pepperchinis that's some papa john's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
crust we said crust exactly crust what type of crust do you all like
say thin crushed you're wrong stuffed hell yeah there you go stuffed crust
[Laughter] uh so that's four properties we need one
more property one more property uh sauce heavy sauce always heavy on the sauce

01:06
heavy on the sauce for sure cool oh we gotta add garlic too we
forgot garlic on the topic that's the best topping
there we go beautiful all right so we got our four properties and we need
three methods as somebody said excellently in chat what can pizza do
that's a good one made it delivery time it's part of the pizza i say console.log

01:07
calculating uh pizza dot [Laughter] burn mouth oh yeah buddy [Music]
there we go all right and what's the last one
let's see what's one more we can do frisbee [Music]
i have no idea i spell frisbee there we go frisbee equals
i'm just gonna say console log there we go nice
all right here we go we got our pizza with four properties three methods

01:08
they're looking beautiful we got a size topping crust and sauce property an
estimated delivery time burn mouth and frisbee function um
now if i wanted to create another pizza what would i have to do copy and paste
exactly if i want to make a whole other pizza okay um all right

01:09
all right so now we're pizza two pizza two and now we can change it up small
people got mad with the banana peppers or remove the banana peppers
a lot of people said thin crust i don't know where how your mama raised you but
thin crust i guess and then uh heavy people just like normal sauce
all right so so new york crust is not thin crust
right like new york style is not thin that is that correct like to me new york
is foldable but not thin i think thin is like something new that chain
like chain restaurants made up to like serve you less food
i love a good foldable slice but i think thin is different

01:10
all right so what all this all this humming and hauling was if i wanted to
create another object i would literally have to like copy and paste right did i
not copy and paste what there we go not only did i have to copy
and paste and change everything if i wanted to keep making more pizzas i
would keep copying and pasting over and over and over again right and each time
i copy and paste it i'm taking out more memory
and this code is not very what this code ain't what code ain't dry
we online we can't be right and dry we can't be writing wet code anymore we
online can be writing wet code it's just it's just not dry
so how can we solve this problem of wanting to create a lot of pizzas
like we like domino's comes through they're like leon pull up we need you to

01:11
make a bunch of pizzas what can we create that'll enable us to
make a bunch of pizzas a constructor exactly a constructor it's
a pizza machine right it's a constructor the constructor will enable us
to make as many pizzas as we would like and so we saw this idea of a constructor
already we tied us the idea of wanting to make a
bunch of cars coming out of a car factory but we could do the same thing for any
type of object whether you want to be a pizza or a car factory so
let's go ahead and keep that pizza machine in the back of our brain because
we're going to build a constructor that is for our pizza so let's keep that
pizza machine in the back of our brain when we get to building a constructor we
will use the pizza to build our constructor but let's look at the
constructor syntax first and then we'll build our constructor together so

01:12
here we have a constructor to make a car the idea is that i can
write my constructor once i can write my constructor once and then
i can make as many cars as i want eventually i'm going to make my own
constructor for my pizza that way i can make as many pizzas as i would like
now somebody asked like why like why well one
is that we don't have to keep rewriting code over and over again
but eventually we also get to unlock some secrets of javascript that
prototypal inheritance that we've talked
about in the past when you're using your constructors you get access to that we
get eventually access to things like the the prototype chain so we can write
exactly more modular code that we can write code that takes up less memory we
can take rate code that's more efficient but to get there we got to understand
what a constructor is and then eventually what the prototype is so

01:13
let's start with this idea of wanting to create a bunch of cars from this lovely
car constructor you can see here that i am creating a function
and that function starts with a capital letter what the heck does that capital
letter mean yeah it's a constructor it doesn't give it any special powers
or abilities it just says hey the the function that's about to follow is a
constructor when you use it with this new keyword you can get a what
when you use the constructor with the new keyword you can get a what
yeah you can get an object an instance of that object yeah you can get an object

01:14
you get a car you get a car you maybe if if if if 100 devs turns into a
million dollars maybe we're raffling cars and not t-shirts we can dream can't we
all right [Laughter] so here we have this idea that we're
going to create a new object from this make car constructor
right this make car constructor uh we could go ahead and um
we can create as many cars as we would want from this constructor but instead
of having to copy and paste all of these lines every single time we
wanted to create a new object we only have to do new and then call the
constructor new and call the constructor and so we can turn
making a hundred cars into a hundred lines instead of a hundred times this

01:15
many lines of code all right cool so when we go ahead and we use this
constructor notice that we've passed in four what what are what are these called
for what yeah we're passing in four arguments and
those arguments going to be placed into the parameters of the constructor so
honda finds its way into car make civic finds its way into car model
silver finds its way into car color and four
finds its way into number of doors so wherever i see car make
it's now actually honda wherever i see car model it is civic
wherever it is car color it is now silver
and wherever his number of doors is now for okay
also the object that's coming out of it right the object that's coming out of it
also gets this honk method the beep

01:16
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh it also gets this lock method
locked and the cool thing is whenever you see this dot doors what is this
referring to what is this referring to yeah the object itself so how many doors
would this object that we just created have if we ask for this doors how many
are we getting yeah we're getting four we passed in four
number of doors was four so this that doors is for remember this is referring
to the object itself cool now if we want to create a whole new car
well guess what we don't have to sit here and type all this crap out again we
can go ahead and just call the constructor again
don't forget our new keyword and we can pass in all these values again

01:17
out will come out of this car what will come out of this out of this constructor
will be a car that has the following properties it'll have a make property a
model property a color property a doors property and two methods hunk and lock
so let's go and take a look at this i'm going to grab this real quick and
i'm gonna put it in my terminal my console sorry and
now that constructor function is in memory
and i can go ahead and let's just grab the roadster line boom let's grab it
yoink there we go so now we have created a tesla roadster and if we ask for it
you can see that it has a color property of red a
doors property of two a honk method how can i tell that honk is a method here

01:18
how can i tell that hunk is a method here yeah i can see that it's like the
parentheses and if i open it like that f parentheses let me know that's a
function that's there same thing for lock is let me know there's a function
there so it's a method it's tied to an object we say there's a make property of
tesla and a model property of roadster i can even ask for these things i could
say like tesla roadster dot make and get tesla back
now there's one other really cool thing i can see what about this tesla roadster
when i asked for all the information that was stored in memory about this
tesla roadster was something that i noticed about where it came from what
can you see where it came from yeah we can see the constructor the
factory that it came out of and we can see that it's coming from the make car
factory right we can see that this is a an object that comes from the make car

01:19
factory any car that i create out of this constructor we will be able to see
that it comes from the make car constructor and since it comes all these
objects come from the make car constructor what's a cool thing that
they all share what do you what is any car that comes
out of this constructor share [Music] people will be watching the videos back
people will be doing the homework yeah they get grandma they get the
prototype right remember the object can always check itself for
properties and methods but if it does not have that property
method it can go up the prototype chain the inheritance chain to find those
properties and methods and once the object is done checking itself

01:20
where is the first place it looks to find those other properties and methods
where's the first place it goes yeah it goes to the the mama constructor
exactly it goes out to the constructor function it checks itself
then it checks the constructor function and eventually can go all the way up the
prototype chain until it gets to the what until it gets the what i need to make
that like i need to like oh that's a good project idea would it
be an amazing project like when i do this it does like the more you know across
the stream that's i can do that i can detect this hand i can detect my hand
using microsoft's cognitive apis uh they're a wonderful set of apis that
enable you to uh use machine learning at your fingertips

01:21
without having to be a machine learning practitioner
so maybe maybe that's something we'll work on
all right so yeah we would check the object itself right and then
uh we could check the object itself and then we could
look at the constructor's prototype see if there's anything there if not we keep
going up the chain and you hear me referencing grandma because that's kind
of how it really works let's say i didn't have a car
i could ask my mom for a car if she didn't have a car she could ask grandma
for a car and if grandma has the car well guess what i get to use those
properties and use that car it's the same thing with our objects when it
comes to javascript alrighty uh one of the things we've
noticed is that if we ask for our roadster like let's look if we go ahead and do

01:22
um tesla roadster i think it's still memory yup if we go and do like tesla
roadster dot uh bluetooth uh we can see that we get undefined we
can see that the tesla roadster does not have bluetooth and so what we can do is
we can actually update the make car prototype so make car prototype bluetooth
now i can do this and the next time i ask
for tesla roadster bluetooth i get true what did the tesla roadster check first
because now when i do tesla roadster.bluetooth
i'm getting true what did it check first it checked itself first
it did not have bluetooth so then it checked the prototype and since we just
gave the prototype true when we asked tesla roadster that
bluetooth it returned true it didn't have it
itself right it didn't have it itself so it went up to the prototype

01:23
i could do this though now where did it get true from itself i added bluetooth
to the object itself so when tesla roadster went and checked bluetooth
right did it have bluetooth yes it did that tesla roadster now had
its bluetooth so did it have to go up the prototype no it just stopped
let's create another car from the um from the mate car prototype let's go
ahead and say um it's a cool car i'm gonna give me a car

01:24
because i get streamer brain nsx frs tacoma
i saw a rivian for the first time it's pretty dope r34 gtr
prius there we go prius that's what i'm looking for
so we're going to go ahead and do uh toy yoda prius sometimes i just have fun
said apres equals new make car and we have to pass in the four properties
so the four properties we have to pass in are the make so this is uh toyota
you know what makes a prius cool people don't know what makes a prius cool
is that you can leave the ac on all night long so you can like if you're

01:25
going to live out of a car the prius is the one to do it
i was really into living in my van for a
while it's a story for another day but i always wish i had air conditioning
yeah you can leave ac running the whole night because it uses the battery not
gas and in the middle of night if the battery gets too low the car will kick
on just for a few minutes top off the batteries and then ac starts blowing
off the battery again toyota and then car model uh prius
and then we wanted to go ahead and say car color
and we're gonna go ahead and say gray and then we're going to go ahead and say
number of doors for cool so now if i ask for toyota prius
and i ask for bluetooth you can see i'm going to get true but
let's just get the object back first toyota prius let's look at it

01:26
does toyota prius itself have the bluetooth object
can we get 100 devs bumper sticker i have a i have a no bumper sticker policy
that's when you jump the shark as a community yeah there's there's no there's no
there's no bluetooth property on this prius wait a minute
if you look at tesla roadster it has a bluetooth property
why does the tesla roadster have a bluetooth property of true
but the new toyota prius we may not have it because you added it leon [Laughter]

01:27
because i did i added it i added it directly to the the tesla roadster
i used dot notation to add bluetooth to the tesla roadster
but we can see that doesn't change the constructor still any any car coming out
of this constructor no longer doesn't have that bluetooth property so when i do
toyota prius dot bluetooth where is it getting that bluetooth
property one more time yeah it's getting it from the
constructor's prototype the prius checked itself it did not have bluetooth
it went up to the prototype uh uh sorry i went out the prototype
chain to the to the make car constructor that make car
constructor did have the bluetooth property so toyota prius has that

01:28
property how about if we do this though doors dot to string all right
doors we know toyota prius does have a doors property
um and it was a property of four right and we wanted to go ahead and grab
we wanted to grab that number that door that was a number
right and turn it into a string did toyota prius have a tostring method
it doesn't matter if it was already a string or not stay with me no
twitter prius did not have a two-string method
did the make car constructors prototype have to string nah
so where the heck did it come from it went all the way up the prototype
chain exactly to the global object prototype grab two string off of there

01:29
and it was able to use it went all the way back down the prototype chain and
since the global object prototype the global object prototype since it had it
we were able to use it nice thanks grandma alrighty now
let's go ahead and code our constructor i want to open up we have a
a set of uh an object's constructor fun is the name of the folder
objects constructor fun is the name of the folder objects constructor fun
i want you to create a constructor that has four properties and three methods
right four properties the three methods and i want it to be our pizza

01:30
constructor so make a pizza constructor with four properties and three methods
we're gonna put three minutes on the clock
get as far as you can go and then we'll go over it together
larry phil this is class 26. join the discord join the ketchup crew
never too late all right folks three minutes on the clock you got this dig deep

01:31
we're building a constructor that has four properties and three methods
ziggy they are they're the go to follow materials channel they're there

01:32
did i label it wrong on discord [Music] see no it says 26. welcome nicki's
glad you found us got quite a few folks from colombia in the community
40 seconds left folks you got this as far as you can
are objects common in front of development yeah they're common front
end back end we're going to use them across our stack as we kind of continue on

01:33
yeah we'll see the class syntax in a few seconds i like it too
why is it called a stack stack is a pretty common term across
programming but also it just refers to all the things you need to get your job
done you have a bunch of these different
tools that you throw in a stack which is a data structure but
all right folks come on back come on back let's take a look at this together
alrighty so we wanted to create a constructor with four properties and three
lovely methods and so let's go ahead and create our constructor
and i was going to go ahead and say function and we're gonna call this a pizza
machine uh but what do i need to change about my function name here

01:34
what do i need to change about my function name here yeah it needs a capital p
remember that capital p doesn't really do anything it just lets us know right
it's just it's just between us see me and you that that's a constructor
all right cool and um we're going to have a couple
different properties let's look what our original properties were
we had size toppings crust and sauce remember that for me size toppings crust
and pasta size toppings crust and sauce all right there we go
so now i'm going to go ahead and set up all of the properties and what keyword
do i need to use so that the objects that come out of our pizza machine have
those properties what keyword do i need to use yeah this

01:35
this dot size i'm going to set it equal to size
and i think a lot of times when i do this people get kind of confused
this right here is creating the property on the object
like when we look at our objects and they have like the size
property and it has some value that comes from here
right this.size is giving the actual object the property of size however this
right here is just a what on the right hand side is just the what
just a parameter is this the parameter yeah we could call it we could call it
whatever the heck we want we could call it um rainbow
unicorn and it wouldn't matter we just have to call it rainbow unicorn here
it's just common practice that the this that's binding the property to the

01:36
object and the parameter are typically just the same and so we'll just always
kind of keep it the same but i want you to make sure that you know
that one is a parameter and one is actually binding that property to the object
cool so we'll do this dot size equals size and we'll do the same thing this dot
toppings equals toppings and then we'll do this dot cross equals crust
and this dot sauce equals sauce cool alrighty next we got to go ahead and we
got to add our methods so what were our methods that we had let's see

01:37
delivery time burn mouth and frisbee all right let's go ahead and create those
let's go ahead and create those so we'll go ahead and do our lovely this dot
estimate it the livery time and we'll set that equal to a function
and that function will be a console log and we'll just say calculating for now
calculating cool next one was burn mouth this dot burn mouth equals a function

01:38
and that function we'll just stay at console.log and we'll just put in there
there we go and then we have the last one this dot
can't believe i keep forgetting it frisbee
and let's go ahead and create this as a function as a console.log that is
there we go cool alrighty now let's go ahead and create a new pizza let pizza
equal and we can go ahead and what keyword do we need to create our first pizza
new and we can use our pizza machine we can pass in the size uh large

01:39
toppings we can pass in as an array i'm just gonna say spinach and a garlic
the go-to's as one might say and then we're gonna pass in crust which will go
deep dish dust time just to show chicago some love and then sauce
we're gonna go for sauce what are we feeling for sauce we're saying alfredo ugh
barbecue sounds kind of good though i'm gonna say white sauce
i don't know do you all have like white pizza where you come from that's like um
it's like a white sauce with like tomatoes and banana peppers on it

01:40
that's that was always the best pizza it's not alfredo though it's not alfredo
sauce that's something different this is this is like a really nice
you're from philly we have a place called celebrities they have the best
white pizza i've ever had in my life cool all right so we got a new pizza let's
save this and let's go ahead and open it in the browser and see how we're doing
so let's open it in the browser wrong browser
boop all right here we go let's open up the inspector
and we should be able to see a pizza cool great we can see that the pizza is an
object that was made from the pizza machine constructor we can see that it
has a burn malfunction a crust an estimated delivery time method a frisbee
method sorry mouth as a method sauce property of white a size property of

01:41
large and a toppings property that's an array look at this go look at us using
all of our different data structures look at this go all right
it's clicking all right so i like to hear seen a lot of that tonight oh it's
finally clicking hey let's go turn up congrats thank you for hanging out for
it to start clicking a little bit all right so we created our pizza
uh what if i wanted to we would what have we forgotten
on our constructor what what could we add to our constructor so that all of
our pizzas had something what could we do what what what is our constructor
missing cheese type oh big facts so let's go ahead and do pizza machine
dot prototype dot cheese or chess hanging up

01:42
excuse me how fancy you are and um let's go ahead and start by saying false
those be true or false that's what we'll do we'll say true or false cool
and so now if i ask for pizza dot chess you can see it's false so did pizza
itself have ches no it had to go up to the pizza machine
prototype to get that chess and see that it was false beautiful
um somebody asked during office hours and i thought it was a really good
question so i want to make sure we take a second to mention it while we're here
eventually not now this is too advanced for right now
but eventually we can use this prototype to our advantage right now
let's say i'm domino's how many pizzas do you think domino's makes a day

01:43
that's like a consulting interview how many pizzas does dominoes make a day
do you think y'all guess i'm wild all over here
thousands maybe a million i don't know i don't know let's let's just say there
let's let's just let's let's let's throw prices right rules out the
window and let's say a hundred thousand pizzas a day hundred thousand pizzas a
day and so if we were building a pizza machine
and we made a hundred thousand pizzas and we gave each one the frisbee method
how many google says 1.5 million pizzas a day all right all right
so let's say 1.5 million pizzas and every single pizza that comes out of
our constructor has that frisbee yeet method

01:44
how many methods do we have stored in memory if every pizza that came out the
constructor had a frisbee method how many frisbee methods would we have in
memory 1.5 million because every single object that we created
would have that method if we look if we look at pizza right now
we can see that it has its own frisbee method
that frisbee method's not coming from the prototype that's the method that's
on the frisbee that came out of that constructor
right it got it from the constructor but it's not sitting on the constructor the
object has that itself right the object has that itself that's
just the name of where it came from that's not actually the prototype that

01:45
pizza has its own frisbee method so if we made 1.5 million pizzas it's
not inheriting that we just made 1.5 million pizzas that all had their own
frisbee method which means we have 1.5 million frisbee methods in memory
what would have been a lot better for us to do if we knew we were going to make
millions of pizzas it would have made a lot of sense for us
to put it on the prototype right that way the the pieces that got made
weren't holding on to their own version they could all share one version and so
we just lost if we did that if we put it on the prototype we 1.5 million methods
come out of memory and we can just use one that's on the prototype
so eventually we can start using these objects to do stuff that makes our code
more efficient that makes our code work a little bit faster or use a little

01:46
less memory but like i said that's that's for that's for the future but i
know some folks were thinking about that
and it came out during office hours so i wanted to mention it again you know
why wouldn't you do that with every method maybe you do maybe we'll get
there maybe we will do that [Laughter] cool all right before we take our break
uh i want to show something real quick uh actually let's take our break when we
come back from our break we're going to look at quickly the class syntactical
sugar and then we're jumping into apis and we'll finish up class by playing
with our apis working through our apis when we come back from our break yeah
we'll do a raffle so let's take five minutes on the clock cool

01:47
go ahead and press play here i'll see you in five minutes if you're able
please get up move around hydrate this last hour of class is gonna be great
we're gonna have a lot of fun with the apis we're gonna get a raffle in but
please if you're able to get up move around and i'll see you in five

01:48
i'll bring back bob for you and that's what you want thank you noor [Music] so

01:49

01:50

01:51

01:52
[Music] so do uh [Music] all right folks come on back come on back all right so
we saw the traditional constructor and with the newest versions of es6 plus

01:53
when i say es6 plus what the heck do i mean yeah so there is a specification for
javascript kind of like the rules for how javascript should come
together kind of the the the the guidelines for how javascript should
come together and that's called ecmascript and those kind of versions or the
versions of this get updated every so often and so in 2015 there were pretty big
changes to the standard and so we call anything that happened from like 2015
forward es6 plus and what we mean is like all the big changes forward that
happened and so one of those big changes were they added some syntactical sugar
to stuff to make javascript a little bit more digestible for folks coming from
other languages right and so one of the things they did is what we
have on the screen here which is a class books coming from other object oriented

01:54
languages we're very used to having classes but prototypal inheritance is a
little bit different and so to make them feel comfortable
they gave them classes which kind of obstructed away the prototypal
inheritance it's still there it's still underneath the hood it's just a little
bit looks a little bit different so feels feel a little bit more comfortable
so going forward we won't write our constructors using like the older syntax
you'll see me using the class-based syntax to do it and there's really only
uh one real difference that you kind of see it break down into
two main sections the constructor area and then your actual methods so instead
of doing like this dot honk equals and then a function you give the name and
your parentheses and your curly braces like normal and that's the method so
this make car constructor has the constructor bit here just like
normal and then our methods follow after so it's very similar to the constructor

01:55
that we're used to just a little bit of sugar to make a little bit different
somebody said who makes the changes uh there are committees or like boards that
make changes to these languages whether it is html css or javascript and you can
actually like run for office for some of
them right um every so often people have
to be like voted on to the to the to the teams
and so it's a big deal like if you get really into this stuff that you want to
help push the specification forward and then like there are people that are like
in charge of saying like yes or no and they all vote kind of like a board for
javascript basically um so that's pretty cool all right let's do a raffle
it's not open yet let me go ahead and open it first um all righty not yet

01:56
all right not yet all right here we go you can do
exclamation point raffle to get in excretion point raffle again this is for
learn with leon swag let's do one a minute
here just to give everybody a fair shot exclamation point raffle to get in
you got this get in get in you two could be the lucky owner
the the the merch cell's out folks this might be the only way to get it [Music]
how are we doing with the store let's see if there's still anything in there
[Music] nope merch sold out folks merch sold out that's wild i love it

01:57
as you get your merch you gotta you gotta rep it
throw it in the discord showing us that you got it tweet me
alrighty folks come on back alrighty let's go ahead and pick the
winner i'm gonna close the entries here and i'm gonna pick the winner in three
two one jasmine hey congrats on the win jasmine hey congrats
on the win uh i will get a message your way here you're gonna whisper for me
here on twitch so keep an eye on your whispers and i'll reach out to you after
stream cool i'm gonna go ahead and complete this one
and make my little note over here cool well we're gonna do another raffle

01:58
before we do our raid this evening so still another chance to get a lovely
lovely 100 dev swag package cool all right apis what the heck are apis
chat what what the heck is an api we haven't announced the project
portfolio winners yet we haven't done that yet what are apis oh
a lot of things over here application programming interface app what's that mean
application programming interface what huh a simple interface

01:59
for some complex action simple interface or a complex action so i have
in front of me i can't unplug it i'll use the different
let's use let's use um my lovely uh pokemon pikachu 2
who's currently mad at me i have to shake jacob so he doesn't get mad
i have this lovely pokemon pikachu 2 and if i want it to turn this
off what could i do what's the most primal thing i could do to turn this off
i could smash it i could just throw it on the ground sometimes pikachu gets to
my nerves i could just smash it break it and it would turn off
maybe i could rip the battery out and it would turn off
but uh that's probably not what the makers of this want me to do

02:00
they probably want me to use the interface that they have given me
and press the right button to turn this on and off so
we could have done something extreme like smashed it or ripped the battery
out but the makers have kindly given me an interface
and that interface is the button to turn it on and off so
we can think of this turning on and off as a very complex action there's a lot
of stuff that has to happen for this to turn on right the button has to be
pressed power has to fill capacitors the the power has to leave the capacitor go
to the lcd screen that screen then needs to display the right pixels to see
pikachu in all of its glory that is a very complex action and turning it off
is the same thing we have to like power it down the power has to leave the

02:01
screen has to turn off all these things have to happen
for this to turn on and off and i don't have to know how any of that works
i don't have to know what's happening from the
power leaving the battery to powering the screen
i just press a button or i give it a shake and that's my interface to turn it on
right that's my interface i see a lot of people throwing out
abstraction you're right we're going to get there right and so for me
i like to think about this in a another way too i had a simple interface that
turned my pikachu on and off but i also like to think about a restaurant
a restaurant when i sit down the restaurant gives me a simple interface
that enables something complex to happen in the kitchen what is the simple
interface that a restaurant gives me that enables me to have something

02:02
complex happen in the kitchen yeah a restaurant can give me a menu
and i can select what i want off that menu that menu is my interface and when
i select something off that menu i can then have something complex happen
in the kitchen and so when i select my let's see what do i want pizza right
we'll be going with pizza when i select my pizza off the menu
i don't actually know what's happening in the kitchen i don't know how long
they're stretching the dough for i don't
know exactly what's in the sauce i don't know exactly what type of vegan cheese
they're using i don't know where the spinach came from right i don't know
description i don't know what's happening in the
kitchen i don't know if they're washing their hands exactly i don't know what's
happening in the kitchen all i know is i had a simple interface

02:03
something complex happened and then i have a delicious delicious pizza right
same thing is happening when we use right when we use the apis that we're
about to use but instead of it being a menu and the menu being an interface
the url that we have is our interface based on the url that we use
we are making a request for some complex action to happen on a server
that action happens and then the server responds with some information
so just like the menu enabled me to make a request for some food a url will
enable me to make a request for some complex set of data or some sort of
action that happens on the server and get a response
now there are apis that we can use from everywhere we have web apis that we're
going to use tonight where we're worried about getting data from a server but
there are apis built into our computers there's apis built into everything that

02:04
you use because all an api is is a simple interface for something
complex you've been using interfaces all day long you might have used the light
switch you might have hit a key we have all these beautiful interfaces that we
use all the time that enable us to do some complex actions cool
now when we talk about an application programming interface
we gotta we're gonna we're gonna start throwing out some of those more meaty
terms but let's save that for for tuesday let's just worry about like what an
interface is in this case our interface will be a url all right it'll be a url
we'll use that url that url will enable us to make a request to some server
that server will hear our request and it's going to do a bunch of stuff
it's going to do a bunch of stuff once it's done doing that stuff it's

02:05
going to respond and the stuff it's going to respond with
is typically going to be formatted in json the apis we're going to be using
tonight the web apis that we'll be using tonight we'll hear our request
and respond with json or a javascript object
right javascript object notation and so we're going to get this lovely
object back and so once we get this object back we
can do whatever the heck we want with it we can pull different properties out we
can run the methods that it came with but all we're doing
is we're using an interface which instead of it being a light switch or a
button or a menu it is a url the server here's our request
it has some code that's been written to hear that request
generate the response and then respond with that json
the stuff that's sitting on the server that hears our request and generates the

02:06
response what kind of code is that yeah that's back end code a lot of the
first back-end code we're going to write is the build our own api something that
here's a request knows how to generate a response and then responds with that
json object so we're going to use other people's apis
tonight but one of the very first things
we'll do in the back end is make our own apis and so i think that's pretty cool
all right so here is a simple bit of syntax
that enables us to access web apis while using a url
we plug in our url or our interface and we're able to get some data back from a
server so here i have a couple big pieces we have this lovely fetch method

02:07
and you can kind of see we chain these other methods the then the then the catch
eventually we'll build up to why we're what these are these are
promises we don't have to worry about that yet when we get the object oriented
we'll learn about promises then we'll learn about async await we'll learn
about all these other wonderful things that we will learn down the line
but let's not worry about understanding what the heck
a promise is let's not worry about wondering what the heck async away is
let's just learn how to use an api and get some data and have some fun with it
cool so this fetch is what enables us to use our interface
i promise i won't worry exactly enables us to use our interface which is
just the url and we're going to get some data back
and this very first line here says hey just treat whatever is coming back as
json so just that treat it as like a big old object
and then whatever came back we're going to pass through this parameter of data

02:08
so whatever we get back from that server is going to be passed into this
parameter of data so if i want to see what's coming back from the server one
of the first things i'm going to do is just console log data
if something was to go wrong our error will be printed to the console
so we don't have to worry about how this is working
or what exactly it's doing tonight that's not our goal we'll have plenty of
time where we break down this line by line by line also we've got to know that
this is a pattern that we can use to make a request to a server and get
some pretty cool data back that's it that's where i want your brain tonight
all right we're going to make fetch happen tonight and that's all we're doing
know that we can plug in our different urls and we can console log the data that
comes back or use it however we want what does rest stand for it doesn't

02:09
matter what it what this would be because this is just a what
res and data are just what they're just parameters yeah we could
have called this robot we could have called this unicorn it really doesn't
matter it just it just it's pretty standard for people to use res short for
response like the response you're getting back
from the server and then people use all different types of parameters whatever
they want to call it here but if you look
this is just a a method right we can see that it has the parentheses we're
running it right kind of like if we had like a map
or a for each or other things that we've seen before just parameters yeah cool
this is out of your comfort zone no it shouldn't be because we're we're
trusting in this idea that none of this matters except for two things one
that this is where we plug in our url and two this is where we see our
response that's all we're worried about tonight all this other stuff is gravy

02:10
we'll get there down the line json derulo hey thank you for the gift
itselves thank you for being here hope you're doing well
jason derula always shows up when we need the most alrighty so
we looked at an original example which was our dog photos example so
let's go and take a look at this again uh we have this idea
if we go to the dog photos example we have an html file and a js file
and what i want to be able to do is get a dog photo from the dog ceo api
and place that photo into the dom if i look in my html file i have an image
right an image i wouldn't be able to take the value i got from the dog ceo api

02:11
and plug it into this image here now we've done this once together very
quickly in in class uh last tuesday and then if you were with
mayan wolf mayan wolf went through this in way more detail than we're going to
get to right and so what i want you to do is i want you to take three minutes
you're really going to copy and paste copy and paste
see if you can get the value out of the object and then see if you can plug it
into the dom cool we're gonna put just a few minutes on the clock here
let's put four minutes on the clock i want you to go ahead
we want you to go ahead grab the value right grab the value
see if you can plug the photo into the dom let's go ahead and i'll pull up the
slide that has you can see the code we're going to use

02:12
the code that we have we already have the interface which is the dog ceo api
i need you to go and get a response from the api and plug that
photo into the dom try it yeah three minutes 30 seconds to make it happen
we already did this try it again why does data have curly braces and res
doesn't because res is on one line using that implicit return and then data is
also an arrow function but we want to be able to have multiple lines so we have

02:13
the curly braces because we might not just do it all in one line
arch we've actually done this before in class
you're really just copying and pasting on this one
and then mine did it as well my wife did it as well so yes
you should be a little bit more comfortable with this
then it's because that's just how it works that's how they built it out they
built it out to handle those two specific things in that order

02:14
rest is just a parameter click on whatever you want but it's short for response
no way juice to go way faster can we have a yolo maybe maybe
i gotta be careful with the yolos folks are getting too close
if i paid you would you eat papa john's no

02:15
pretty comfortable there's no amount of money that would make me papa john's
the crafty sheep thank you for the hydration cheers to you
what if they sponsored a class never i they would never be able to sponsor
this stream your ads are papa john ads hey i can't
hate the game right can't hate the game we do is talk about pizza on this stream

02:16
it makes sense all right let's go through and take a look at this together
i am going to copy and paste boom copy i have my fetch boom
i already have my url in place right like i already have my url where uh my
interface let's go ahead and save and see what we
have working for us let's go ahead and open this in the browser
let's open up our inspector go to the console and we can see we're
getting an object great we're getting an object we see
that that object has to what to what true properties nice yeah i have no
control over the ads so uh if you keep spamming ads it does
nothing for me i can't i can't help you i'm sorry we run ads during the break
and um normally that works for most folks but sorry uh

02:17
nothing i can control there messages and status we have two
properties right we have two properties message and status and so it's part of
one object right and so what i can do is i can grab
either of these properties right so let's go and take a look
if we look at our fetch we can see that everything that's coming
back from the server is gonna pass through this function yeah
yeah if you refresh and come back in you get you get pre-roll ads
and so yeah i think that's just kind of one of the downsides of refreshing
unfortunately yeah cool so everything that comes back from
this server right everything that comes back from this request
is going to be passed through into this method and going to be passed
through data so wherever i see data right wherever i see data

02:18
that's the response that has come back from the server and so you can actually
see us console.log right we console logged the response that came back
and since we console logged that response right since we console logged that
response we were able to see the object that came back from the dog ceo right
he's so cute he can't really stand up yet so simba got up off of his like
mattress that's probably more expensive than my mattress and like stumbled
closer to me and then kind of laid on the on the carpet next to me
he's doing all right he's good all right so we can see that

02:19
we got the object uh back from the we got the object back from the api
so what happened is if we were to draw this we had my laptop
that request left my laptop went to the dog ceo server
the dog ceo server heard that request and it did some stuff maybe it had to go
to the database maybe has like a database of dog photos
like the code went and got the photo from the database or the link to the
photo from the database and then it responded to my machine with that data
and that data was formatted as json and so we were able to use that json
object and what we did with it is we console logged it
and the cool thing is since it's just an object now
right once once we know that's an object

02:20
we can we can treat it like an object we saw that it had two properties it had a
message property and a status property and we can see
that this message property is just an image so let's go ahead and just do
data.message save it come back refresh and now we're just getting that image url
now before we use the image url i got to ask you a question
for the first year that i use this code to get data back from an api
do you think i could code it from scratch
like probably for like the first year i ever used this code
i was using it all the time every every day every week
no hell no i had no idea what this meant or how it worked or
or what all these bits meant i just knew if i used this specific code
i could make a request to this url and get my data back

02:21
eventually i learned more right i learned what promises were i
learned a single way i learned all these other things
but for like literally the first year that i was working with eight probably
more than that probably like first two years i was using apis i had no idea
what any of this crap meant or what was really happening underneath
the hood i just knew with my big brain that if i put the url there
i got some stuff back and i could use it
that's it so take that pressure off your shoulders right now you don't need to
know more than that makes requests gets a response back that's all we're doing
right now all right so i am console logging that url that to
the image but let's actually use it so document.queryselector

02:22
let's grab the image grab the image and we are going to
use the source we're going to change the source of that image and we're just
going to set it equal to data dot message cool let's save it
let's see if we can get it to work let me move this over a little bit
let's refresh boom [Laughter] oh looks like uh so i used to have a dog
named cheeky's and that looks that reminds me of cheeky's
although i would never would have been able to get a hat on her that would
never would have happened that's so cool let's refresh see if we

02:23
get a different dog back this time no fluffers so each time
i refresh i'm making a new what each time i i refresh i'm making a what
yeah i'm making a request to their server
and their server hears that request and it responds
with that lovely json that i can use i can take that object right
i can take that object i can pull the pieces out that i want and i can use
them to my advantage so what i did is i went ahead and i grabbed the uh
url that they gave me i saw that i was getting back a bunch of data i'm able to
parse through that data and grab the bits and bobs that i want cool
now if you want to see this taken to the next level
you got to go back and watch mine wolf's vod uh so mine wolf if you if you're

02:24
watching me live right now you'll notice underneath my name there
should be like somewhere that says a hundred devs
a hundred devs is our stream team you can see all the folks that are on the
stream team if you click on that you'll see mine wolf you can go directly to
their channel and grab the vod after class if you want uh it's also linked in
the follow-on materials channel watch the vod if you want to take this
to the next level right they use this added so much more stuff to it spent
more time going through it so you can see how you could use this to make even
more even bigger of a project cool it's working hey cool
let's move on to our next one so next the next api i want to use or the
next interface i want to use is the cocktail database
and the cool thing about the cocktail database is that it gives us a lot of
different interfaces that we can use to our advantage so here we go

02:25
i went to thecocktaildb.com that was a risky type
and inside the cocktail database you can see there's a bunch of these interfaces
which are all just different urls that i can use to get different data back
right i can use to get different data back so we're going to use this to get
different drinks back from the database um just so that you know there is a
non-alcoholic version of this so if you don't want to be dealing with alcoholic
drinks you can use the non-alcoholic version of this as well cool
so the first kind of url that i see or the first interface i see is the
cocktaildatabase.com all this stuff but at the very end
i have the question mark s equals margarita
and so if i make a little bit bigger so we can see it we can see that it's
question mark s margarita and so what we're going to notice

02:26
right what we're going to notice is that sometimes we have the interface
which is the url but sometimes we can add query parameters
so that the server knows specifically what we want
all right it shows the query parameters that it enables me to say look you know
what i don't want any specific kind of drink i want a margarita back and so we
can use these query parameters to get certain stuff back from the server now
the server has to be coded to be listening for those query parameters so this
interface this url has been coded on their end so that when it sees s equals
it only grabs stuff that's tied to whatever you put there
so let's go ahead and take and look and see if we can use this
uh with what we've been using so far so i have the shots

02:27
object shots folder and that's where i'm going to start so object shots and what
i want to be able to do is i want the user to be able to enter a cocktail
and then get the name photo and instructions on how to make that cocktail
so the idea would be that the user could enter in a margarita and they would get
back the name the photo and the instructions on how to make the margarita okay
so i want folks to take a few minutes to try this on their own remember you're
just gonna take the fetch that we used right the fetch that we used
you're going to use that fetch here you're going to use the new interface
the new url see what you get back see if you can parse through what we got
back see if you can use it to your advantage
all right so this is in the object shots uh you want to be able to enter in a
cocktail and get the name the photo the instructions and place them in the dom

02:28
the url itself is in the slides uh and it's
and you can use it i'll leave the slides
up so you can see if you need to grab it um and then
we're gonna put five minutes on the clock here and then we'll go over it
together i want you to try try play with it break it see what comes back
have some fun with it put the link in chat too

02:29
you're getting some chorus errors make sure you're using https
checking off your vpn on and then you have to google how to get around it
yeah make sure you're using https this is what we're doing
these just be able to enter in a cocktail get the name the photo and the

02:30
instructions and put them in the dom all right got this
we talk with about api keys yeah when we get there let me get there so
why did the fetch get different dog images instead of a specific one because

02:31
they just returned a random one with each request glad to hear it stormtrooper
very make sure you're using the right url double check

02:32
we'll go through it together instructions are in this in the actual
uh setup you're just trying to get a drink back that's all

02:33
a minute left and we'll go over it together 30 seconds and we'll do it together
you get errors you got to google them errors are a good thing punch in the
right direction no errors is when you got to get scared
all right folks let's go over this together come on back
all right so we had our fetch um that we had from the previous the dog photos
let's just grab this fetch and let's put it over here into the the object shots
and we just need to change the url out so i gave you the url on the slides
let's try this url first if anything happens with it

02:34
make sure it works if not we'll grab the one directly from the site
boom let's save it and i'm just gonna go ahead and open this in the browser
so open it in the browser let's open up the inspector
and we're getting a fail to load resource error file not found undefined one
we go to our line five we have an error here
we have an error it told me on line 5 there is an error
what's the what's the line 5 error it's probably not a message property
right that was specific to the dog cpo the dog ceo api that i was using let's
go ahead and save this let's go back and uh let's refresh again we'll refresh

02:35
great awesome we got a lovely drinks array back
and if we look at this drinks array there's a lot of stuff in here
we got like this object let's see we have an object that has a drinks property
and that drinks property right that drinks property has an array inside of it
right has an array inside of it let's go back and take a look oh we also have
this stuff done here right we don't need this anymore boom let's get rid of this
that'll probably get rid of the error too we can just see the object in there
cool so i got back an object and that object has a drinks property
and that drinks property is an array of objects we see that right all the
objects that are inside of that so let's
just narrow this down a little bit let's just grab the drinks property and see

02:36
what we get so data dot drinks cool the data dot drinks
and now we're just dealing with the array right we did we saw that there was
drinks in there there was there was an array in there
right so we just had drinks to drill into it to drill into it just a little
bit and now we're just dealing with the array
we can see that the array it has a bunch of objects inside of it
how could i grab the first object out of this array index zero yeah let's try it
drinks index zero let's save it let's see what we get
remember this is all about being playful trying it sometimes it works sometimes
it doesn't and there we go now we have just an individual

02:37
we have an individual object that came out of that array that came with that
big old object so all i did is i just drilled down right let's let's delete it
and go all the way back let's start with just data just data let's start there
we can see that we got this object back and that object has a drinks property
which is an array and if we look it's an array of objects
so i can go drinks and then grab the first object
using our array notation so let's go ahead and do dot dot drinks
square bracket zero it's gonna grab the first drink out
let's save this and refresh again and so now i'm getting an individual drink we
can see that it is a margarita um we see all this stuff about like all
the stuff that came from the uh from the the response

02:38
and so i like a few things here i want i want the drink
name oh here we go extra drink is probably the name of the drink
i'm gonna want the thumbnail like the picture of the drink and then i want the
instructions on how to make the drink and i'm gonna want to put them into
the dom so let's go ahead and do that do we have anything in our html let's just
check oh we do we have a place to put the name
we have a place to put the image and we have a place to put the instructions
so we'll just target the h2 the image in the h3 cool
h2 the image in the h3 let's start there so we can just do our normal document
dot query selector and we're going to target that

02:39
h2 and we're going to put inside of it whatever it was in that first drink so
we know that it's data.drinks0 let's grab that to start and then
what was the name of the property for the drink name i think it was just a drink
all right extra drink so we can just do straw drink let's copy that and do dot
drink all right let's save this let's see if
we get anything popping up into the h2 all right
margarita showing up in the h2 spot right margarita showing up in the h2 spot
nice cool let's go ahead and let's take a peek while we have the object up

02:40
let's see um straight drink thumb is the name of the property that has the
image in it so let's go ahead and try using that so i'm going to do my document
dot query selector i think this is one of those ones where you're probably not
trying to frantically copy along with me just pay attention to what we're doing
so that we can kind of get there together but with an image i'm not using inner
text what am i going to use to change an image yeah source
and it's going to be the same thing we have up here the data drinks zero
but instead of being extra drink it was extra drink thumb the straw drink thumb
was the name of the property that was holding the image url

02:41
let's save this let's go back let's refresh that's a massive image
that's a really big image let's just do some quick css real quick [Music]
css style.css come down here oh we already have
something for the image let's go and do image let's just do with i don't know
well let's not do with let's do height 200 pixels there we go height 200 pixels
and that should just make sure that the image is smaller
they're not save right let's refresh there we go cool
so now we have like the smaller image and the last bit was the instructions
was the instructions so let's see in here uh straw
instructions is what it's called let's go ahead let's go back to our javascript

02:42
we're going to target that h3 document.queryselector let's target the h3
we'll use inner text again remember inner text just enables us to put text
inside the element we're going to grab the drinks again
but it's not going to be drink thumb we just saw that extra instructions
and i don't trust myself to spell it right so i'm just going to copy it and boom
and so this is a lot of like your early api work where you are just kind of like
looking at the object picking it apart trying to get pieces
out playing with it sometimes it breaks sometimes it's not sometimes you dig
deeper sometimes you have to go back up a level let's save this let's go back
cool so now we have a margarita with the photo
and the instructions to make it let's go i love it cool um but right now

02:43
this is uh hard-coded this is hard-coded this will uh only
this will only give me margaritas i need a way of like changing what this is
so that i can get stuff that's not a margarita so what i want to do is
inside this html we have an input and a button so what i want to do is i
want to get the value out of the input and use that as part of my request
so we're not hard coding margarita right how could i
get the value out of the input when i press the button what do i need

02:44
we need an event listener so let's go ahead and create an event listener
uh and there was nothing special about that it was just button yeah it's just a
button doesn't even have an id there's only one button so we just use the
button so we can say let's come up here document dot query selector
we'll say button and then we'll say add event listener
we'll need the click and then we'll call our function uh get drink cool
let's go ahead and create a function called get drink
and what i'll do is i'll put the fetch inside of that function
and the reason why i need to put the fetch inside this function is because i
eventually only want the fetch to run once i've gotten the value out of the um

02:45
the value out of the input so let's how do we get the value out of an input
we've seen this pattern before definitely should be in your anki by now
yeah dot values let's do document dot query selector input dot value
and we we have to do what with it right now it would just like poof out of thin
air use a template i got you it would just poof out of thin air um
you gotta store it so let's just call this like let drink equal and
that'll be the value that the user entered and then we want to plug it in here
so what we could do is we could use a template literal
where i turn this into ticks and instead of hard coding margarita we can

02:46
put in our bling drink there we go try it if it'll be on one line there you go
so now what's going to happen is we will click our button
will grab the drink out of the input and then instead of just having
margarita hardcoded it'll now be it'll be whatever drink we pass in cool
let's save this let's not get wild right off the gate let's use the
thing we know already works let's grab the margarita and [Music]
what time is this in there we go and let's come back here let's refresh
uh notice how we're not getting anything by default anymore right
notice how we're not getting anything by

02:47
default because we've now said all right we gotta plug in what we want
we're gonna click the button first try let's go first try
the training wheels are coming off just like rip my shirt that's only fans
content or else i would let's try a different type of drink let's try gin
nothing makes you want to fight like gin all right here we go we got a gin fizz
back with the image and the ingredients to make it
i'm a whiskey drinker though so let's do whiskey beautiful we got a whiskey sour
all right got a whiskey sour and we get the image we get the shake and ice

02:48
first try and you can still see that we um
you can still see that we have the like the still the console logs are there so
you can see the console log that's coming through each time
but we're using the data a little bit differently now so
we click the button which fires our function get drink
the first thing we do is get the value out of the input
and then we make our fetch like normal except this
url this interface that we're using it has a query parameter
that enables us to plug in the different drinks that we would want beautiful
now we can get different drinks back now there's a couple of things that i
want you to work on because we're we're kind of at the end of our time tonight
there's some things i want you to work on for homework one

02:49
this right now would have a hard time with having spaces
in the drinks that we're asking for right so if we ask for a drink that has
a space in it right now it might it might might not work we'll actually use
a template literal but try it out see if you can make it work with names have
spaces in it now the push homework is we know that when we make a request
right if we console log let's get rid of the drink zero because we don't want
just the first one let's save this let's go back let's refresh let's put in gin
we can see that when we put in gin we get 20 different drinks
right we get 20 different drinks and so what i want you to do
is i want you to see if you can make it cycle through the
drinks that's the push homework the push

02:50
homework is to see if you can make it be like a carousel right a carousel
of drinks and the non-push homework is try this without a template literal
and see if you can get it working with things like a moscow mule a drink that
has a space in it the template literals help you here but if we didn't use a
template literal play with it but really what i want you
to do is just play with this right play with the code here break it see what you
get back from the objects that are coming in tear it apart right
make sure that you play with this stuff apis are meant to be played with you're
meant to for stuff to break and to get on discord and say why am i getting this
error so please as you are playing with this come ask questions on discord make
sure everything is going the way you want it and then have fun with it make
this app do something we saw all look at all this data that we have for each
drink there's no reason why you can't have other stuff showing up

02:51
different ingredients showing maybe maybe yours is ingredients showing up right
cool now there's one other thing i want you to work on before homework
idel hey thank you for the stretch hold on you know we gotta
i can't do this live oh yeah okay thank you for the stretch all right so
the other bit of homework that we have tonight is instead of playing just
playing with the cocktail database right that's what i want you to play with
make it different do something to it break it if you want to push see if you
can get it to be a carousel the other bit of homework is nasa has a

02:52
bunch of wonderful apis right nasa has a bunch of wonderful apis
uh one of these apis is the picture of the day i want you to try and getting
the nasa picture of the api the nasa picture of the day api
working can you get an image back from nasa
and then we will take it a step further during our next class next class we'll
work with the nasa data to not only get photos back but to get them back for
specific dates at a specific time right so we can we can we can we can get them
back and we'll be able to handle a bunch of edge cases so your homework i want
you to work on before next class is to play around with the cocktail database
try the different urls try the different
endpoints try these different pieces and play with it have some fun with it and
then try and get the nasa picture of the day api working we have um

02:53
some other stuff here in the homework remember i want you to play with the
cocktail database try getting the nasa api working and then your homework that
won't be due tuesday which will be due thursday is to build three really simple
apps like we just did i want you to try using some public apis
to build some simple apps just use the fetch that we did
plug in a different url and see what you get back some of these apis in this
public api list won't work they just they're just it's just an old
list so some of them will work some of them won't
make sure you're still doing your code wars daily make sure you're still doing
your anki daily and uh thank you for the best week ever and we we can't we can't
we can't just end the best week ever like normal
we gotta end the best week ever with a very special raid and it is my absolute

02:54
pleasure and privilege to raid hello its rufio one of my dreams folks is to
always just raid folks that are part of the stream team and so hello's roofio is
holding it down for us we're going to go ahead and raid them tonight if you
haven't yet please do me a favor give them a follow
it's amazing to see somebody code from a different perspective it's it's amazing
to see them code through things that are not through my eyes you will learn so
much more uh about the things we're working on when you watch somebody else work
through them where you participate and help them work through the code as well
so we're going to go ahead and raid hello it's rufio
have a wonderful rest of your evening have a wonderful weekend good luck with
the homework and i will see you all for office hours on sunday
if any of this stuff is tripping you up come to office hours we're gonna have
some fun playing with more apis and we're back at it next week more more api

02:55
fun bigger projects better projects i hope you're ready to have some fun peace
everyone have a good night peace youtube
