this class tonight we uh we're gonna get
a lot of review in a lot of review a lot of practice it's all about practice
tonight folks all about practice we're going to practice our relationship

00:05
selectors we're going to practice our specificity we're going to practice our
box model go deeper with the box model we're going to practice
everything that we've kind of seen so far in terms of html and css lots of
rounds of of working through code on your own and working through code
together we got the bro already right so if you feel if you feel like things
everything hasn't clicked yet that's okay that's tonight's class is to get
you getting lots of hands on keyboard lots of practice then us doing it
together so you can see my responses we're gonna go over some of the stuff
that was uh due for homework today so you'll get to see some some walkthroughs
of that work as well we'll save a bunch of it for our for our sunday office
hours as well but lots of practice and then we're going to hint at
responsiveness so responsiveness is making sure that our layouts uh work
well and look good across multiple devices whether it be a desktop a tablet

00:06
a mobile phone and so we're also going to hint at that tonight we're going to
see the main mechanism that enables you to build responsive websites and then
all next week will just be deep diving into responsiveness so glad you're here
glad to get some uh get some practice in
all right be a good one have some fun uh but as always
i'd like to start off with questions around here folks we like to start off
with questions and so the question of the evening
is would you rather be a superhero or a wizard
so hero or wizard in in chat for me please hero wizard for me in chat ooh
look at the wizards coming in you hear is it all into look at all the wizards
what that's wild to me i mean i'm i'm definitely going wizard

00:07
but i didn't think it would be this overwhelming
y'all from reddit that's what it is y'all from reddit you also wizard people
that's what y'all are definitely some wizards
oh wow there's a lot okay there there's some heroes coming through some folks
that want to be uh super saiyans but rude i i i have my like 12 or 13-year badge
on reddit so like i i that ain't no shade that's me
i've been there y'all i've been in the trenches
okay all right i think i think it's pretty this is a wrap this is definitely
in the in the wizards it was its category i i didn't know if it would be uh
i didn't know if it would be more heroey this time but not y'all there's some
heroes but it's mainly wizards all right cool

00:08
thank you for sharing everybody how about regular questions as we let folks
get in you you ran and got the kids and now
you're jumping in front of the computer let's give those folks a second or two
to get in here questions i always like to start off with questions
what is your hype intro song i actually don't know the name of it
um believe it or not it just comes with stream like the stream deck software
like like stream deck has a bunch of sounds that you can just click and install
and i went through like all of them and found this one
different said how are you i'm doing good today was a pretty chill day for me uh
excited to to to get into this lecture this is a fun one i just like i like the
ones where we just practice a lot i think it helps a lot of folks and i
think it's fun to like goof around and find selectors that we
would never do in real life but we can have some fun with it i like that um

00:09
i was working on a special project i don't want to mention it yet uh but
i'll mention it i i we have a lot of folks that have been asking about like a
minecraft server and i didn't want to do another
minecraft service cohort just because not everyone can play minecraft for free
right now this is also assuming that you have like a
a computer that can play it right but um minecraft's not free so i don't want to
do another server but i i have a 64-person cs go server right now
64-person cs go server that i've been setting up and so that's been a lot of
fun i've been playing around getting the settings dialed in uh so cs go is
completely free it can run on a potato uh so maybe maybe this weekend it'll
i'll open it up just to get some practice in but yes that's been
something fun that i was working on there's also like csgo on consoles too but

00:10
bless you if you can do do that with a console with a controller
other questions just to give folks a second to get in here i always like to
start off with a question who's your smash bros name i'm not like super i'm
not like i'm not like good at smash brothers let's just put that out there
i'm not good at it i love ganondorf i like the heavy characters um
i'll play around with that uh a lot of my friends play
zelda so i've been playing a little bit a little bit of a little bit of zelda
recently then i like some of the pokemon characters dude i love pikachu
i i get myself in too much trouble with pikachu
or two more questions and we'll get in here when can we meet your pets uh
one of the days when they like feel like they want to come in here and just hang

00:11
out a little bit we'll set up the the simba cam and yeah they got to get
comfortable with me streaming again and then once once they know i'm like this
is stream time they'll start coming in more and i'll put them on and then
eventually we'll set up the simba cam a lot of people saying pokemon legends
i'm excited i'm excited the bingo link is exclamation point bingo
what linux distro do you like the most debian a debian person
can we go over grid we're going to get to flex and grid next week you know
all right folks i think we got i think we got the the gangs all here uh let's

00:12
get into tonight let's get into kind of what we're going to be covering
uh we're going to be reviewing some of our html fundamentals yes we're going
all the way back folks all the way back we we love to get our space repetition
in around these parts right love to get our space repetition in underneath in
these parts then we're going to hit up some css fundamentals we're going to
move into the box model we're going to do a floats and then
we're gonna do our layouts you know what i forgot to do
i'm just realizing it now i didn't send out the email today
i'm glad you're all here but now we get to know how people show up when i don't
send out the email versus when i do send out the email
uh so rip sorry folks that rely on the email to get here but i forgot it
that's weird hey dab thank you for the five gift it subs
there's an email yeah there's an email we got like almost 12 000 people on the

00:13
email list and it goes out before each class [Music]
exclamation point newsletter if you're not on there you can do estimation point
newsletter if you want to join the email list but uh yeah rip
i didn't set up the email oh that's a bummer all right well
hopefully folks find their way over alrighty we're going to review our html
fundamentals we're going to go over our css fundamentals
matinee hey thank you for the 10 gift itself that's wild thank you so much
batney831 thank you for the gift all the gifted subs i appreciate that
we're going to go over the box model uh we're going to go over floats again a
little bit we're going to see layouts with floats again i know how there we're
going to review the layouts that are due today and then we're just going to hint
on a little bit of responsive basics just the the little key mechanisms that

00:14
we need right the key mechanisms that we need to to make sure that our sites are
responsive cool and then homework will be to make the simple site
uh the the simple layout that we go over at the end of class responsive we'll
talk about that at the end cool all right good questions if you're
new around here would like to check in at the beginning of each class
exclamation point check in all right estimation point check in
you can go ahead and like and retweet that please i appreciate it
and that just helps more folks find our community hopefully save them a few
bucks and learning how to code i'm glad you're all here and thank you always for
checking in i'd love to read the messages that you put on those is always
pretty funny alrighty you checked in uh the next big thing that was in the
discord message for today um the message that was in discord today uh always has

00:15
the materials that you need so if you're new or you're watching on say youtube
you can always go to our discord leonardo.com
discord or if you're here live on twitch it's exclamation point discord
on discord we always have the materials we always have the ability for you to
download the things that you need to download for the for the class but i
also share a lot of links for you that you're going to need for the class
and one of those was our student our study community
survey so we've talked a lot about making
smaller study communities that folks can join
to just have a smaller more intimate experience as they go through 100 devs
and so that survey is live now you can click the link that's in the
slides or you can look at the discord message that had the link
you don't want to fill it out right now don't worry about it you have until
tuesday to fill it out but take until tuesday to fill it out and on tuesday

00:16
we'll kind of compile them all and we're going to start kind of figuring out how
how many we're going to have and who's going to go into what and so yeah make
sure you fill out that survey if you're interested and then we're going to start
getting folks into those communities don't worry if you've already filled it
out that's great just saying you don't the russian do it right now so
our idea of the study community is just a smaller group of folks
that are tied together by some sort of bond whether it be affinity or identity
or location and so go ahead and fill that out and we're going to kind of compile
a good group of them and turn them into special spaces on discord so they'll
have their own chat their own voice channels etc
we lose access to more general channels no not at all these are just like
special or places for folks to have access to just because the general
the general channels on discord can be uh quite overwhelming

00:17
right uh quite overwhelming we we recently have a bunch of memers
that are uh that are just i don't know how you all type so much
but some of you all be in that discord i look at your messages you got like 400
messages in the last hour i just don't know how you do it um but sometimes
those groups can be a little a little overwhelming and so uh we want to have
smaller groups where where you can you can you can kind of get to know each
other a little bit better chat will go a little bit slower right
and uh yeah that's the whole point so it's just kind of like to give you a
smaller group where you can get to know folks and and kind of commiserate and go
through the experience together cool all right so go ahead you have until
tuesday to fill it out uh the survey kind of lists the
different things that you might be interested in we do have an other
category where you can list like some other options for us to separate them by

00:18
commas you can put in more than one location if you want just separate it by
comma and we're gonna kind of compile the most
commonly asked and turn them into groups the link is here on the slides and it's
on discord in the following materials channel for today too oh alrighty
don't worry about filling out the form again it won't it won't change anything
this isn't the the final form that gets you into it it's the form for us to set
up the the most common channels can we get confirmation that we turned
in the homework uh no i mean if you filled out the form you're good don't
worry about it yeah you're fine when you when you fill out the forms
there's like a confirmation page as long
as you see that confirmation page you're always good yeah don't worry about it
cool tomorrow alumni twitter space uh we got

00:19
we got three wonderful alumni uh that are going to
uh join us in the twitter space including one of our fabulous mods here
blog and so join us tomorrow on twitter at six
o'clock i'm gonna share the space on discord and via email uh so you'll
you'll get the actual link to the space um so you can join us if you would like
and we're gonna have three alumni there we're going to use slido so you can ask
a bunch of questions and i'll kind of help moderate and ask questions to the
alumni that are there you get to hear kind of about their background and their
experience and how they got to where they are aka
employed uh and so i think it'd be cool we got a pretty wide range of past
experience um and and i think that will be really
helpful for folks that are trying to find their way as well so tomorrow if
you want to join us twitter space with alumni we're going to do these a little
bit more frequently uh bring in more folks over time it'll be recorded so

00:20
don't worry if you miss it you'll be able to watch the listen to the
recording if you want is it mobile device friendly yes it
actually only really works well on mobile um
you can listen to it in the in on your desktop or in the browser but the
experience is almost always better on mobile for some reason how does it work
i'll share a link you tap the link and you just kind of jump into a voice
channel basically uh it's a big voice channel but only the folks that are
speakers can talk you can like raise your hand and like like stuff and then
we can bring up folks that want to ask questions if we want but we're going to
be using slido for questions mainly yeah yep can we have a wizard's channel
alrighty submitting work uh we have a little bit of work that has

00:21
to be submitted today well quite a lot of work needs to be sent today uh one is
the simple site labs that was due today that was the one with the the learn with
leon logo in it and the beautiful colors and then your layouts were due today as
well so you can use codepen you can use glitch
you can use replit i'm not just going to
say glitch anymore because we bring them down every time and i don't want us to
do that to them anymore so codepen glitch replit share out the wealth
the idea is i just want to see your html and css i don't care about you having
good image links i don't care about stuff being connected i just want to see
the html i want to see the css so uh throw them into separate code pens or
separate glitches and then submit them in the form
yeah don't worry about images especially
like on co-pins people have like trouble with them there don't worry codepen

00:22
glitch replit whatever whatever you can just just to make it a little bit easier
and not to bring down servers whoa izzy with the pokemon card that's dope
all right izzy send me i'll send you uh well i'll send you a whisper
uh and uh we gotta we gotta get that coming to you but we have to do
the uh random drawing uh so let's see get which one it is let's see pokemon
here we go all right so here is the current pokemon cards
uh so izzy just used i think it's 50k right now uh yeah 50k channel points and

00:23
we're gonna do a random for one of the cards so we have 64 slots
um if we hit one we just redo it again but uh or sorry if we hit one or two we
just redo it again um but yeah anything from three to 64
counts and we're just going to do it randomly
all right we're going to do it randomly and we're gonna do it live
so let's just go ahead and open up an inspector go to console make this bigger
oop i know we had the math.random there we go
all right so we got math.random times 64.
so what this what this is saying for for folks that are new um
is we we have something built into javascript called math.random

00:24
which can return a random number between zero and one
and so we're going to do is we're going to times that by 64 and
round it so we should get a number between 1 and 64. so whatever number
this is is the card that they get so 3 2 one 41 is it and 41 is a smoothie
i'll get that to you um and i'll send you a message here on twitch
make sure that goes your way too loud yeah that was loud alrighty congrats

00:25
so yeah channel points are fun folks the more you hang out the more channel
points you get uh the the more cool stuff you can do
congrats izzy all right so we got our submitting our homework
that was uh 50 000 channel points alrighty a couple things i want to talk
about before we jump into the practice tonight
uh one we hinted at it a little bit last class but i want to bring it up again
sleep you need to get good sleep if you're
lucky you can get good sleep but please make it a priority please don't put
way too much time into studying that it impacts your sleep because we're here
for the long run memory consolidation is a real thing and
it happens while you're sleeping and so yes i'm going to share some videos

00:26
uh that have some motivational talks in them and sometimes these people will say
don't sleep i don't agree you're going to need sleep if you want
to learn how to code this is this is not something that you can sheer force of
will this is not something that you can grind for 12 14 hours a day and expect
to actually retain it all so that when you're in an interview you do well
you gotta prioritize sleep okay now i've been there i i get it i get where i
get where hustle coaster comes for i get where i get where grind culture comes
from i i have had some wonderful experiences in my life that have been
the result of not sleeping but let me tell you the dark side
the dark side of success right so i always joke that the the very first like

00:27
money that i raised for my first like one of my first real businesses um
the first hundred thousand dollars i raised let's say that uh all happened
because i slept underneath my desk okay so me and my co-founder we were going
through a program called tech stars and we would stay up really late
grinding away coding building right and we would be so tired that we
didn't want to walk home so we would sleep underneath our desks and then
on fridays we would have uh these vcs that would come in
and they would bring donuts and coffee and it was like 8 30 in the morning so
nobody else was there but we were like come like stumbling out from any of our
desks we would drink their coffee we eat
their donuts we shake their hands we say thank you and then we go back to sleep
underneath our desk they wound up leading my first round
that helped me raised half a million dollars so i've been there i've done the

00:28
the grind i've done the 20-hour days what happened is that did not last
right it got me some initial success but i still have to wear braces on my hand
i still have pain most nights when i go to sleep i would
i burnt out way quicker than i would have imagined uh it contributed to i and
my heart of hearts um some of my earliest manic episodes because i have
bipolar disorder and so yes there can be some advantages of this
grind grind grind grind but i am here to tell you it is not worth it the sleep
will help you consolidate the sleep will help your body repair

00:29
doing this is a very physical exercise i know we're sitting in chairs we're
typing in code but it is a physical exercise we talked about how chess grand
masters spend 6 000 calories in a in a tournament right you're burning and
a lot of calories burning those muscles the the brain cells trying to to learn
that that's heavy it's impactful in your body
and if you're not getting sleep the things that you learn are not going to
stick for the long term the things that you that you
put in all that hard work for will slip away you will develop repetitive stress
injuries you will develop back problems uh you will develop eyesight problems so
it is not worth it to push your body past the point of no return get your sleep
right there always be more time to learn
there always be more time to put in that work but building out right

00:30
building out a plan for your day that includes the time that you're going
to go to bed and the time that you're going to wake might change your life
a lot of folks don't have bedtimes i have a bedtime
i'm a grown-ass man and i got a bedtime and you better bet my bottom dollar i'm
going to bed at that time right because if i don't
if i don't stick to that schedule the the the time slips by the youtube
video keeps playing these companies are very good at getting you to watch just
one more video don't let don't get got all right don't get got
set up a schedule for your week set as a schedule for your day give yourself a
bedtime give yourself a wake-up time and try and stick to it and know
that you're going to slip up all the time it's not a perfect process

00:31
right it's not a perfect process you're going to get it wrong it's not always
going to go right right and so make sure that you just go
into your weeks with a little bit of preparation you go into your days a
little bit of preparation and you try your best right you try your best
but i'm here to say even in some of the videos we're going to share don't think
i'm vouching for it get your sleep please overall it's gonna be one of the
best things you can do to increase your chances of being
successful and learning how to code sleeping is one of the things that i
guarantee you will help you learn how to code better
how many hours do you sleep i sleep about seven and a half every night
i'm a little weirder i find that like if i go over eight it doesn't work out too
well and if i go below seven it's not great and so i'm around like the seven
and a half mark sometimes a little bit later right um
i found that that's that's my sweet spot uh and i use an app that i that i i

00:32
swear by it's called sleepy time uh sleepy uh dot
dm there you go i love sleepy time right uh so if you have any idea of like
when should i go to bed and when should i wake up use sleepy time uh it's just
sleepy time but uh it's dot me right and so let's say you want to wake up at
uh let's say you wanna wake up at i don't know you wanna wake up at seven right
click calculate and it's going to tell you when you
should be falling asleep right so if you want to wake up at seven in the in the
morning right when we get said in the morning you should be falling asleep by 10
o'clock all right you should be falling asleep by 10
o'clock you wanna wake up at seven you should be falling asleep by 10 o'clock
if you miss that window and you're not falling asleep by 10 o'clock do not go
to sleep stay up until you're ready to fall asleep at 11 30.

00:33
right because if you go to sleep in between these windows there's a really
good chance that you uh will wake up in a rem cycle
and when you wake up in a rem cycle you feel really shitty like have you ever
had like a good night of sleep like you've slept for a while but you wake up
and you just don't feel good that's because you probably woke up during a
rem cycle and so this idea of using just a very
simple tool that guesstimates your rem cycles um can be a real real big help
so i started with this now i have a i volt i have a watch that will tell me
like if i'm sleeping well or not and it like does a bunch of other weird stuff
like oxygen levels and all that cool stuff um but sleepy time for me has been
what's um is where i started and it really does help and i just have the numbers
memorized now i know what time i know i know what all my windows are

00:34
and if i don't hit my window i stay up until the next one you know
a brand of watch um it's the garmin instinct solar
yeah instinct solar i weighed it until it was on sale for
um cyber monday and then i got it yeah sleepy time try it out try it out
and here's the thing with sleep too sleep's different for each person
right it's different for each person right the idea from from six to eight
there's like there's lots of room in there some people for some people it's
like like like six to nine hours i think it's the real window some people need a
little bit more to eight some people need a little bit less and it's about
finding your like right your right time um and
exactly uh bipolar plus sleep equals really important for me when i don't
have sleep it's dangerous let's just say that it's it's dangerous oh yeah

00:35
that's my my little caveat and the reason why i didn't want to spend so
much time on that is because i will be sharing a lot of like
motivational videos with you and a lot of those will advocate less sleep
and like we said last time it's not about how many hours it's about what you do
with the hours that you do have some of us might only have the privilege
of an hour a day to study so i rather have somebody that goes hard in
an hour than somebody that kind of just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around for five
right give me somebody that that's focused that's dialed in that's getting their
stuff done that's getting their pomodoro in for an hour
i guarantee you they're putting more down than somebody that's kind of like
not really focused for five so it's not about how much time you have
is about what you do with the time that you have right you owe you

00:36
if you are putting in all this work you owe yourself to use anki
so i gave dr eric thomas's video today you owe you uh it's one of my favorite
videos because he he called me out he got right into my soul he kicked it
around a little bit and i felt it because if i go to best buy
and i buy a new vr headset and i come home
and that vr has that the knobs a little loose
right just a little loose like not not even kind of loose just just uh just
just a little loose i'm i'm back at best
buy i'm always nice hey this didn't work i need my money back give me my money
back it didn't work it's not what i expected and i'm there i'm not there
like in a week i'm there i'm there the next day next day hey
hi thank you very much i need my money back please it didn't work it didn't do
what i expected right i want my money back but i had never asked myself

00:37
for my money back i had to think about that for a second
whenever somebody else does me a little wrong
right whenever somebody else just cheats me a little bit
whenever somebody else kind of kind of uh kind of cuts me a little bit
i'm all up in their stuff but i never do it for myself
i never said i i i owe myself right so you owe you right you owe you
and when if you're putting in all this work if you're showing up if you're one
of the thousands of people here right you owe you to do anki all right
and if you if you don't do it ask yourself why get get get get your
receipt and go demand go demand your money back right you owe you and so
don't do the things that we know have been proven to help people learn right

00:38
the stuff that dr barbara oakley was spitting you gotta take it to heart you
gotta take active recall to heart you gotta take space repetition heart if
you're not doing it this is a waste just stop just stop
it's just not worth your time go do something else go play video games come
join us on the cs go server you're going to do all this put in the
work you owe you all right rant over let's get into it what's the internet folks
what's the internet the wire exactly it's a wire that enables different
devices to communicate enables our client-side requests so our
client-side devices to make requests those requests can leave those

00:39
client-side devices go across those wires and go to servers servers can hear
those requests there's some code running on the servers that can help generate
responses maybe store stuff stuff into a database maybe process a credit card or
two and then it can respond with some stuff okay
all right golden rule separation of concerns we should keep all of our
content in our html we should keep all our style in our css we should keep all
of our behavior interaction and our javascript why why do we keep things
separate why do we keep things [Music] apart and why is this the golden rule
yeah for organization exactly organization for ourselves
an organization for anybody else that we work with right so when somebody else
joins our team right when somebody else asks you to
join uh somebody streams your team and they're asking you hey where do i go
make stuff wiggle you point them to javascript cool alrighty

00:40
here we have the basics of html uh in html every single bit of content
must be wrapped in a tag and the tags almost always follow the same pattern
where they have this lovely opening tag and then this lovely closing tag what
what is the difference oh sorry let's skip that here for a
second we know the difference between like the opening and closing tag is that
the closing tag can have like these forward slash the opening tags can have
like these attribute value pairs when we're talking about like all of these
things we're talking about the carrots we're talking about the the tags we're
talking about all this stuff about how we write
html we call all of that what what up nick how you doing
what do we call all that stuff my bingo card is hot right now
we call that syntax right the spelling the grammar rules the things that make

00:41
up that language we call it syntax so in html the syntax involves opening and
closing tags there's slight differences between those and there are a few tags
that are self closing we saw image tags we might have saw input tags they're
self closing because they're already content they're not wrapping around
content they are content cool all right time for some tags let's
review some of our our important tags here some ones that we've seen in the past
anybody watch this anybody go on youtube and watch
this i'm curious if anybody on youtube and watch the the tag competition
i saw some people on twitter talking about i thought it was funny yeah i know
it's funny it's cool you should watch it i'm i would i i would be the the the
alarm the alarm would go off the alarm would go off and i'd just like slip

00:42
like i'd like and it'd be over they're like they're like jumping from
like bar to bar uh yeah no it would not work out well for me
alrighty uh here we have our heading elements
our heading elements describe content that comes after
right describes content that comes after
so think of like in a newspaper you have a headline and that headline describes
the article that comes after so we have h1s through h6s h1s are supposed to be
the what each one's supposed to be the what big h1 energy
the most important exactly we do not choose our h1s our twos our
threes our fours our fives our sixes based on how they look

00:43
we choose them based on their importance
the h1 being the most important thing on the page it's the most important thing
there should only be one of them slight caveat with html5 sections can now each
have their own h1 right this idea though is that we're bait we're picking them
based off of importance nice we have some elements we saw before we
have paragraphs for larger pieces of text spans for shorter pieces of text
pre-tags which are a what pre-tags are a what what are pre-tags
an abomination thank you an abomination thank you
a great word an abomination yeah there you go a sin whack containing elements

00:44
uh we i keep seeing this question pop up divs
have maybe sometimes that you would use them but we use them sparingly because
we got way more semantically correct elements or just elements with way more
semantic meaning right so i'm finally remembering all these let's go max exactly
yeah uh with way more semantic meaning which means that when you look up the
definition on the mdn there are just times when it makes more sense to use an
article and a side then it would make sense to use a div
so divs can still be used ideally sparingly or when there's not a more semantic
choice to be made still confused the one who used an
article bobby said bobby you use an article when it's meant to be shared

00:45
right when it's content that you could clip out and share with somebody and
they would be able to understand all the content so think of like a newspaper
article a blog post things that could be shared and you could like enjoy and
understand it all on its lonesome would you use divs for styling purposes
no because i don't ever write html with like style in mind because that
gets too close to blurring our separation of concerns
does that mean it has to have a button to be shared no it doesn't have to be a
have a button to be shared now how about an aside i get i get confused
on a slide is just when it's meant to be shared i'm sorry and besides just extra
or ancillary content so things that if you remove from the page the page still

00:46
goes on fine so i like to think about asides like a really good a candidate
for an aside would be what chat what what what is like a pretty much a really
good candidate for an aside ads exactly ads are really good candidates for sides
because the ads if you remove them hopefully the site still still functions well
all right we looked at the bbc solution before
uh what i want to do is i want to mark it up again while we're here
and then what we'll do on sunday is we'll write out some of the html
right we're at some of the html together during uh office hours
but for now i want to mark it up i want to mark up this bbc site

00:47
and let's see what we get alrighty so if i'm looking at this bbc site
uh what would this area up here be what would i consider that to be
yeah i'm going to go with header exactly it's definitely my header
and then inside of that header will be some other things right so
inside the header we can see there's probably a nav right a nav
inside that nav maybe we have some images
uh and it looks like we have like like a
list of links inside of our nav so maybe we have a nav ul li

00:48
anchor tag right like we have our header inside of our header we have our nav
inside of our nav we have our ul inside of our ul we have our individual lis
and then inside of our individual li we probably have our anchor text right
over here we probably have a what inside of our header somewhere a form
exactly we have a form in there and when you're writing out your first bits of
html do not stress about this stuff i see so many people stress about oh
should the form be inside the nav outside the nav should should the image
be outside the nav inside it just doesn't matter in the beginning just get
your work on the board right just get it on the board right

00:49
you work on the board and you'll get better with time cool alrighty next
would this area here be that area appear be yeah
a nice section exactly nice section and then inside of this section i see
kind of like two sections more right like i see like two sections more
and then how about these up here what could these be
maybe they're each different but what what are they
yeah there's some sort of headings right some people might have went with h1 so
many people went with h2s but they're definitely heading elements they

00:50
describe what's happening on the page right definitely some sort of heading
and then if we look inside those sections we probably have like i would probably
consider this to be like an h1 maybe a paragraph and then maybe like a span
right so i say h1 paragraph span and then the funny thing is like this image
i wouldn't actually put in the html that would be a background image in css for
me don't worry about that for now we'll see that when we get there too but for
me that's actually wasn't in the html that was like styling the background of
that section right like that could have been blue and it would have been okay to
me it wasn't content it was style right so we you can add background images in
your css yeah we'll get there um then we have over here i think i
actually kind of see like four more sections here four more sections here

00:51
and each one of those sections has some sort of heading
maybe like an h2 and then like a span i see like those h2s and then spans
or it could be h3s depending on how you think about it
some people like to make these individual ones articles i don't
uh i i do know a lot of people do like to make those articles
to me those aren't articles they're links to articles right
to me they're not articles like i would i wouldn't print this out and share it
with you to me they're like areas to take you to an article right
but i do know so i would hand this to some front-end developers i really
admire and they would make those articles right how about down here another what

00:52
another what down here another section exactly another section cool and then
how about news what would that wind up being yeah some sort of heading element
yep another heading element cool and then i could see maybe like three more
sections here i think some other people might split them up a little bit
differently um this is where this is where it kind of gets
this is where it gets articley for me right this is what this this is where we
kind of this is where it kind of gets a little articley because it has like a
heading and then it like talks about it right
so i could see some people going for with three articles instead of three
sections here like i could see that like if you did that i totally wouldn't

00:53
right wouldn't totally wouldn't even bother me right i
could see that there i don't really see it here this is clearly a section to me
but this starts to blur the line a little bit right this one the ones down
here have a heading they have a photo they have like a paragraph of of content
right so to me this is definitely an image
a heading element of some sort maybe a paragraph and a span
some folks might have used like a figure and a figure caption i don't know if i
would go that far here um but for me i think i would sleep well
with three sections each section having an image a heading
a paragraph and a span i'd sleep okay with that
i could also probably sleep okay with instead of it being a section

00:54
it was an article how about a table not too old school
what is figure caption look it up on the mdn there's there's so many other
elements that we haven't seen yet um and so
there's just so many of them it's just sometimes they come up but the ones that
we covered are pretty much all you'll ever really need honestly
uh that plus what you did in shae hao all right we got about five minutes and
then we'll take a break where does css go that's how we're reviewing everything
tonight reviewing all the stuffs yeah it goes in a separate file exactly
it was in a separate file uh there are some exceptions that we've talked about

00:55
a couple of times now you can put css in line with your html if you're writing
html emails and you can put some css in your head if
you're doing critical path css at amazon but what did we see what did we see
that made it so that we wouldn't want to use
inline style or style in the head like what did we see a bit like what do we
know about it now that makes the inline in the head bad
like why does it make it like like like hard for us to use yeah exactly
under is under the dying stars that's a cool username um yeah it's it's it was
specificity it just if i have inline style how many points
oh that's a good question how many points of specificity does inline style
give you beans hey thank you for the five gifted subs i appreciate that

00:56
yeah if you use inline style if you lose if you use inline style
that's a thousand points of specificity that you somehow have to make up in your
css nobody that's writing like normal css will ever get anywhere close to a
thousand points of specificity they're going to be banging their head against
the keyboard like why are none of my css rules applying like everything looks
good in the css file and then they're going to see that you put some inline
style and they're going to lose it right and we now know that's because
that it just takes up too much specificity yeah too much specificity
whenever we want to link to our css in a
separate file we use our lovely link tag right lovely link tag
that goes in the head of our html document and the actual specific href is

00:57
the location of our style sheet we could put it in any amount of folders that we
want but that css style is saying hey starting at the html file where the link
is go into a css folder and find the style.css now
uh here we have our entire css breakdown uh so let's play our quick
favorite game and then i think we'll we'll probably take our break so uh chat
what is this uh-huh y'all got i thought i was gonna
start with a rule get out of here now you can't type for 30 seconds it's a value

00:58
how about this again i went slow around the property and
everybody started typing property real quick yeah it's a declaration
the declaration nice thank you blah declaration nice how about uh how about this
about that [Laughter] i love seeing the declaration blocks
it's a rule it's a rule right it's a rule it's a rule because it includes the
selector if it did not include the selector

00:59
it was just this what do we got there we got a declaration block exactly and
one last one what is that yep we got a property all right so the
whole thing is a rule all right whole thing's a rule rule's
broken down into a selector and a declaration block declaration blocks are
broken down to declarations and our declarations are broken down into
properties and values all right and once again why might we want to link
to our css in a separate file separation concerns exactly organization
all right we're at the top of the hour if you're new around here we like to
take breaks we like to be healthy we like to make sure
that we're in this for the long haul that we don't develop

01:00
repetitive stress injuries that we let our legs get a good stretch so we get
some water we hydrate please hydrate right hydration is key folks get some
water and so we're gonna put five minutes on our timer
and after those five minutes we'll be right back and we're gonna get our
fingers on the keyboard uh no more just me talking we're gonna start getting
some practice in uh we're gonna practice our css basics uh we're gonna practice
our specificity we're gonna practice our box model i really i really excited to
practice the box i know a lot of folks had some trouble with it
but go ahead just take five minutes get up do what you got to do if you're able

01:04

01:05
and uh i'll see y'all in five my um when am i going to start legends i'm not
sure probably after the alumni space tomorrow
it's not a main series game so i don't feel like i have to do the midnight you

01:06
know all right folks come on back all righty
all right folks come on back come on back was the eye changing software oh flux
flux is what i use flux it changes the color of your screen to
help save your eyes a little bit cool oh no ogx got into some trouble let's see
look it up after class all right folks come on back come on
back hope you had a good break let's uh let's jump into it all right so
let's quickly look at some simple styles and then we're gonna jump into

01:07
actually um typing hey leon how do you feel about numbering
homework assignments nope you got to read your boss isn't going to number your
homework assignments for you right your boss is going to give you a project
you have to get it done so i don't i don't number my assignments
i don't even like numbering classes uh i want you to get better at reading i
want you to get better at organizing i want you to get better at knowing what
to do when it's due because when you get when you get on the job
there it's not gonna be numbered for you so i i i don't do it
you know it's a good question though shoot your shot right
all righty some simple styles we have a couple different ways of doing color
all right uh like a couple ways of doing color

01:08
we can do color keywords we can do hexadecimal we can do rgba we can do
hsla um what's like what's really the difference like what's the difference
between all of these like what could be the difference like what what why like
we have all these different ways but like there's something that can actually
be different across all of these we've talked very briefly about it
performance yeah maybe speed considerations here maybe the time it
might take to look up the color keyword like i mean we're talking like you're
you're maximizing micro seconds here and every count matters right but there's
maybe some speed considerations we met here we do know some browsers are default
hexadecimal i do like the rgb a because it gives us the alpha channel which is a
transparency that's really nice to have it comes in handy hsla also has that
that alpha channel as well so yeah i kind of stick with rgba but
you can use whatever you want when i'm kind of just
mocking around and i'm just doing quick stuff i'll use the color keywords for

01:09
sure all right font family uh so far we've seen the main way that we've been
getting fonts or just from google fonts you don't have to get all your fonts
from google there are plenty of other places to get fonts you can download
fonts locally to your machine so many ways to go about it i just like
the google fonts because they're easy here you can see i have source hands pro
with the fall back so for some reason source stands pro doesn't load uh we
would have helvetica if helvetica didn't load then we just have a regular old
sans serif and we also saw font weight as well
knowing that when you want to use these font families you also have to grab the
specific weights for each of those fonts
fonts are like actual files and you have to have the file that helps you
understand how it should be at 700 how it should be at 300 how it should be at
400 etc cool and for all these things that there's something that you want to do

01:10
in um if there's something that you want to do in
css and you don't know how to do it there's something you want to do in html
you don't know how to do it mdn the mdn will always have the answer
the mdn has never let me down they always have it there's a great
article on it and it will be uh a a real savior as you kind of go
through the basics of html and css i just keep the mdn up i always have a tab
for the mdn up whenever i'm doing front end stuff it's just up it's just easy to
be able to reference it and whenever i actually kind of find something cool i
add it to my inky all right so let's code some basic css in the
uh materials for today which are on discord exclamation point discord or
leon noel.com discord if you're watching on youtube
you can join once you agree to the rules you agree to the join 100 devs by

01:11
clicking the emojis you'll see the follow along materials channel you can
download all the materials that we're going to be using today there i've
already downloaded them i've already opened i've already unzipped the folder
i've already opened the entire the entire folder
uh in my vs code so i already have it all open
the reason why i like to open the entire folder is because then i get all of my
lovely folders already there to go and we are going to up we're going to work
through the the some basic css we're going to do this basic css 2. all right
so here you go we have some some things we have to do here css wise
um it says make the anchor tags gold 20 pixels and have a purple background uh
some have height side does more and so what i want you to do is to work through
the basic css 2 make sure you follow all the things it's

01:12
asking you to do in the css and make sure you can make these
rules come to life we're going to put four minutes on the clock
go as fast as you can and then we'll go over it all together done
uh our classes and ids as long as it doesn't say classes and ids are not
allowed sure but you don't need them for this one at all
switching rapidly they could have been using um

01:13
react or they had been using a cms that output stuff using divs
everything's always in the same spot it's always on uh discord the following
materials channel make sure you're using the files from from today
right you're going to find a different way to unzip maybe through google docs

01:14
too much here you see so we'll get some on the board for you basic css2
[Laughter] so did you ever get tired of explaining
where to find these things over and over
again no no i think we always have a lot
of folks that join us new each class and so
y'all should be listening to me right now anyway as you're working so i don't
mind patience is a virtue how do i unzip on a mac you just double click
we are doing the basic css2 would you recommend learning typescript

01:15
over javascript no learn javascript first and then
um see the beauty of what typescript provides for you
i like people to like learn the base and then understand
what benefits you get when you use other things
gotta feel a little pain to feel the blessing you know
be covering typescript nah just because it's just not necessary to get a job
i think it's a lot of fun i use it professionally sometimes but
it's just not it's just extra work to get a job that's what we care about
what is the color app for mac called it's called digital color meter

01:16
finally finish one on pace hey good job dominic should be paying for this free
advertisement all right folks come on back come on back let's do this together
no matter how far you got let's just take a look at it together all right
please make the anchor tags gold 20 pixels and have a purple background
all right anchor tags gold so we'll do color gold beautiful
uh font size of 20 pixels cool and have a background that is purple beautiful
all right please make sure the anchor tags are gold 20 pixels have a

01:17
background that's purple uh is my css saved
nope it's not you can see the you can see the i'm just pointing at my screen i
always have to fight the urge to be like no look and like and like point at the
screen like no look right there you can see it right uh you can see that the dot
is not it's it's still full so that's how you know i haven't saved beautiful
all right let's go ahead and open this in the browser
all right we can see our anchor tags gold purple lovely stuffs going on over
there so the next one please make the section
have a height of 200 pixels was there more than one section no there's only
one section so we don't need to worry about classes or ids or anything right
all righty let's go ahead and do section and let's go ahead and give it a height

01:18
of 200 pixels let's go ahead and give it a 10 pixel thick blue border so border
10 pixels solid blue lovely and a light orange background
what did you all do for a light orange background salmon
i like that there you go is salmon light i guess it's light orange right
light coral oh like coral works seen a lot of rgb values i'm trying to
get got right now we're gonna go at salmon all right let's see
how come i can't see the the salmon color or the thick blue border
how come i can't see it let me make it bigger why can't i see it

01:19
it's saved gotta refresh there we go refresh we can see it nice cool
please make the aside have a height of 300 pixels
let's go ahead and do height 300 pixels beautiful thin red border
uh thin let's just do like two pixels solid red that'll be thin enough
and a teal background background teal nice
let's just do the last one while we're here
please make the aside paragraph so the paragraph that's inside the aside so
we'll do a side paragraph that's the selector we're saying give me the paragraph
that is inside of the aside that space there one of our relationship selectors
let's go ahead and give it a color of white
let's go ahead and give it a font size of 18 pixels and let's give it a red

01:20
underline oh how'd y'all do red underlines oh some people did text decoration
so like text decoration underline red that works right let's go back uh-huh
you have to worry about the the size of it
um some other things that you might want to try and do if you like i like the
underlying red it's cool it works there's nothing extra you have to do right
but i also like i also like um border bottom we can do like two pixels solid red
right if we do border bottom and we go back
we're gonna have to do some other stuff like handling the width but the cool
thing about using border bottom is now we can use padding to push it farther

01:21
away so maybe you want maybe you don't want the border as close right
maybe we don't want the border as close maybe you want a little bit further away
we could put padding in between to like give us some room between the border so
one you have control the other you don't so pretty cool
yeah either border bottom works or the text decoration underline would work
either as good here all right i think you all did pretty good i was watching
chat go by folks were answering them i think you all did a good job on this one
good stuff as always when we're reviewing it together i'm
gonna go fast don't feel like you have to like copy along frantically i always
share my solution files on discord after class so let's move on alrighty
let's talk about some relationships i always giggle let's talk about some

01:22
relationships we have here what type of relationship what type of
relationship is this direct exactly the direct child it's saying give me a child
that exists directly inside of another element so we need a
paragraph that exists directly inside of a section that's an
example here you have a paragraph that is immediately inside of a section
there's no other gaps jumps or steps to paragraph immediately inside of the
section nice cool how about here here we have a paragraph
right a paragraph that is immediately inside of an article that's immediately
inside of a section uh so would this work would that work

01:23
chat if i put the the little carrot there that work no
because this paragraph is not the direct child of a section it's a child of the
section let's not get that wrong it is a child but it's not a direct child so we
don't use the carrot here we just have the p
with the space whenever you see that space it says find me something inside
of something so find me a paragraph that exists inside of a section i don't care
how deep it is when it's a space it doesn't matter how deep it is nice
then we also have our siblings uh right here we're saying find me a s a
paragraph whose immediate sibling before was another paragraph and so the only
one that would actually get read here would be this youtube
because if we look at twitch there's nothing above it there's no
other paragraph above it for it to be a sibling to right
there are other sibling selectors too by the way but this one we're using right

01:24
now alrighty let's code some relationships
folks let's code some relationships so i'm going back
to my folder here uh inside the same folder that you just used we have this
relationship css2 index.html css inside the css there are some things
that it wants you to do memphis thank you for the hydration cheers to you
there's some stuff that it wants you to do
no classes no ids please no classes no ids
hey cobalt glad you're finally able to join us live all right no classes no ids
uh we got four things for you to do here let's bring the the clock back

01:25
and uh let's put another four minutes on here you got it go for it
y'all did this before class no classes no ids just relationships my
favorite simple plan album thank you show no worries though
always going to be mistakes your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though line 35 you said

01:26
oh it didn't close could i um we're doing the relationship css to
these four things would you recommend free code camp for
the odin project yeah by themselves i think they're great i wouldn't do both
at the same time like i wouldn't do 100 devs and something else at the same time

01:27
just so you don't burn out engagement alert anchor tag not closed done so nice
like solving puzzles yes that's why i love the code for me you give me a a a
good coffee and a good puzzle i'm happy i'll sit there all damn day on a puzzle
and good coffee but for me coding is like solving really cool puzzles i love it
slacked on anki with this and it shows a you owe you
i'm actually doing this proud of myself you should be proud there's no you know
how people can there's not many people in this world that can do this stuff
compare it to everyone that exists you know

01:28
one isn't better than the other dolph randolph they do they do things
differently it's about finding what works for you
right everyone's gonna learn differently um from different programs and so
that's why i always say like don't don't don't let me be the arbiter of your
success this might not be the program that works best for you right
so check out other stuff make your decision uh where it gets where it gets
a little hard is when people want to dump money into a program and then
figure it out that's where you get into trouble
oh yeah between all the free stuff you find what works for you
is the ketchup crew on discord yeah you just gotta make sure that you have
access to make sure you don't have like a great username you can see all the

01:29
channels uh cinder said this has been the most
helpful in the soft self-taught because of the accountability and discipline
yeah that's the beauty of right that's what i love about 100 it's not just me
it's not just y'all it's a whole community of folks that can help and
support and you got real deadlines you gotta show up or else you miss class
right uh i think that helps a lot of folks that's why i like doing it live
all right folks come on back come on back let's go through these together
alrighty don't worry i see some people that were just just almost ready to
finish the last one it's all right you good you're good let's get in here
way better than the three times i tried the other one yeah i feel you
all right please make only just kidding yellow let's take a look at just kidding

01:30
all right so here is just kidding it is an h2
we do have other h2s on the page so how can we target just kidding
what's what's unique about just kidding that makes it different than the other
h2s on the page yeah it's inside of a section so we can do section h2
and say color yellow cool let's open this in the
browser and make sure that everything's working well all right all right cool
and then let's move on to the next one here please make only twitter red and 20

01:31
pixels let's go ahead and take a look at twitter [Music]
all right here's twitter it's inside of an anchor tag
we have anchor tags other places we do have other anchor tags so how can we
target just the twitter anchor tag yeah side a would work here right side a
right let's look was there any other this is a paragraph so we can't do like
paragraph a because that there's there's
one right here but any anchor tag that's inside of a side would work so a side a
right now the cool thing is you can skip i see a lot of people saying like aside
pa like that does work it does get more specific but a side a should work too
let's try it blur red and font size 20 pixels
cool we can see that twitter went red if you want to be more specific you

01:32
could throw in the p2 let's make really hot purple and
like wild hot larger and blue so really hot purple and then like wild
hot it's gonna be a different color let's go ahead and look at it really hot
is an h2 and like wild hot is also another h2
so maybe we could use the cascade to our benefit here
right we could do article h2 to target really hot
and then we could do article h2 plus h2 the target like wild hot
differently oh let's try that article h2 and let's make that color uh purple
beautiful and then let's do article and we'll do h2

01:33
plus h2 selecting that sibling and we'll make it larger so maybe let's
do like font size i don't know like 30 pixels and then let's go ahead and do
color blue cool let's see if this works so if it works
we should see purple and blue all right really hot is purple
and like wild hot is blue now i mentioned the cascade is helping
us here what do i mean by that chat when i say the cascade is helping us
what do i mean by that yeah it overrides right we start off
with all of our article h2s being purple and then we use the cascade to our
benefit like as we go down the page if something has more
if something has equal or more specificity enables us to override the

01:34
thing that came above so what we're saying here is hey
if there is an if there's an h2 that has
a sibling h2 that's inside of an article make that one blue and bigger
right and so all the h2s were purple and now this specific h2 down here is
gonna be blue right gonna be blue couldn't you do h2 plus h2
were there any other h2s plus h2s i don't see any so yeah maybe h2 plus h2
could have worked too by itself um because it would have been the same
amount of specificity i kind of like having the anchor of the
article so i kind of know where to go right
yeah it would have worked with just the h2 plus h2 as well last one
make only bob and pizza green only bob and pizza green is there is
there if there are three could you do h2 plus h2 plus h2 yeah you can do all the

01:35
siblings as far as you want you can go as many siblings deep as you would like
all right bob and pizza are both articles inside of an li and
how do we grab just bob and pizza but not sunshine and rainbows
oh the chat's doing it all right we could use the fact that the uls are
siblings so that could be the place where we start right we start with ul
plus ul and then we can just say like a right so let's try that ul
plus ul and then a and let's try it color green all right let's do it

01:36
all right bob and pizza are just green right because
we have the ul plus ul right that's gonna say you know what ignore this
first ul just grab the second one and then grab all the anchor tags that are
inside of it all right um a lot of folks are saying like why
don't you use the the carrots like why don't we get like
more specific here well that sorry it doesn't add specificity why don't we why
don't we make them direct well because i don't have to
and so i'm lazy and if i don't have to i won't do it uh but also it it it
really does make it more strict right and so it's up to you do you want to be
more strict or do you want to be less strict
right it's kind of a preference and it actually might be set by the team that
you join your team might always prefer like strict um direct direct childs right
and um you'd have to figure that out if you wanted to do like ul

01:37
a you'd also then have to do like the li right you'd have to if you wanted
to use the the more strict you you would have
had to like add more work here right in this case you would have had to add more
specificity and so i don't ever use the direct
carrots or the direct children unless there is a situation where i need it
yeah otherwise i just don't don't got a way to like do more work right
all right looks good working on that one as always i share
the solutions after class uh there was an error in the html
there was an error that i fixed down here twitter was an anchor tag that opened
but it closed with a paragraph i had to uh fix the error to close with

01:38
the closing anchor tag uh-huh there you go we got got together
we got got together i i got myself i went to get what i got got
it was a test i was testing y'all alrighty let's talk about ids we got engaged
engagement we're definitely oh that's that's definitely a moat it's a engagement
isn't emote it's definitely coming i got to talk to the to the designer that
helped with the other ones but yeah we're definitely doing an engagement emote
all right let's talk about ids and classes for a little bit here
uh we have ids which are unique identifiers right

01:39
it's unique identifiers uh it's a way of targeting one thing and only one thing
on the page all right hopeless said can we do more practice
yes we can do more practice i got you got more practice tonight uh ids are
unique identifiers right it was us to target one element and only one element
once you give an element an id that id cannot be reused on any element it's how
we talk to just that element and only that element right cool now
here we have hello youtube with the id of zebra right the idea of zebra this
idea of zebra cannot be used anywhere else only that paragraph and if i want to
target just that paragraph i can use the idea zebra to get there okay

01:40
classes are a little different classes we can give to multiple elements
right we can give them multiple elements right and those elements can be reused
multiple times and so here you can see this paragraph
has an id but it also has the class of bob
you can see that this paragraph also has a class of bob so when i do
my dot bob as my article sorry sorry as my selector
i am targeting both of these elements at the same time
and in fact our elements can have as many classes as you want to give them
and we can use all those classes to target elements so
you can only have one id per element then the id game cannot be re reused and
then you can give as many classes to your elements as you would like

01:41
each class is separated by a space cool all right chat
how many points of specificity does this rule have all right let's count it
we have one class and one id so one id one class and zero tags
so 110 points of specificity here and we can see it we can see all right
here's the section that had the id of pizza and then inside of it is a paragraph
that had the class of jumanji original movie aka the only one that exists anyway

01:42
next one how many points of specificity chat how many points we got here
for this rule all right let's count it out we got how many how many ids one
how many classes we got one two so two classes and we have one tag
so 121 points of specificity because there is one id
two classes and a tag and we can see that right we can see that there's
something that has the idea diet coke space so we're going to look inside
inside we can see that there is indeed a paragraph that has the class of bob
and the class of domino's pizza and it is a paragraph that's why there's

01:43
no spaces between domino's pizza bob and the paragraph
is this counting used in real life i use
it all the time it's how i know it's how i know if the content is gonna be
overwritten in the cascade dab said somebody at github pushed a bit
of bad code and they're landing pages down hey it happens right if the if the
best developers in the world are getting got we can't expect not to get got
ourselves right i feel like everyone was going everyone's going down recently
right like discord went down github's going down this is this is this is not a
good sign folks everyone's getting got already this is our last one here
how many points of specificity does this rule have folks how many points of

01:44
specificity does this rule have okay okay i see you all right we had one two ids
zero classes zero tags but we also had the bang important so that gives us
one in the other category so we have 1200 points of specificity
1200 points of specificity here boom i got alrighty
let's get some specificity practice in why don't we and so let's go back to vs
code here i'm going to close the ones that we are working on
and we have another set of practice here folks practice on practice on practice
on practice let's go so we have specificity practice sorry

01:45
yep specificity practice here there you go specificity practice is the
one we're looking at uh and you got four things to do here
please i'm gonna put five minutes on the clock for this one just give folks a
little bit more time um just to have a little bit more fun
with the highest level specificity questions so five minutes on the clock here
then we'll go over it together and then we'll probably take a break [Laughter]
in different ghosts added two minutes to the timer
so we gotta add it's now seven not seven hundred but seven minutes [Laughter]
uh there you go seven minutes folks thank you indifferent
so you can use uh channel points to increase a timer and so in different
ghosts spent the channel points to increase the timer so you had a little

01:46
bit more time to work on these the people's champion exactly i love labs
uh isn't different from the last cohort well they were here last car but they're
one of our they're the only person in the history of a hundred devs to go
through all ranks on on discord uh meaning go from helper to mentor to moderator
uh an amazing contributor to our community
has helped single-handedly hundreds of folks uh get to where they need to go
i admire leon's ability to say specificity so many times i mess it up
all the time all the time leon what do you think about using js

01:47
for data structures and algorithms yeah why not did you comment the points of
specificity next to rules to keep track nah oh no blah not the pixels
that was actually from this la this class last time it's funny you bring
that up this is this is the class that it happened yeah because of the box model
thank you yeah that clip is still up it's one of my favorites

01:48
the ufa receiver so why isaac gengar yeah called it
so behind my head hurts yeah i agree with everyone that's jumping in here get
on discord we'll help you out different said you got this exposure theory and
space repetition exactly we're gonna see all this stuff again right
gonna get lots of practice we're gonna do it all of our space repetition in
is it worth learning topics like npm websockets and webpack from scratch if
you like learning about them sure why not if you're just trying to get a job no
you know what lance crave you ever play pokken no i did for a

01:49
little while then kind of just stopped come on in folks
memphis thank you for the hydration cheers to you
ashley thank you for the good sub i'm trying to read the pasta a
how do you wrap vs code text there's a soft toggle you can turn on
if it's not already on for you by default
recovering back end in the boot camp of course
i need to send you some donna's pizza where do i send it you don't
uh random acts of pizza on on on reddit's great though

01:50
when are we starting js not for a while we gotta get through responsiveness
first what's the gift at something it's when
folks in the community give other folks that are here a sub um yeah
it's actually the only thing that has sound
like regular subbing um bits all that doesn't make sounds but gift things do
donald's are burger king definitely burger king because they have the
impossible whopper mcdonald's is getting ready to have the
mick plant but i don't i don't trust mcdonald's
family guy or bob's burgers oh that's such a hard one
i love bob's burgers but i think family guy just has like

01:51
my old older skull humor nailed down how do you feel about machine learning i
think it's dope i can't wait i want all the i want all the ai to help
me write my code a lot of people coming in done that's great
how many countries have you been to in africa i've been to quite a few
i did some research for a while so yeah it's actually a surprisingly high number

01:52
all right folks about 50 seconds left got this dig deep you can do it
i did do biology mainly biological anthropology though
you make it to ireland on your travels yep yeah been there quite a few times
mainly because like hopping planes but yeah
i started off with my uh mcb and then transitioned after like years in
at yeah we call it mcdb though for that developmental in there
what's the most beautiful country you ever visited i'm not sure that's a hard

01:53
one i think i said this last time i'm a sucker for italy i love it i like
history and like you just you're just like in it which is so cool all right
folks come on back come on back hope you had a good run hope you enjoyed
the extra two minutes uh from indifferent all right let's go over these together
boom all right please make this an ad blue
but make sure it's specific enough that you can add other h3 somewhere else in
the document all right so let's look at this is an ad all right so this is an h3
and uh we want to make it specific enough
that we could add like h3s elsewhere and so the cool thing is that this h3 is

01:54
inside of an aside so let's go ahead and just grab the
class that's on this aside um yeah let's grab the class and let's try that
oh although we do have this id up here too let's get real specific with it then
let's just while out here not because it's necessarily good code
but just to have some fun with it all right so we know that it's inside of a
section that has that id uh rugrats while thornberries is indeed the best
crossover of all time right so that's super specific
uh and then inside of that we know that we're going to grab an aside
that has this class of extra extra read all about it
cool and then we know there's an h3 in it we do that and we do like h3 right

01:55
now we could get more specific than this right maybe
we could throw the section there we could throw the aside in there right um
we could also give that h3 its own like its own id and then that would make
sure that we were specific that nothing else right but like i feel i feel this
is a a good testament here and make it blue cool and let's go ahead and
let's actually open this in the browser cool and we can see this is an ad you're
beautiful there you go just put back import and i didn't call it a day
the screen not being focused is you have to change the quality settings on your
end yeah make sure you change the quality settings and give it a refresh
sometimes if it gets too blurry yeah all right so that was good

01:56
i feel like there's no other h3s they're going to be built like unless you put
like another h3 inside of this inside of
this section i think we're good maybe we could even just to make sure that
there's like not other things that are that are going to be there we can use
the like the direct right just to be extra careful yeah just be extra careful
all right please make i like turtles red i like turtles that's that stuff that's
like like perfect og vine right i like turtles
they have to be like an adult now right like
i wonder what i wonder what they they grew up to be
maybe they're a herpetologist right maybe what wouldn't that be a story
their hepatologist now you know studying is that what those people study

01:57
turtles right or like lizards and stuff all right
i like turtles is down here i'm sorry i forgot about this being in here um i'm
removing all that imagery we won't be using that going forward but i forgot
about this id uh we have the section id here and then
we're going to change this here we're going to change changed it there we go
changed it there we go uh so i changed it and we
have i like turtles inside of it so let's go ahead and use that
uh let me save here and i'm going to go to id here i'm going to say changed it
and h2 boom and we make it red color cool let's save it let's see what we got

01:58
all right a little bit bigger cool red all righty
uh please select hello world with the highest level specificity possible oh boy
i'm gonna do this again are we gonna do this again are we
please select hello world with the highest level specificity possible
what you all get how'd you do it all right let's take a look where hello
world is let's see all right hello world is in this h2
so we definitely want to use the h2 with the section that has that id so

01:59
let's go ahead and copy it and let's go ahead and do uh section with that
id space h2 cool so that's the start right the h2 that's inside of this section
it's just inside of the section this section is the sibling of the header
with the class top so um header the class top sibling beautiful
and then the header top that is inside the body which is inside
the html so we'll do html we'll do body and then we'll go ahead and give it a
color let's just say gold and we'll do bang important
i don't know where that o came from and then we'll close it off

02:00
cool let's make sure it's gold all right so hello world is gold
can anybody add something that made it more specific you can do more
what more can we do direct relationships won't make it more specific
do head plus body oh boy um there you go right still gold
anything else folks found that they could do cool i like it
i think we're good here uh so we had an h2 that was a child of a
section that had this rugrats wild thornberry best crossover all time it

02:01
was a sibling to the header that had the class at top that was a child of the
body the body was a sibling of the head and the head was a child of the html
boom what are you sipping today leon t the normal tazos vanilla carm uh caramel
chai all right folks well done we had one more down here
i'm going to save this one for y'all i want you all to try it on your own uh
get get as specific as you can and uh maybe we'll do it together on on
uh on office hours but i'll leave this one for you just in the sake of time
because we're a little bit over where we're over time so let's go ahead
if you're new around these parts we like to be
um we like to be we like to take our our
breaks the top of the hour uh we're here for a a long time right
not a short time i don't know why and we're gonna go and put five minutes

02:02
on the timer here please if you're able get up hydrate grab some water alright
grab some water stretch if you're able let your eyes focus on something that's

02:05

02:06
not the screen and we'll be back here for you in five minutes folks ian five so
ah somebody started using studio classes that's pretty cool
i seen dragon ball super of course alien thank you for teaching do you
think ai will make a replacement for many programming jobs nope
programming is like turning business ideas into reality ai is going to help
us do that um you just won't have to look up as
much stuff it'll it'll be helpful right it'll be really helpful and it's going
to help build more products faster which means more engineers which means even
more work so i'm ready for the ai i think it's going to make our systems a
lot easier to build and this is going to
be like another tool that we use to help us
join us on discord victory happy to have you favorite pasta shape
uh i'm i'm a like a i'm like a thin spaghetti type person yeah

02:07
thoughts in the metaverse gonna happen yeah
python or javascript javascript all day ether soul oh the hard one
i love the ecosystem way more i just don't like gas so still can be fun too
well i don't i like the mechanism of gas i don't like having the pay gas
what kind of chair do you have i have a herman miller embody

02:08
come on back folks come on back hope you had a good break are you veg
i'm vegan yeah no i don't think i'm a vegetable though
alright folks come on back hope you had a good break
leon's got the monies no i did not pay for it i mean let me i've told i said
i'll keep saying this i have a amazing setup
like the the the the when i was little the thing i wanted most growing up was a
laptop didn't get one i always wanted a computer did get one
until much later right like like i always wanted computer i have the setup
of my dreams right now a beast of a laptop a beast of a pc
triple monitors dual camera gold xr two steam decks ipad the draw like i got a
beast of a setup i did not pay for a dime of it i did not pay for a dime of it
when i negotiate my salary when i negotiate my contracts

02:09
i often need more gear or things to do those jobs or to do those jobs as well um
and so i i haven't paid for any of it including my chair um so i i have this one
that i did not pay for and actually i got this herman miller embody for dollars
it is a sixteen hundred dollar chair that i got for three hundred dollars
um including my keyboard exactly i got a 300 plus keyboard i got i got one for
free and another one that i got for free again i guess because i didn't pay for
it um the the chair i knew i wanted i knew i wanted to embody
uh for a very long time and i checked craigslist every single day
all the marketplace apps every single day and eventually i saw one
that somebody listed for eight hundred dollars
and as soon as it went up i had my alerts i immediately resp sent to them hey

02:10
i saw you it posted the embody 500 cash i'll pick it up in an hour like
literally in an hour i'll be there with cash and they were like oh like that's
great like uh i can do the 500 and um can you just come pick it up
tomorrow i was like yeah hell yeah i'll come like do you want me to come i'll
literally i'm in my car the guy will come i will get it from you right now
they're like no just come tomorrow and then so tomorrow comes and they message
me saying hey i tried to clean it it it it didn't work well there's a
stain on the seat are you okay with the stain
and i was like and i was i was about to say like hell yeah like i'm still coming
i'll get it cleaned i don't care and they're like we'll knock i'll knock 200
off of it so that you can get it cleaned so i showed up and i bought the chair
for 300 cash the stain was like it looked like
somebody dropped a little bit of water on it
like it looked like somebody dropped a little water on it and

02:11
she the woman there told me she's like look i know it's an expensive chair
uh my boyfriend got it for me we're no longer together i just don't want it
anymore i was like what and she was like
yeah i just don't want it anymore so 300 and i paid the cash and i smiled my
whole way home uh with my 1600 chair that i got for 300.
and then that that 300 i didn't pay for that came out of my pd funds anyway
alrighty let's get into the box model story time's over
so talk a little bit about the box model last class let's make sure we review it
and then we're going to get some practice with it so the box model is
that every single thing in web development is a box i don't care if

02:12
it's an image a piece of text a section everything is a box it can have height
and width it can have padding and it can have border
right and it can have border and then we have something called margin not
technically box model but the margin can push the box model around so
let's get some more practice in uh let's not get got again tonight
that was pretty quick if you saw that's good on you um
let's go ahead and practice uh let's say we're gonna build a section again
all right we're gonna build a section again and let's go ahead and say a section
cool and let's give it a height of fixed uh of 50 pixels and a width

02:13
of 50 pixels and then we could do yeah let's start there height 50 pixels
all right 150 pixels with the 50 pixels and we kind of feel comfortable we know
that that's 50 pixels wide you know it's just i look over it's just all nuns
too many of you all got a good kind of moats these days too many you got to
vote too many people too many people use the jeff bezos's money uh they they
realize that they have amazon prime they can get a free sub uh and uh too many
people got gifted subs we got too many nuns in the in in this chat nowadays
i'm done i'm here john i look up it's just a wall of nuns god dang it

02:14
spell it out spell it out spill it out [Laughter] yes [Laughter] so i knew that
dab thank you for the gift it subs i knew that you could you could take the clip
or rewind the clip and so somebody knew that they could do the clip right
and then go back to it i should have just enough that you could go to the
clip and then they had to type it all out they had to type it all out and they
would be able to type it all out with the clip and uh get to get the link yes
done well done well done we got gat i it was a risk right we knew it was a
risk right we do we do there's a risk right we do we do

02:15
that oh another uh get this off hey wait it's kind of like honestly who did
the gift that subs dab thank you for the five gift of subs and
i see you just did the gifted ones there
it'll come through in a second but thank you for the gifted subs all right
let's do it again it didn't come through i'm not sure who
did get this i appreciate you before they get this up i'm sorry i just it
didn't come through on my um my log here so i appreciate you there we go
it was dab ah dab thank you for the um gifted subs all right let's do it again

02:16
so section and we have height of 50 pixels and width of 50 pixels
and that'll give us a nice square all right so now let's go ahead and
let's go ahead and let's add a border let's do a little he got worse
uh let's do a border i'm sorry don't play me blame the nuts let's add a border
actually let's change the color um so we have our our nice box
and let's add a border let's make our border red and so we'll do border

02:17
and let's go ahead and do five let's do 10 pixels uh solid red cool there we go
10 pixels solid red alrighty and that would go ahead and give us a 10
pixel border going around the whole thing cool and how how wide
is this element right now how wide is this element
70 pixels wide right because we have 10 pixels on the left
10 pixels on the right and 50 pixels in the middle nice all right

02:18
uh let's go ahead and give some padding let's go and do padding bottom
adding bottom and let's give it uh 30 pixels
and what will happen is we'll need to kind of erase the border for a second here
yep and padding padding increases the distance between the element and its
border so if we give 30 pixels of padding here we get 30 pixels of padding here
all right and that's all of our padding here all right all of our padding here
and then we have to make sure that the border goes back to where it was

02:19
there we go how tall is this element all right we got 10 pixels on the top
50 pixels so we're at 60 plus 30 so we're at 90 plus another 10 we're
at 100 so 100 pixels tall how wide are we right now how wide is the element
oh why is the element it's still right still 70 pixels wide if i had margin
right if i had margin and i added a hundred pixels of margin to the top
how tall is the element i had 100 pixels of margin to the top
how tall is the element oh yeah it's still the same right
margin pushes the box around it doesn't increase the size of the element right

02:20
it's a hundred pixels tall still it's just pushed down margins the bully it
pushed it down right if you hadn't merged to the left it'll push it over
still still the same amount of height just margin would push it down
cool well done everybody all right let's go ahead and jump back to the slides
and we're going to get some box model practice and we drew it and now let's
actually code out some elements that can that we're going to kind of play with
the box model a little bit here so let's go ahead and open up that set of code
told you folks lots of hands-on keyboard time tonight right feeling good right
feels good all right so we got this box model practice index.html
and inside the css you got some some things to do here so

02:21
let's go ahead and put five minutes on the clock here five minutes on the clock
and go ahead and go for it in five minutes this is the box model practice
actually let's do four minutes and get as fast as you can in those four minutes
okay i know you probably won't finish it in
the four but that's okay take four try and get as far as you can
speedrun exactly uh dawg pixels what's the px like 30 pixels font size yeah

02:22
miles i said wild how chat slows down during these exactly you're all doing
stuff they said you're getting to mobas nah
i've stayed away i know that that's the end of my that's like it's over it's a
wrap like i played wow for a month then i was done like never again
i didn't eat i didn't sleep i didn't go to class
just knew i couldn't couldn't live life like that i'm from south philly
favorite nba team sixers of course i would definitely wear lehan's drawing
on a t-shirt that was the merch last cohort the last cohort had the box model
exactly our box model was on there do you stay john an unhealthy amount
not as much as i did when i lived there but it still comes out like when i just

02:23
when i just don't know what to call something it does slip out
bobby lynn added two minutes to the timer all right when we when we hit two
minutes i'll make it four oh there you go four minute timer
bobby lynn added the two minutes to the timer well done well done thank you
bobby lynn for the extension slay vance hey thank you for the six
months i appreciate that are we getting to scss at all nah
something you could pick up on your own if you want
um but it's just not something we need to get a job right so if it's not
something that's gonna like materially help us get a job i don't teach it any
seagull of course up three all the time please can we finish at 9 30. now i

02:24
really do try to stick to the three the three hours i know that it's hard to do
it sometimes but i really try to know people got life and so i try to be
consistent with the time how much data structures and algorithms
we go over we'll go over a lot we'll be doing daily data structures and
algorithms practice for like a month plus
what company treats their employees the best um
i know a lot of like local boston companies that treat their employees
really well i don't know of like like national companies that i could think
off the dome yeah exactly and also an indifference
and it also depends on what you're looking for
like paying some people the most is like

02:25
you could you could throw them in a dark corner as long as you're paying them
more right people look for different things
how's your experience with tech stars i loved it that's one of the best things
i've ever done what do you think of the seattle hub i i
think it's dope like i like i mean like like of seattle i went to seattle over
the holidays and i loved it all companies make your take take leak
codes are similar nah a lot of companies
don't even give you technical interviews motherboard hey thank you for the 10
gift it subs that's wild thank you so much 10 good cells
you see they're making a new fresh prince yeah i have i i think it actually
looks pretty cool it's not like funny they're definitely going more like drama-y
i i kind of i really do love the like the campiness of the original it's one
that's what made it one of my favorite shows

02:26
but the trailer looked cool just more more modern drummy
a lot of folks coming in done we learn enough to talk about big o
notation of course yeah you'll be able to evaluate all of your
interview problems in big o done looks weird do we need to know advanced math no
not at all you don't even need like regular math

02:27
other than like calculating percentages maybe where did you learn to write
hieroglyphics from the nuns like banksy learn css
all right folks five seconds left get in here
favorite vegan fast food taco bell by far don't make like you can make
anything um yeah right and if you don't even need to calculate percentages
anymore there's calc um yeah no the taco bell will make
anything vegan you just got to say like fresco style like you you can order
anything like you remove the meat and say fresco style
and it's vegan it's beautiful talk about sponsors please all right
have you ever tried in and out their friend tries and they were horrible

02:28
i don't get it i guess maybe it's like price but the lines in and out are just
like they're just wild absolutely wild like the lines are just like around the
block every single time [Laughter] i just don't get it
i know i just offended a lot of people but i i just i just don't get it
all right folks let's get into this this is this is this is the most i've
ever seen chat pop off when i start talking about fast food places
all right please make the h1 30 pixels with a little padding on the left and a
thin red border let's select the h1 here
uh we're gonna make it 30 a font size of 30 pixels 30 pixels

02:29
a little padding on the left so padding left uh 30 pixels
and a thin red border so let's do border um
we're going to do border let's go ahead and do like three pixels solid red
and let's save this and let's open this html in the browser all right so we can
see that this h1 had a bigger font size we can see that there's a little bit of
padding on the left and we can see that it has that thin red border right now
what i like to do is i use my inspect tools
and so the reason why i asked you to use chrome for the class is just that the
tools are slightly better in chrome and there's slightly a few things that like
firefox is just a little bit harder to get to
and so i i tell people to use chrome just to get comfortable with these tools
i find even when i'm like developing and i use firefox i have to jump back to
chrome every once in a while so i just tell people to use chrome out the gate

02:30
even if you use firefox in like your day to day just for these tools so
if you right click on this text and you click inspect
that's going to bring up the inspect tool
okay it's going to bring up the inspect tool and inside the the inspect tool
there is this lovely like you're gonna see all these different panels
but i love this panel right here um the styles panel because as you
scroll let me bring it up a little bit as you scroll
you can see all of the computed css like the css that is actually
sticking like the the css that's actually running so like i could click
on the h2 and it would show me all the style in the h2 but i click on the h1
here in the elements and it's going to show me the exact css that's coming
through on that element and then there's one

02:31
other really cool thing that is if you scroll down far enough
there's this box that shows up and the box actually shows you all of the
like the actual sizing so it'll show you the size of the element like the height
and the width it'll show you the padding
it'll show you the border and it'll show you the margin and so if you look you
can see all right here is the the height and width of the element
you can see that we have the 30 the 30 pixels of padding
you can see the three pixels of border on each side and you can actually set
there's some margin that's at play too right so
if we hover over this you can actually see all right here's the element
and then when i hover over padding look look look up here look at where the
element is look up here ready three two one padding
all right see how the green shows up so that can show me that oh there there's
actually padding there if i do the border it'll actually

02:32
highlight the border so even if the border is like a weird color or it's not
on all sides you can see where it would be and then you can actually see the
margin now did we give it any margin did we give it any margin
no we didn't give it any margin and so since we didn't give any margin where is
that coming from we didn't give any more where it's coming from
yeah it's coming default from the browser and so uh we're actually going
to see this in a bit i'm going to show you how to
get rid of these defaults right like i i don't maybe i don't want this default
margin coming from the border maybe i want to start fresh maybe i want to
start without having all these margins so i'm going to show you in a few
minutes how to get rid of these defaults if you don't want them but this
inspector tool right click inspect can really save you a lot of time right i
look at this box every single day you could do

02:33
and it can show you all the stuff that's actually being computed and added and
it's just really helpful the other neat thing i just want to come
back here real quick to the css i did padding left
but i didn't have to do that there's something else you can do
if i just use the word padding and i do 30 pixels what this is going to do
is it's going to apply 30 pixels of padding
on every single side so let's go back let's refresh right now we can see that
there's only 30 on the left but as soon as i refresh can see it visually right
we can also see it here that we've gone ahead and added 30 to each to each side
right so when you do when you do just the 30 pixels it's
going to add it on all sides and it does it right it does it in a

02:34
clockwise fashion so it's going to go top right bottom
left and so you can actually override these uh in the the the line here i can do
0 30 pixels if i save that and i go back it's always
clockwise exactly always clockwise if i go back we go back to where we
originally were when i said padding left because what i've done right
what i've done is i have given it zero on the top zero
on the right zero on the bottom but 30 on the left and so you can you can do
that one for each direction top right bottom left okay the other
cool thing is it it'll repeat itself so if i was to do let's say um
supposed to do like 30 pixels zero right if i was doing 30 pixel zero what it's

02:35
going to do is it'll do 30 pixels on the top zero on the right
30 pixels on the bottom and then zero on the left so it'll it'll double up for
you right and so if we save this and we go back you can see that we have it
on the top and the bottom but none on the left or the right so
when you are writing your css you can do the hyphenated padding hyphen left
hyphen padding padding hyphen right padding hyphen top padding hyphen bottom
or you can use these um kind of shortcuts that we just talked about and
it works the same with margin as well it works the same with margin
that works the same with margin uh what do i use i typically use the shorthand
yeah all right so let's put it back to adding left just a little bit more

02:36
readable there we go all right please make the h2 25 pixels
let's go and target our h2 here let's go ahead and do um font size 25 pixels
cool let's go ahead and add padding on the
top and bottom so we can use the trick that we just did we can do padding
all right we can do padding and we can do out top and bottoms let's let's do
let's get wild with it 50 pixels on the top and then zero on the left and right
and so that'll do 50 on the top zero on the right 50 on the bottom and zero on
the left with that short hand right uh remember this this will repeat itself
so it's gonna be fifty zero fifty zero uh and then the last thing here is uh oh
sorry it's two more things here thick gold border border
let's go ahead and do uh 20 pixels solid gold
it's really thick and then a margin on the top and bottom so let's go ahead and

02:37
do margin and we'll do the same thing 20 pixels
zero it's going to add 20 on the top zero on the right 20 on the bottom zero
on the left all right let's check out this h2
we look at our h2s if we were to right click inspect on it
right you can see that it's highlighted in the html we scroll down
we can actually see the compute it we can see that there's uh the 50 on the
top 50 on the bottom 20 on the top 20 on the bottom and as you highlight through
you can see the colors changing as we roll over so here's the element here's
the padding here's the border here's the margin nice sir exactly
all right let's do the next one here please make the spans have a thin black
border okay so let's just do border uh two pixels solid black
cool a little padding they went padding on all sides let's go
ahead and do 10 pixels oh that's that's a little too much maybe five pixels cool

02:38
and blue color blue nice let's save it up see what we got
yeah look at these spans if we right click on one of the spans and we inspect it
we're going to see that we've got the padding on all sides
uh it's got the border and we're doing good here cool and we had one more here
please make the section 20 width all right so let's go ahead and do a width
of 20 25 so here a 200 pixels tall so height 200 pixels tall
centered with a thin purple border so let's do border first border two pixels
solid purple and what did you all do to center it

02:39
what did you all do to center it ah you did margin zero let's talk about it
margin zero auto so what this is gonna do is it's gonna put zero on the top
auto on the right zero on the bottom and auto on the left and so when we do that
what it does is it centers it right that margin zero auto will help center
it for us uh it's a little bit of a trick for now we'll do we'll get to way
better kind of positioning systems in the future but for now
since we're learning about margin we can we can use that that margin trick where
it's going to repeat itself zero auto zero auto right cool
eventually when we get to flex and other stuff it's different and easier but
since we're dealing with the box model and some margin now we'll throw in the
margin zero auto cool all right we got about 20 minutes left
folks 20 minutes of fun dig deep this is this was a this has been a

02:40
it's been a it's been a long one but a fun one right long one but a fun one
all right your classifier hey here all right
i have put together a template for you all
uh starting from scratch can be a little bit difficult right like you have to
create the folder and then you have to create the html file then you got to
create the css file and then you got to link the css to your html file you gotta
make sure you did it all right and so what i did is i made a template for you
so instead of having to do it from scratch every single time
right so if i can do it from scratch every single time you can just open up
my template and make a new fresh copy of
the template each time and when you make a copy of the template right we make a
copy of the template you can just start with that so let's go

02:41
ahead and take a look at the starter template and close what we just did and um
it's aptly named template so if we look at template there's html
there's actually a space for our javascript that we're not going to touch
yet right and there's css but there's a bunch of stuff in the css
right a bunch just a bunch of stuff in the css
we're going to look at the stuff that we're familiar with first we're going to
talk about it all right so here's the html we got the lovely doctype at the
top letting us know that we're using html5
our html has the lang preference lang en short for english letting us know that
that's gonna be the base language here you're gonna see some meta tags here
the first one is our utf-8 and utf-8 is just letting us know
what type of characters we're using and basically utf-8 has every

02:42
type of character you can think of okay next we have the description
uh that's what can kind of help show up when you google a website right like
that can that's that's what can show up when you when you go to you go to google
something right um that description can pop up
the meta these keywords used to be really important now not so much
uh so back in the day right back in the day there were
what we called keyword stuffing so google would come to your site and they
were trying to figure out what your site was about and they would look at your
meta tags right and so based on what we're in your meta tags right based on
what we're in your meta tags uh they would say all right this is what your
site is about okay so what do you think people started
doing uh when search engines start looking at their meta tags to figure
what their site was about they don't really do this anymore back

02:43
in the day they did they put every single thing in there if
you had a dog food website you had every type of dog in every color of dog you
had every shape of dog in every single thing about dogs and those keywords and
so then what then what google said is hey if you if you put so many keywords in
your meta characters we're just going to ignore them right
and so then what people did is instead of having all the meta keywords in the
meta tag they would come on the page and they would put all of their keywords
in the body and then just make them white so they
wouldn't show up to the user they were there for google but they wouldn't show
up in the in for the user right and so google saw this right google saw
this and they were like wait a minute that's keyword stuffing they actually
started docking you for all these bad behaviors and so
it's seo or search engine optimization is like a cat and a
cat and a mouse game here right where you um
you figure out a little a little trick or hack

02:44
and then google penalizes you and you got to figure out more and then they
penalize you again and so there's all these things that used to be
there but aren't there there is something missing from the the
top or this meta area here and that's our viewport when we get to
responsiveness we're going to come back and add one more thing here which is
viewport but right now that won't make too much sense because we haven't gotten
the response in this yet but no there's gonna be one other thing we'll add here
for viewport that'll help folks when it comes to accessibility
uh title is what shows up like in the tab
right like see like the stuff that shows up in these tabs here that's what comes
from the title and then here's the real meat and potatoes for tonight
we have two different style sheets here that i'm linking to right
two different style sheets that i'm linking to here i have normalize and
then i have my like normal style sheet okay right

02:45
i have my normalize and then i have my actual style sheet right
and so what what this does is that there's two extra css files in here
right there's a normalize and there's a reset right there's a
and there's a reset what reset will do like if you if you were to
link reset here first instead of normalize what reset will do
is it will scorch the earth it will get rid of every single default style that
comes from the browser we saw that margin that was coming default in the
browser right reset gets rid of everything right it gets rid of every
single default style right and you start from
absolute scratch your h1s are going to look exactly like your spans right
there's there's no difference for me i got used to

02:46
the default styling i wouldn't want to have to start from
nothing right i would just find that too
awkward it would take me too long and so
i use normalize what normalized means is that i keep
some of the default styling it's just that that default styling is consistent
across every browser so my h1 will be the same font size in every single
browser um and so it's up to you some of my students really like
normalize because they're already kind of used to the default styling and some
of my students hate it and they love reset because they rather start from
nothing right so it's up to you it's one of your first real decisions as a
front-end developer are you going to use normalize
are you going to are you going to use reset you can kind of choose one and go
with it but i've included both for your enjoyment all right and then the last
thing here is we have a link to our javascript we're not ready for that
one thing i want to show you in the default style sheet is that i've
included the box model hack for you and i've included some other kind of

02:47
handy things that might help you if you're using floats so we have the box
model hack we have clear fix and we have clear and then we have some like just
maybe some ways that you can start organizing your css don't worry about
this for now when we start actually using the template we start practicing
we'll go all we'll go over all this stuff as we get deeper into layout we'll
we'll talk more about clear fix and all that fun stuff we talked a little bit
about it during office hours but we're going to see it a lot more next week so
this is a template for you i recommend uh just keeping a clean copy on your
desktop right that's what i do i just have a i have a zip file
i have the template zip file on my desktop and whenever i need to start a
new project i just double click on it and i drag my desktop and we're gonna
we're gonna we're going sorry drag it to vs code and we're gonna add a few more
things to it like i said over time as we get deeper into
uh responsiveness we'll add some stuff so as we get deeper into javascript
we'll add some stuff but it's a good place to start all right

02:48
you had some layouts that were due for homework right
um you had some some layouts that were due for a homework that that um
i asked you to work on and there's three of them and i asked you to use floats
how dare right and so what i want to do is i want to talk briefly about floats
again and i want to do the first one together we're going to talk a little
bit about responsiveness and then we'll end with a raid so remember what floats
we're we're here for a good time not a long time right as
drake would say uh because we're only going to use them for a little while
all right we're only going to do them for a little while
and we're going to use them to help maybe understand a little bit more about
the box model right uh we're gonna we're going to uh use them to help aid our
idea of like how things sit next to other things right and then we're gonna
move on to flex and all the other good stuff that can come so here we have uh
this idea floats when you float an element it wants to go up as much as it

02:49
can go and to the left as much as it can go if you're floating it left
and if you float it right it's going to go up as much as it can go and to the
right as much as it can go fighting to get into those corners
right and so the side effect when you float stuff is that it winds up sitting
next to each other all right so here is the first layout
if we are looking at this layout um we can kind of maybe make some guesses
we don't really have enough content to make the pure semantic decisions that we
would need to make right the pure semantic decisions that we need
to make we just don't have enough content to make them so we're going to
use our best guesses so if you were kind of just taking your best guess what
might you make this what could that be better how about this one yep footer

02:50
and then for all three of these what could you have used we start all
five of those what could you have used just a section right section so what i
did is i did header footer section section section section section
cool all right let's uh let's use our template and see if we can build this
out quickly all right so i know in the body i'm going to have my header
beautiful and i know i'm going to have my section and i know i'm going to have
like i was gonna have uh five of these and then i'm gonna have my footer
so i have my header one two three four five sections and a footer
when i don't have content inside i like to keep them on the same line right some

02:51
people still like to always break them but if i um if i want to
if i if i'm going to put in content then i keep them on the same line yeah cool
all right so we got the header we got our sections we got our footer if we
look at the image we could make all the sections the same
except for maybe the bottom two right so what i'm going to do is i'm
going to give these bottom two sections a class
and they're big and on the bottom so i'm going to give these last two
i'm going to give these last two a class of big bottom there we go
so those two sections have the class big bottom
and uh i don't like using like numbers in my class names or anything like that
so i don't like using like two sections or something like that because um

02:52
you just run into trouble when you use numbers because what if somebody came
along and like put another section here and then this one's called one and this
one's called two right it just doesn't make sense so i try to be descriptive of
what they are they're big and they're on the bottom so big bottom cool
let's go ahead and start writing out our css
i have like a place for my layout here and i'm just gonna i'm gonna combine my
header and footer into one go right like if we if we look the header and footer
are exactly the same so what we're going to do
is we're going to do our header and then do our comma footer right footer
and let's just go ahead and give it a a height of 100 pixels
let's give them a border of um two pixels solid black
and i think that's we'll do for now and let's go ahead and open this in the

02:53
browser and see what we get all right so we got our header that's showing up
right we got a header showing up and we got the the footer that's showing up
cool you have to set the width because we want them to be the full width anyway
uh so that's the header and footer and then let's just go ahead and get
those sections done so section uh we know if we look
that by default we probably just want our sections to be like 33 percent width
um and then we'll fix the other two sections with the class
so i'm going to go ahead and give them a height i don't know let's get a little
bit more height than the let's do like 300 pixels of height let's give them a
width of 33.333 percent repeating of course
uh and then let's give them a border two
uh let's do two pixels solid black and i
don't care i don't have to calculate the border here why

02:54
why don't i have to calculate the border here
yeah because i have the border box up top right
i already gave you the bangers here right i already gave you the box sizing
border box for you and the template you don't have to remember it anymore it's
just there for you looking out for y'all what can i say
all right let's go ahead and save this and see where we're at
beautiful all of our sections here one two three four five then the footer
so let's go ahead and get them sitting next to each other
uh maybe we can just like float them as well cool
now they should be sitting next to each other and we have a problem
what happened to our footer yeah it slid on it slid on up it

02:55
collapsed right well it slid up we had our we had our we had our sections here
and our footer was nice and good but as soon as we floated the sections this
footer went zoop and slid up underneath until it hit the header right so we need
that clear both i see you all in chat let's go ahead and put a clear both on
our footer we're also technically putting on the head on the header it
just doesn't matter cool all right looking good we just need
these last two sections the big bottoms uh to be
wider right we need them to be wider they're 33 percent right now we just got
to make them 50 and so let's go ahead and create our class here uh big bottom
and let's give it a width of 50 percent right i think that should do it
boom there we go we got our we got our layout right

02:56
header footer three sections two bigger sections on the bottom um maybe if
you're like looking at it maybe these are a little bit taller in height maybe
uh maybe these are a little bit shorter you could play around the the specifics
here but we got the layout right we got the layout cool
so we got the layout uh if you want to see the other two layouts
we're gonna do those during office hours
and we'll also take a look at the simple leon lab as well so this office hours
will probably be a little less questions and a little bit more code so if you
want to see the other ones come through chill office hours we'll chill out we'll
hang we'll go through these layouts and then as we have extra time
we'll answer questions as well i remember the and the those office
hours are always vods here on twitch you can always go back and watch them
cool all right i want to hint at one more thing and i when i say hint
i really do mean a hint i don't want to go too deep into it all next week will

02:57
be responsiveness and so i just want to i just want to slightly slightly kind of
slightly kind of just like peek into this realm of responsiveness okay
and so what we want to do is i just want
to cover responses just a little bit and then all next week will be
responsiveness so when i talk about responsive websites what do i mean i
mean about i mean that i want our sites to be able
to look good across all of our devices i want them to look good on desktops
tablets mobile phones right i don't want
them to just be for one screen right and so when it comes to building responsive
websites uh there's some there's things we got to keep in mind some things we
have to learn on how to do this and what do i mean by responsive well
we can actually see examples of what fixed websites used to look like and
what more modern responsive websites look like so if we look here is ups website

02:58
from 2017. this is from april of 2017. look at this look at all this white space
you opened it up it this is not this is not me messing it up
this is not me like oh leon they had some like no this is this is what it
looked like when you opened it up they just did not care they like you had all
this extra screen you could do whatever the heck you want with this right
um and they just didn't care right uh so this is what we call a fixed website
we're gonna talk through next week like maybe why such a large company still had
a fixed site and like why it was this bad but this is the idea of fix it's not
responsive it won't look good across any of your
devices there's a lot of white space on the other hand we have a site that's
like really responsive and if we look at it you can see as i
make the window smaller you can see that like we we drop
that column that was on the on the right hand side that column disappeared as we
get even smaller the other column disappears and we just kind of start

02:59
focusing on the stuff that matters right and so you can see on on like a mobile
type screen size it's just like the important news
and as we get bigger we add more stuff right and so the cool thing about
boston.com is that it's a news website right it's a news website so what do you
think fundamentally changed about how people consumed the news not too long ago
what do you think fundamentally changed about how people consume the news
yeah if you're in a metro area right if you're in a metro area
and you want to consume new news right you want to consume news well guess what
you probably consumed news on your mobile phone
and if this site wants to keep you as a user if they want to keep you

03:00
as somebody that's going to read their news and and see their ads they need to
make their site look good on mobile phone they need to make their site look
good on tablet so that when people are like peak news reading while they're on
their commute they get to keep that audience right and so
boston.com used to have a horrible website and then they went really full
born on responsiveness because it really does help them like everybody's on
phones right now like the the mobile revolution changed everything when steve
jobs walked on that stage and said iphone it everything changed there was
mobile phones before that but that that changed right and a lot of most internet
traffic is mobile traffic now so if your site does not look good across these
devices then um that's it cool all right let me talk about the mechanism that
makes this happen and then we'll do our we'll end for the night and we'll do our
raid the mechanism that enables our sites to be responsive is something

03:01
called a media query we can add media queries to our site and
what that's going to enable us to do is it'll give us the ability
to display certain rules right certain rules at certain screen sizes
so this rule right here would only exist
between 0 pixels and 600 pixels wide and let me i'm just going to copy this i'm
going to show it in our template from the layout we just did
and so here's the layout and what i'm going to do is in my i'm
going to go down here to additional styles i'm going to put this media query
and i'm going to say between 0 and let's say 0 and 800 pixels let's make
our sections have a background of blue alright we're just hinting i just want
to show you right i just want to show you the uh
how this could work right so here it is it's a media query we're saying between

03:02
a screen size of 0 and 800 these rules should take effect so this background
blue should only happen right should only
happen between 000 and 800 pixels let's go ahead and save
let's go back to our layout let's refresh and then let me let me start shrinking
this screen size here [Music] i hit 800 pixels and boom it changed blue
go above 800 pixels that rule does not apply
under 800 pixels blue above 800 pixels that rule does not apply and so with
these media queries we can start to add some real magic to our sites we can
start to be able to look at the viewport or the size of the screen and start
making changes when it comes to responsiveness we're not just talking
about style we're also talking about content decisions so that's the big goal
for next week the big goal for next week is we know a little bit about layout we

03:03
can start to layout these sites real cool we're going to start building more
sites um with better and more feature-rich layouts next week we're
going to get some practice in on sunday with layout so if you want to see the
other three layouts that we had for homework come on office hours we'll do
them together we will have our alumni uh twitter space tomorrow at 6 00 p.m
